PREFACE 

TO 

THE AMERICAN EDITION. 

I H^vE often been surprised to observe how far 
the art of Cooiosrt in the United States is behind 
the age. It was therefore with much pleasure that 
I undertook, at the request of the publishers, to su- 
perintend an American edition of this new work of 
Miss Acton, when, on examination, I found how 
well it was adapted to the wants of .this country, at 
the present time. 

The Preface of the Author is so complete, and 
explains so fully her wishes and motives in publish- 
ing, that I have little to add, except to state that, as 
the work is presented solely as the result of the 
Author's experience, it would have been inconsistent 
with the plan' to make many additions. Therefore, 
the few which have been made, refer chiefly to the 
preparation of those articles which may be regarded 
as more strictly American: such as Indian Com, 
Terrapins, and some others. Whatever revision has

xviii raEFACB to thb amxrican edition. 

taken place, is in reference to the use of a few arti* 
cles and terms not generally known here, for which 
substitutes are presented, so as to adapt the work to 
this country. The additional matter will be found 
distinguished by brackets [ — ^]. 

This work has been so well received in England, 
as to have already passed to a second edition ; en- 
joying the universal approbatioQ of the press, and 
the general favour of the public. I cannot but feel 
persuaded that, when known, it will prove equstlly 
satisfactory to the housekeepers of this country, and 
find its wa,y into the hands of all who wish to im- 
prove in the Art of Cookery.

PE£FACE 

' TO 

THE ENGLISH EDITION. 

The prpper and whcdesome prepuratioii of our daily fbodf thoogh 
it may hold in the estimation of the world but a very ^umUe 
place among the useful arts of lifcy can scarcely be considered an 
atec^ther unimportant <Hie,.involviQg so entirely, ^is it does, bodi 
health, ^nd comfort. 

England is, beyond most other countries, rich in the Taned and 
abundant produce of its soil, or ofiUs tammeree^ which in tom 
supply to it all that the necessities or the luxury of its people can 
demand ; yet, until within Yery recent years, its codceiy has je« 
mainedJar inferior to that .of nations much. less advanced in civili- 
zation; and. foreigners have been called into fi«n]sh:tD the tables 
of our axistocra&y, and of the ivealthicnr ordenstof the coEmnunity, 
those jefinenients of the art which wave .vfid .to ;be obtajnediiaa 
natiye.taleiit. 

Our improvement was for a long time opposed by our ovm 
strong and stubborn prejudices against innovation in general, and 
against the innovations of strangers in particular ; but these, of 
late,. have fa^t given way before Uie. more, rational and libeiiOLl i^iiit 
of the times: happily for ouFselves, we have ceased to !be too 
bigoted, or too, proud to profit by the sup^or infonnatifm and ex« 
perience of. othem ,upon any subject of utility. The present age 
is one «of ^rapid '«nd univeraaUy ^progressing Imowledge; and 
nothing -which is reaEy calculated to advance either the rgreat or 
/Ae .999uii? interests (^ society is now regard^ as IsQO.homely or too 
insignificant. for notice. The details^pf dcxnestic economy, in par- 
ticular, are no looger sneered at as beneath the attention of the 
educated and accomplished; and the truly refined, intelligent, and 
high-minded wnm^ of England hare ceased, in these days of 
comparative good jiense, to consider their ^acquaintance with sucl^ 



ZX FBSFA€E TO THB SNOLISH EDmOK. 

details as inconsistent with their dignity, or injurious to their attrao 
tions :— end who can direct their households with the same taste, 
the same^udgment, and the same watchful care for the comfort of 
others as themselves ? Who, indeed, can guard all the interests of 
home as they can T And surely a woman does not preside less 
pleasingly in her own immediate circle, nor do the hcmours of her 
table, or of her drawing-room, with less grace and propriety for 
having given (often from pursuits much more congenial to her) 
some portion of the day to the examination and control of her do* 
mestic afiairs ; it is rare, too, we should suppose, for a husband to 
be otherwise than grateful to his wife for the exertion of a surveil* 
lance which, if steadily and judiciously maintained, will afiect his 
expenditure beyond all that a careless calcuktoif would imagine 
possible. This, at a period when the struggle for income is so 
general, and the means of half the famiUes holding a certain rank 
in the world axe so insufficient for the support of their position, is 
a consideratiim of very deep importance. 

Few things are more certain to involve persons of narrow for- 
tune in painful difficulties than the ruinous, because constant 
(though not always perceptible) extravagance which so often exists 
in every department of a house of which the sole regulation is 
left to servants, who, more 4han any other class of people in the 
world, would appear to be ignomnt of the true value of money, 
and of the means of economizing it. We speak, of course, of the 
generality. Some amongst them there are, we know, equally 
trustworthy and conscientious, who protect, their employers' pro- 
perty from abuse more scrupulously even than if it were their 
own ; but the greater number are reckless enough in their waste- 
ful profusion when uncontrolled by the eye of a superior : an in- 
experienced housekeeper cannot be too soon aware of this. It 
sometimes happens, however, that the young mistress of a family 
has had no opportunity before her marriage of acquiring the 
knowledge which would enable her to conduct her household con- 
cerns as she could desire ; and that, with a high sense of her 
duties, and an earnest wish to fulfil them to the utmost, she is pre- 
vented by her entire ignomnce of domestic affiiirs from accom- 
plishing her object. In such a case, unless she should chance to 
possess that rare treasure of common English life, a superior

ODoky* the economy of her taUe will not be amongst the lightest 
of her difficulties ; and she may be placed, perhaps, by cixcom* 
stances at a distance ^m eyery friend who coald counsel or assia^ 
her* l^iown thiu entirely upon her own resomrces, she wiH na* 
tunilly and gladly ovaM herself of the aid to be derived from sudi 
books as can rraUy afibcd to her the infonmition ahe requires. 
Many admkably calculated to do diis, in part, are already in pos* 
session of the public; hut amongst lihe faurge number of works ca 
9ookenf9 which we have carefully perused, we have never yet met 
with one which appeared to us either quite intended for, or en« 
tirely suited to the need of the totally ines^rienoed; none, in 
&ct, which contained the first rudim^its of ihe art, with directions 
so practical, dear, and simple, as to be at once understood, and 
easily followed, by those who had no previous knowledge of jdie 
subject, llus deficiency, we have endeavoured in the present 
volume to supply, by sucli thorou^y expficit and minate instrac- 
tions as may, we trust, be readily comprehended and carried out 
by any class of learners; Our receipts, m(»eover, wi& a few 
trifling exceptions wiiich are scrupulously specified, are confined 
to such as may be perfectly depended on^ from having been proved 
beneath our own roof and under our own personal inspection. 
We have trusted nothing to o&ers; but having desired sincerely 
to render the work one of genuine usefulness, we have spared 
neither cost .nor kbour to make it so, as the very plan on which it 
has been written must of itself, we thixik, evidently prove. It 
contains some novel features, calculated, we hope, not (mly to faci- 
litate the labours of the kitchen, but to be of service likewise to 
those by whom they are directed. The principal of these is the 
summary appended to the receipts, of the different ingredients 
which they contain, with the exact proportion of each, and the 
precise time required to dress the whole. This shows at a glance 

* It can scarcely be expected that good cooks should abound amongst us, if 
we consider how very few receive any training to fit them for their business. 
Every craft has its apprentices ; but servants are generally lefl to scramble^ 
together as they can, from any source which accident may open to them, a 
knowledge of their respective duties! We have often thought, that schools in 
which these duties should be taught them thoroughly, would be of far greater 
benefit to them than is the half-knowledge of comparative un-useful matters 
so firequently bestowed on them by charitable educationists.

what articles have to be prepared beforehand, and the hoar at 
which they must be ready ; while it affords great fecility as well, 
for an estimate of the expense attending them. The additional 
space occupied by this closeness of detail has necessarily pre- 
vented the admission of so great a variety of receipts as the book 
might otherwise have conkprised ; but a limited number, thus com- 
pletely explained, may perhaps be more acceptable to the reader 
than a Iiuger ma» of materials viHTiely giyen. 

Our directions for boning poultry, game, &c., are also, we may 
venture to say, entirely new, no author that is known to us having 
hitherto afibrded the slightest infonnation on the subject ; but while 
we have done our utmost to simplify and to render intelligible this, 
and several other processes not generally well understood by ordi- 
nary cooks, our first and best attention has been bestowed on those 
articles of food of which the consumption is the most general, and 
which are therefore of the greatest consequence ; and on what are 
usually termed plain English dishes. With these we have inter- 
mingled many foreign ones which we know to be excellent of 
their kind, and which now so far belong to our national cookery, 
as to be met with commonly at all refined modem tables. But we 
find that we have, in every way, so &r exceeded the limits assigned 
to us for our volume, that we feel compelled- to take here our some- 
what abrupt leave of the reader ; who will, no doubt, discover 
easily, without our assistance, both jmy merit and any deficiency 
which may exist in the work.

MODERN COOKERY. 

CHAPTER L 

SOUPS. 

rantODUOTORT RKBL&BKS. 

The art of preparing ffood, wholesome, palatable soupe» without great 
expense, which is so well understood in France, and in other countries 
where they form part of the daily food of all classes of the people, has 
hitherto been very much nefi^lected in England and America : it is one, 
therefore, to which we would particularly direct the attention of the 
cook, who will find, we think, on^a careful perusal of the present chai>- 
ter, that it presents no difficulties which a common degree of care and 
skill will not easily overcome. The reader, who^ay be desirous to 
excel in it, should study the instructions given under the article Botii/- 
Um, where the principles of this branch of cookery are fully explained. 

The spices and other condiments used to give flavour to soups and 
gravies should be so nicely proportioned that none predominate nor 
overpower the rest ; and this delicate blending of savours is perhaps 
the most difficult part of i cook's task: it is an art, moreover, not 
easily acquired, except by long experience, unless great attention be 
combined with some natural refinement of the palate. 

A zealous servant will take all possiUe pams on her first entrance 
into a fgimily, to ascertain the particular tastes of the individuals she 
serves ; and will be guided entirely by them in the preparation of her 
dishes, however much they may be opposed to her own ideas, or to her 
previous practice. 

Exceeding cleanliness, both in her personal habits and appearance, 
and in every department of her work, is so essential in a cook, that no 
degree of sKill, nor any other ^ood qualities which she may possess, can 
ever atone for the want of it The very idea of a dirty cook is so 
revolting, that few people will be induced to tolerate the reality ; and 
we would therefore most strongly urge all* employed in the culinary 
department of a household, who may be anxious for their own success 

*■ An active, cleanly, and attentive kitcten-maid will generally become an admiraMe 
eook.

io life, or KdicitooB to obbtin the respect and appfobatkn oT their em- 
ptoyer^ to strive to the utmost agftinst any tendency to BloveDlineee of 
which the; may be coosciotw, or which may be pointed out to them by 



Hodgrn CopiKr Boup « Stock Pot. 



In whaterer veeeel mMp is boiled, wo Aat it be perfect]; clean, and 

let the inside of the cover and the rim be equall; so. Wash the meat, 
and prepare the vegetables with great nicetj belbre the; are laid into 
It; and be careiul to keep it always closely abut when it ia on tJie lire. 
Never, on an; account, set the soup by in it, but strain it off at once 
into a clean pan ; and fill the stock-pot unmedialel; with water : pursuis 
the sime plan with all slewpans and saucepans directly they are 

Skim the eoup thoroughly when it J&-»( begins to boil, or it can never 
afterwards be rendered clear; throw in some salt, which will assist to 
brine- the scum t4*the surface, and when it has all been taken off, add 
the nerbs and vegetables; firt if not loflg stewed in the soup, their 
flavour will prevail too strongly. Remem&er, that the trinuningB, and 
especially the bonei of fresh meat, the necks of poultry, the liquor in 
which a joint has been boiled, and the shank-bones of mutton, are all 
excellent additions to the atoCk-pot, and should be carefully reserved 
ferit 

Let the eoup heat gndnall; over a moderate fire, and after it has 
been well sfcimmed, draw it to the aide of the stove and keep it rim- 
tntritiff loftlj/, but without ceasing, until it is done ; for on this, as ^ill 
hereafter be shown, its excellence principally depends. Bvei; good 
cook understands -perfectl; the diflerence produced by the ftst boiling, 
OT the gentle itev>mg of soups and gravies, and will adhere strictly to 
the latter method. 

Pour boiling water, in small quantitiee at &TBt, to the meat and 
vegetaUes of which the soup is to he made when the; have been fried 
OT browned; but otherwise, add cold water to the meat 

Unless precise orders to the contrary have been given, onions, eecha- 
lots, and gariic, ^ould be used for seasoning with great moderation 
Rlwa;s ; for not only are the; very ofiensive to many eaters, bnt to per- 
sons of delicate habit their eSbcts are sometimes extreme!; prejudi- 
cial ; and it is only in cguse cookery tb^t their flavour is allowed erer 
atrongly to prevail 



A Bmall proportion of dd^r, about an ounce t6 the ga1te» w91 very 

much improve the flavour of grav^-stock, and of all rich brown Boaps ; 
It raay*be added aliso to some others with advantage ; and finr tbia, direc- 
tions will be given in the proper places. 

Two ounces of salt may be allowed for each gallon of aoup or broth 
in which large quantities of vegetables are stewed ; but an ounce and 
a half will l^ sufficient for such as contain few or none; it is always 
easv to add more if needftil, but ov^rsaiting in the first instance is a 
&ult fer which there is no remedy but that of increasing the propor- 
tions of all the other inf redients, and stewing the whole afresh, which 
occasions needless trouble and expense, even when time will admit of 
its being done. 

As no particle of fat should be seen floating on your soups when they 
are sent to table, it is desirable that the stock should be made the day 
before it is wanted, that it ma^ become quite cold, when the fiit may be 
entirely cleared off without difficulty. 

When cayenne pepper is not mixed with rice-flour, or with any other 
tliickening, grind it down with the back Of a spoon, and stir a little 
liquid to it before it is thrown into the stewpan, as it is apt to remain 
in lumps, and to occasion great irritation of the throat when swal- 
lowed SOw 

Serve, not only soups and sauces, but all your difihes, as hot a$ pos- 
sible. 

T^ THiCxsN ipoinnt 

Except lor White soope, to which anow^root is, We think, more appro- 
priate, we prefer, to all other ingredients generally used for this purpo8e«< 
the finest and f^edieet rice^flour, which alter being passed through m 
ktWft-sieve, should be thoroughly blended with the salt, poiknded spices^ 
Catsup, or wine, required to finish the flavoiuring of the soup. Sufficient 
liqvAd should be added to it very gradually to. render it of the consis- 
tency of batter, and it should also & perfectly smooth ; to keep it so, it 
should be moistened dparinglj^, at first, and beaten with the back of a 
^poon until eveiy lump has disappeared. The soup should boil quickly 
when the thickening u stirred into it, and be simmered for ten minutea 
afterwards. From an ounce and a half to two ounces of rice-flour will 
thicken sufficiently a quart of soup. 

Instead of this, arrow-root or the condiment known by the name of 
iouM les moisj which greatly resembles it, or petato-ionr, or the French 
thickening called rowe (see page 92) may be used in the following 
proportions: — ^Two and a Balf ounces <^ either of Uie first three, to four 
pints and a half of soup ; to be mixed gradual^ with a little cold stock 
or water, Eitirred into the boiling soup, and simmered for a minute. 

Six ounces of flour with seven of butter,* will be re<|uired to thicken 
a tureen of soup ; as much as half a ponnd is sometimes used ; these 
must be added by degrees and careflilly stirred round in the soap until 
smoothly blended with it, or they will remain in lumpa 

All the ingredients used for soups should be fi*e^, and of ^ood ({nalityi 
particularly Italian pastes of every kind (macG«,roni, vermicelli, ^ca)f

as they oontiact, by long keeping, a pecnliarly unpleasant, mus^ 
flavour. 

- Onions, freed from the outer skin, dried gradually to a deep brown, 
in a slow o.ven, and flattened, will keep for almost any length of time, 
and are extremely Jiseful for heightening the colour and flavour of 
broths and gravies.* 

TO IHT miBAD TO 8EEYS WITH SOCP. 

Cut some slices a quarter-inch thick, from a stale loaf; pare off the 
crust, and divide the bread into dice, or cut it with a deep paste-cutter 
into any other form. For half a pound of bread put two ounces of the 
best butter into a frying-pan, and when it is quite melted, add the 
bread ; keep it turned, over a gentle fire, until it is equally coloured to 
a very pale brown, then drain it from the butter, and dry it on a soft 
cloth, or a sheet of paper placed before a clear fire, upon a dish, or on 
a sieve reversed. 

SIPPETS A UL REINE. 

Having cut the bread as lor common sippets, spread it on a dish, and 
pour over it a few spoonsfiil of thin cr.eam, or of good milk ; let it soak 
for an hour, then fry it in fresh butter of a delicate brown, drain, and 
serve the sippets hot 

TO MAKE N0UILLE8 ; (an elegant substitute for Vermicellu) 

Wet, with the yolks of four eggs, as much fine, dry, sifled flour, 
as will make them into a firm, but very smooth paste. Roll it out as 
thin as possible, and cut it into bands of about an inch and a quarter in 
width. Dust them lightly with flour, and place four of them one upon 
the other. Cut them obliquely in the finest possible strips; separate 
them with the point of a knife, and spread them on writing paper, so 
that they may dry a little before they are used. Drop them gradually 
into the boiling soup, and in ten minutes they will be done. 

Various other forms may be given to this paste at will. It may be 
divided into a sort of riband maccaroni ; or stamped with small confec- 
tionary cutters into different shapes. 

VEGETABLE YERMiCELU ; {vegetables cut very^ne for Soups.) 

Cut the carrots into inch len^hs, then pare them round and round 
in ribbons of equal thickness, till the inside is reached ; next cut these 
ribands into straws, or very small strips ; celery is prepared in the samcr 
way; and turnips also are first pared into ribands, then sliced into 
strips: these last require less boiling than the carrots, and attention 
must be paid to this, for if broken, the whole would have a bad appear- 
ance in soup. The safer phin is to boil each vegetable separately, till 
tolerably tender, in a little pale broth (in water, if this be not at hand), 
to drain them well, and put them into the soup, which should be clear* 
only a few minutes before it is dished. For cutting them small, in 
other forms, the proper instruments will be found at the hardware-shops.

This soaii, or broths as wd should 
perhaps designate it ia Eagland^ is 
made once or twice in the week, in 
every &naily of respectability in Fruice ; 
and by the poorer classes as often as 
their means will enable them to sub*

soups, on which they are more com- 
monly obliged to subsist It is served 
_ usually on the first day, with slices of 

'^aS.ii:?S:«J!pi,.'"' «nt«it^ >^ «^k«l i? it ; .o» the 

second, it is generally varied With ver* 

micelli, rice, or semoulina. The ingredients are, of course, often other- 
wise proportioned than as we have given them, and more or less meat 
is allowed, according to the taste or circumstances of the poisons for 
whom the bouillon is prepared ; but tiie process of making it is always 
the same, and is thus described (rather learnedly) by one of the most 
skilful cooks in Europe : " The stock or soup-pot of the French artizan," 
says Monsieur Car^me, " supplies his principal nourishment ; and it is 
thus managed by his wife, who, without the sligfhtest knowledge of 
chemistry, conducts the process in a truly scienti£c manner. She first 
lays tlie meat into her earthen stock-pot, and pours cold water to it ia 
the proportion of about two quarts to three pounds of the beef;* she 
then places it by the side of the fire, where it slowly becomes hot ; and 
as it does so, the heat enlarges the fibre of the meat, dissolves the 
gelatmous Substances which it contains, allows the albumen (or the 
muscular part which produces the scum) to disengage itself and rise 
to the sur&ce, and the ozmazomb (which is the most savoury part of 
the meat) to be diffused through the broth. Thus, from the simple 
circumstance of boiling it in the gentlest manner, a relishing and nutri- 
dous soup will be obtained, and a dish of tender and palatable meat ; 
but if the pot be placed and kept over a quick fire, the Mumen will 
coagulate, harden the meat, prevent the water from penetrating it, and 
the osmazome f^om disengaging itself; the result will be a brcSh with- 
out flavour or goodness, and a tough, dry bit of meat'* 

It must be observed in addition, that as the meat of which the 
houiUon is made, is almost invariably sent to table, a part of the rump, 
the mouse-buttock, or the leg-o^mutton piece of beef, should be selected 
hr it; and the simmering should be continued only until this is perfectly 
tender. When the object is simply to make good, pure-flavoured beef 
broth, part of the ebia, or leg, with a pound or two of the neck, will 
best answer the. purpose. When tbe bouilli (that is to say, the beef 
which is boiled in the soup) is to be served, land it into a good shape, 
add to it a calfs foot, if easily procurable, as this much unproves the 
quality of the bouillon s pour cold water to it in the proportion men- 
tioned above, and proceed as Monsieur Car^me directs, to heat the soup 
slowly by the side of the fire ; remove carefully the nead of scum, 

* This is a large proportion of meat for the family of a French artizan ; a pound to 
tb» aaart would be nearer the reality : but it is not the refbse-meat which utrottld be 
piirciiaMd by perttms of the same rank in England for masing broth.

which will gather on the surface, beibre the boiling oommences, and 
continue the skimming' at intervals, for about twenty minutes longer, 
pouring in once or twice a little cold water. Next, add salt in the pro- 
portion of two ounces to the gallon ; this will caose a little more scum 
to rise,— clear it quite o^ and throw in three or four turnips, as manv 
carrots, half a head of celery, four or five young leeks, an onion stuck 
with six or eight cloves, a large half tea-spoonful of pepper-corns, and 
a bunch of savoury herbs. Let the whole stew tsrt softly, without 
ceasing, from four hours and a half to six hours, according to the 
quantity : the beef in that time will be extremely tender, but not over- 
done. It will be excellent eating, if properly managed, and might 
often, we think, be substituted with great advantage for the hard, half- 
boiled, salted beef, so often seen at an English table. It should be 
served with a couple of cabbages, which have been first boUed in the 
usual way, then pressed very dry, and stewed for about ten minutes in 
a little of the broth, and seasoned with pepper and salt The other 
vegetables from the bouillon may be laid round it or not, at choice. 
The soup, if served on the same day, must be strained, well cleared 
from fat, and sent to table with fried or toasted bread, unless the con- 
tinental mode of putting slices or crusts of untoasted bread into the 
tureen, and soaking them for ten minutes in a ladleful or two of the 
bouillon, be, from custom, preferred. 

Beef^ 8 to 9 lbs.; water, 6 quarts; salt, 3 ozs. (more if needed); 
carrots, 4 to 6 ; turnips, 4 or 5 ; celery, one small head ; leeks, 4 to 6 ; 
one onion, stuck with 6 cloves; pepper-corns, one small tea-spoonful; 
large bunch qf savoury herbs : (calf's foot, if convenient) to simmer 
five to six hours. 

Obs. I. — This broth forms in France the foundation dr all richer 
soups and gravies. Poured on fresh meat (a portion of which should be 
veal), inst^id of water, it makes at once an excellent consommee, or 
strong jellied stock. If properly managed, it is very clear and pale ; 
and with an additional weight of beef, and some spoonsful of glaze, 
may easily be converted into an amber-coloured gravy-soup, suited to 
modern taste. 

Obs, 2. — ^It is a common practice abroad to boil poultry, pigeons, and 
even game in the pot-au-fev, or soup-pot They should b« properly 
trussed, stewed in the broth just long enough to render them tender, 
and served immediately, w4ien ready, with a good sauce. A small 
ham, if well soaked, washed exceedingly clean, and freed entirely from 
any rusty, or blackened parts, laid with the beef when the water is first 
added to it, and boiled from three hours and a half to four hours, in the 
bouillon, is very superior in flavour to those cooked in water only, and 
infinitely improves the soup, which cailnot, however, so well be eaten, 
until the following day, when all the fat can easily be taken from it : it 
would, of course, require no salt. 

CLEAR, PALE, ORAVY-SOUP OR STOCK. 

Rub a deep stewpan or soup-pot with butter, and lay into it three 
ouarters of a pound of ham freed entirely from ^t, skin, and rust, four 
pounds of le^ or neck of veal, and the same weight of lean bee^ all 
cut into thick slices ; set it over a clear and ratlier brisk fire, until the 
meat is of a fine amber-colour: it must be ofien moved, and closely 



CHAP. 1.3 wnrps. 4B 

watched, that it may not stick to the pan, nor bam. When it is equally 
browned, lay the bones upon it, and pour in gradually four, quarts of 
boiling water. Take off the scum carefully as it rises, and throw in a 
pint of cold water at intervals, to bring it quickly to the surface. When 
no more appears, add two ounces of salt, two onions, two large carrots, 
two turnips, one head of celery, a CwoKNince fitggot of savoury herbs, a 
dozen cloves, half a tea-spoonftil of whole white pepper, and two large 
blades of mace. Let the soup boil gently from five hours and a half, to 
six hours and a half; then strain it Sirouffh a very clean, fine cloth, laid 
in a hair sieve. When it is perfectly cold, remove every particle of fat 
from the top; and, in taking out the soup, leave the sediment un- 
touched ; heat in a clean pan the quantity required for table, add salt to 
it if needed, and a few drops of Chili or of cayenne vinegar. Harvey's 
sauce, or very fine mushroom catsup, may be substituted for these. 
When tlms prepared, the soup is ready to serve : it should be accom- 
panied by pale sippets of fried bread, or sippets d la reine. Rice, mac- 
caroni in lengths or rings, vermicelli, or nouilles, may in turn be used, 
to vary it; but they must always be boiled apart till tender, in broth, or 
water, and well drained before they are slipped into it The addition 
of young vegetables, too, and especially of asparagus, will convert it 
into an elegant spring-soup; but they, likewise, must be separately 
cooked. 

ANOTHER RBCEIPT lOR ORATT-flOUP. 

Instead of browning the meat in its own juices, put it with the onions 
and carrots, into a deep stewpan, with a quarter-pint of bouillon ; set it 
over a brisk fire at first, and when the broth is somewhat reduced, let 
it boil gently until it has taken a fine colour and forms a glaze (or jelly) 
at the bottom of the stewpan ; then pour to it the proper quantity of 
water, and finish the soup by the preceding receipt.* 

Obs.—rA rich, old-fashioned English brown gravy-soup may be made 
with beef only. It should be cut from the bones, dredged with flour, sea- 
soned with pepper and salt, and fried a clear brown ; then stewed for 
six hours, if the quantity be large, with a pint of water to each pound 
of meat, and vegetables as above, except onions, of which four mode- 
rate-sized ones, also fried, are to be added to every three quarts of the 
soup, which, after it has been strained, and cleared from &t, may be 
thickened with six ounces of fresh butter, worked up very smoothly 
with five of flour. In twenty minutes afterwards, a table-spoonful of 
the best soy, half a pint of sherry, and a little cayenne, may be added 
to the soup, which will then be ready to serve. 

* The jtiices of meat, drawn out with a small portion of liquid, as directed here, may 
eaaily be reduced to the consistency in which they form what is called gUue; fur par* 
tieuiars of this, see Chapter III. The best method, though perhaps not the easiest, of 
making the clear, amber-coloured stock, is to pour a ladleAil or two of pale, but strong 
beef-broth to the veal, and to boil it briskly until well reduced, thrusting a knife, when 
this is done, into the meat, to let the juicet> escape ; then to proceed more slowly and 
cautiously as the liquid approaches the state in which it would burn, ft must be 
allowed to take a dark aniber-oolour only, and the meat must be turned, and oAen 
moved in it. When the desired point is reached, pour in more boiling broth, and let 
the pan remain off the Ute for a few minutes, to detach and melt the irlaze ; then shake 
it wM round before the boiling is continued. A certain quantity of deeply coloured 
glaze, made apart, and stirred into strong, clear, pale stock, would produce the desirod 
effiicl of this, with much leas trouble. 



44 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. 

TismacECLi soup; (Potage du VermiceCle,) 

Drop very lightly, and by degrees^ six ounces of vermicelli, broken 
rather small, into three quarts of boiling bouillon, or clear gravy soup; 
let it simmer half an hour* over a gentle fire, and stir it often. This is 
the common French mode of. making vermicelli sou|h and we can 
recommend it as a particularly good one fer family use. In England it 
is customary to soak, or to blanch the vermicelli, then to drain it well, 
and to stew it for a sh<Mler time in the soup : the quantity, also, must 
be reduced quite two ounces, to suit modem taste. 

Bouillon, or gravy-soup, 3 quarts; vermicelli, 6 oza; 30 minutes. 
Or, soup, 3 quarts; vermicelli, 4 ozs.; blanched in boiling water, 5 
minutes ; stewed in soup, 10 to 15 minutes. 

SEHouuNA SOUP ; {Soupe a la SemotUeJ) 

Semoulina is used in the same way as the vermicelli. It should be 
dropped very lightly and by degrees into the boiling soup, which should 
be stirred all the time it is being added, and very frequently afterwards; 
indeed, it should scarcely be quitted for a moment until it is ready for 
table. Skim it carefully, and let it simmer from twenty to five and 
twenty minutes. This, when the semoulina can be procured good and 
fresh, is, to our taste, an excellent soup. 

Soup, 3 quarts ; semoulina, 6 ozs. : nearly, br quite 25 minutes. 

UkOOiOLom iK>up. 

Throw four ounces of fine fi'eshf mellow maccaroni into a pan of 
fast-boiling water, with about an ounce of fresh butter, add a small 
onion stuck with three or four cloves, j: When it has swelled to its full 
size, and become tender, drain it well, and slip it into a couple of quarts 
of clear gravy-soup ; let it simmer for a few minutes, when it will be 
ready for table. Observe, that the maccaroni should be boiled quite 
tender ; but it should by no means be allowed to burst, nor to become 
pulp^. Serve grated Parmesan cheese with it 

H^ccaroni, 4 ozs.; butter, 1 oz. ; 1 small onion; 5 cloves; three- 
quarters of an hour or more. In soup, 5 to 10 minutes. 

Obs. — ^The maccaroni for soups should always be either broken into 
short lengths before it is boiled, or sliced quickly afterwards into small 
rings not more than the sixth of an inch thick, unless the cut mac- 
caroni be used ; this requires but ten minutes boiling, and should be 
dropped into the soup in the same way as vermicelli. Four ounces 
of it will be sufficient for two quarts of stock. . It may be added 
to white soup after having been previously boiled in water or veal- 
broth, and well drained m>m it: it has a rather elegant appearance 
in clear gravy-soap, but should have a boil in water before it is thrown 
into it 

* When o{ very fine quality, the vermicelli will usually require lew boiling than 
this. 

t We mnst here repeat our warning against the uae of long-kept maccaroni, ver- 
micetli, or senaoulina ; aa when stale, they will render any dish into which Chey are la 
troduoed, quite unfit for table, 

t For White Soups, omit the onion

FOTAOK AUX NOVILUfiS, OR TAUXBRimi SOUP. 

Make into nouille paste the yolks of four. fresh eggs, and when ready 
cut, drop it gradually into five pints of boiling soup ; keep this gently 
stirred for ten minutes, skim it well, and serve it quickly. This is a 
less common, and a more delicately flavoured soup than the vermicelli^ 
provided always that the nouilles be made with really fresh eggs. The 
same paste may be cut into very small diamond squares, stars, or any 
Other form, then left to dry a little, and boiled in the soup until swelled 
to its full size, and tender. 

Nouille paste of four eggs ; soup, 5 pints : 10 minutes. 

SAOO SOUP. 

Wash in several waters, and float off the dirt from six ounces of 
sago; put it into three quarts of good cold gravynstpck, and let it stew 
gently from half to three quarters of an hour ; stir it occasionally, that 
It may not burn nor stick to the stew-pan. A quarter-ounce more of 
sago to each pint of liquid, will thicken it to the consistency of peas- 
SQUp. It may be flavoured with half a wineglassful of Harvey's saucOf . 
as much cayenne as it may need, the juice of half a leiDon, an ounce 
of sugar, and two glasseis of sherry ; or these may be omitted, and good 
beef-broth may be substituted for the gravy-soup, for a simple fiimily 
dinner, or for an invalid. 

Sago, 6 ozs. ; soup, 3 quarts : 90 to 45 minutes. 

TAPIOCA SOUP. 

This is made in the same manner, and with the same proportions as 
the preceding soup, but it must be simmered fix>m fifty to sixty minutes. 

RICE SOUP. 

In France this soup is served well thickened with the rice, which is 
stewed in it for upwards of an hour and a Half, and makes thus, even 
with the common bouillon of the country, an excellent winter potage. 
Pick, and wipe in a dry cloth, eis^ht ounces of the best rice ; add it, in 
small portions, to four quarts of not soup, of which the boiling should 
not be checked as it is thrown in. When a cleat soup is wanted, wash 
the rice, gfive it five minutes' boil in water, drain it well, throw it into 
as much ooiling stock or well-flavoured broth as will keep it covered 
till done, and simmer it ver^ soflly until the grains are tender, but still 
separate ; drain it, slip it into the soup, and let it remain in it a few 
mmutes before it is served, but without simmering. When stewed in 
the stock, it may be put at once, after being drained, into the tureen, 
and the clear gravy-soup may be poured to it 

An easy English mode of making rice-soup is this : put the rice into 
plenty of cold water ; when it boils, throw in a small quantity of salt, 
let it simmer ten minutes, drain it well, throw it uito the boilmg soup, 
and simmer it gently from ten to fifleen minut^ longer; some rice 
will be tender in half that time. An extra quantity of stock must be 
iJlowed for the reduction of this soup, which is always considerable. 

WHITE RICE SOUP. 

Throw four ounces of well-washed rice into boDlng water, and in 
five minutes after pour it into a sieve, drain it wt^U, and put it into a

but ten minutes' boiling. 

Soup, 2 quarts ; rice-flour, 8 ozs. : 10 mmutes. 

CM«.-— Two dessert-spoonsful of cnrrie-powder, and thestrained juice 
of half a moderate-sized lemon, will greatly improve this soup : it may 
also be converted into a good common white soup (if it be made of veal' 
stock), by the addition of three-quarters of a pint of thick cream to the 
rfce^ 

Stock ix>b wuiiie soiti'. 

Thouffh a knuckle of veal is usually preferred for this stock, part of 
the neck will, on an emergency, answer very well. Whichever joint 
be chosen, let it be thorou^ly washed, once or twice divided, and laid 
into a delicately clean soup-pot, or well-tinned large stout iron sauce- 
pan, upon a pound of lean ham, fireed entirely from skin and fat, and 
out into thick slices. Should ver^ rich soup be wished fi>r, pour in a 
pint only of cold water for each pound of meat, bnt otherwise a pint 
and a half may be allowed. When the soup has been thoroughly 
cleared from scum, which should be carefully taken ofi^ from the time 
of its first beginning to boil, thtow in an ounce of salt to the gallon 
(morex;an be added afterwards, if needed\ two mild onions, a moderate- 
sized head of celery, two carrots, a small tea-spoonful of whole white 
pepper^ and two blades of mace ; and let the soup stew very sofUy fVom 
five to six hours, if t^e quantity be large : it should simmer until the 
meat fiiUs from the bones. The sMn of a calf s-head, a calf s-fbot, or an 
old fowl, may always be added to this stock, with good effect Strain 
it into a clean deep pan, and keep it in a cool place till wanted for use.

skimmed on its beginning to boil, throw in an ounce and a half of salt 
to the gallon, two small heads of celery, three mild, middlinjr.8ized

tender in water slightly salted; then to pound them extremely fine, and 
to mi;8; gradually with them boiling gravy-soup (or bouillon), m the pro- 
portion of a quart to twelve ounces of the carro:^ The soup should 
l^en be passed through a strainer, seasoned with salt and cayenne, and 
served very hot, with fried bread in a separate dish. If only the red 
outsides of the carrot be used, the colour of the soup will be very 
bright : they should be weighed after they are pounded. Turnip-soup

MOCK TURTLE, OB CAI<F*S HEAD SOUP. 

After having^ taken out the brain and washed and soaked the head 
well, pour to it nine quarts of cold water, brin^ it j?ently to boil, skim 
it very clean, boil it, if large, an hour and a half, lift it out, and put into 
the liquor eight pounds of neck of bee( lightly browned in a little fresh 
butter, with three or four thick slices, or a knuckle of lean ham, four 
large onions sliced, three heads of celery, three large carrots, a large 
bunch of sweet herbs, the rind of a lemon pared very thin, a desertspooo* 
fu] of pepper-corns, two ounces of salt, and after the meat has been 
taken from the head, all the bones and fragments. Stew these gently 
from seven to eight hours, then strain off the stock, and set it into a very 
cool place, that &e fat may become firm enough on the top to be cleared 
off easily. The skin and fiit of the head should be taken off together 
and divided into strips of two or three inches in len^, and one in 
width ; the tongue may be cut in the same manner, or mto dice. Put 
the stock, of w^ch there ou^ht to be between four and five quarts, into 
a large soup or stew pot ; thicken it when it boils with four ounces of 
fresh buttei^ mixed with an equal weight of fine dry flour, a half-tea- 
spoonful of pounded mace, and a third as much of cavenne (it is better 
to use these sparingly at first, and to add more should the soup require 
it, after it has boiled some litUe time) ; pour if half a pint of sherry, stir 
the whole together until it has simmered for a minute or two, then put 
in the head, and let it stew gently from an hour and a quarter to an hour 
and a half; stir it often, and clear it perfectly from scum. Slip into it, 
just before it is ready for table, three dozens of small forcemeat-balls ; 
the brain cut into dice (after having been well soaked, scalded,t and 
freed from the film), dipped into beaten yolk of egg, then into the finest 
crumbs mixed with salt, white pepper, a little giatid nutmeg, fine lemon- 
rind, and chopped parsley fried a fine brown, well drained and dried ; 
« and. as many egg-balls, the size of a small marble, as the volks of four 
eggs will supply. (See Chapter VI.) This quantity will be sufficient 
for two large tureens of soup ; when the whole is not wanted for table 

* When the butter is considered unobjectionable, the flour, without it, may be mixed 
to the amoothest batter powible, with a little cold, stock or water, and stirred briskly 
into the boiling soup : the apices should be blended with it. 

t The brain should be blanched, that is, thrown into boiling water with a little salt ia 
it, and boiled from five to eight minutes ; then lifted out, and laid into cold water for

Ibrm of small cakes, or it will not be done through bj the time it has 
taken enough colour: it may be altogether omitWd without much detri- 
ment to the soup, and will make an excellent corner dish, if gently 
stewed in white gravy tor half an hour, and served with it thicken^ 
with cream and arrow-root, to the consistency of good white sauce, then 
rather highly seasoned, and mixed with plenty of chopped parsley, and 
some lemon-juice. 

GOOD cAi-r's HEAD soDp ; (not expemive.) 

Boil down from six to seven pounds of the thick part of a shin of

of water, till reduced nearly hslf^ with the addition, when it first be- 

Ens to stew, of an ounce of salt, a large bunch of savoury herbs, one 
rge onion, a head of celery, three carrots, two or three turnips, two 
small blades of mace, eight or ten cloves, and a few white or black pep- 
percorns. Jj>t it boil gently, that it may not be too much reduced, lor 
six or seven hours, then strab it into a clean pan and set it by fbr use.

take off the scum, and throw in two glasses of sherry ; dish the Soup and 
slip into' the tureen some delicately med, and well dried forcemeat-balls 
made by the receipt Na 1, 2, or 3 of Chapter VI. A small quantity of 
lemon-juice or other acid can be added at pleasure. The wine and 
fbrceqaeat-balls may be omitted, and the other seasonings of the soup a 
little heightened. As much salt as may be required slK>uId be added to 
the stock when the head first begins to boil in it: the cook must regu- 
late also by the taste the exact proportion of cayenne, mace, and catsup, 
which wiU flavour the soup agreeably. The fragments of the head, 
with th<i bones and the residue of the beef used for stock, if stewed 
down together with some water and a few fresh vegetables, will affi)rd 
some excellent broth, such as would be highly acceptable, especially if 
well thickened with rice, to many a poor family during the winter 
months. 

Stock : shin of beef, 6 to 7 lbs. ; water, 5 quarts: stewed down (with 
vegetables, &c.) till reduced nearly half. Boned half-head with skin on 
etewed in stock, IJ hour. Soup: stock, 5 pints; ton^e, skin of head, 
and part of flesh : 15 to 40 minutes, or more if not quite tender. Rice- 
flour, 6 to 8 ozs. ; cayenne, quarter-teaspoonful ; mace, twice as much ;

wmTB OYSTER soup; {or, Oyster Soup a la Reine.) 

When the ovsters are small, from two to three dozens for each pint 
of soup should he prepared, but this number can, of course, be diminished 
or increased at pleasure. Let the fish (which should he finely condi- 
tioned natives) be opened carefiiUy ; pour the liquor firom them, and 
strain it; rinse them in it well, and beard them; strain the liquor a 
second time through a lawn-sieve or folded muslin, and pour it again 
over the oysters. Take a portion firom two quarts of the palest vea) 
stock, and simmer the beards in it fi*om twenty to thirty minutes. Heat 
the soup, flavour it well with mace and cayenne, and strain the stock 
from the oyster-beards into it Plump the fish in their own liquor, but 
do not let them boil ; pour the liquor to the soup, and add to it a pint of 
boiling cream ; put the oysters into the tureen, dish the soup, and send it 
to table quickly. Should any thickening be required, stir briskly to the 
stock an ounce and a half of arrow-root, ground very smooth in a mor- 
tar, and carefully mixed with a little milk or cream ; or, in lieu of this, 
when a rich soup is liked, thicken it with four ounces of fresh butter 
well blended with three of flour. 

Oysters, 8 to 12 dozens; pale veal stock, 2 quarts; cream, 1 pint, 
thickening, 1 J oz. arrow-root, or butter, 4 ozs., flour, 3 ozs. 

BBOWN RABBIT SOUP. 

Cut down into jomts, flour, and fry lightly, two fiiU grown, or three 
young rabbits ; add to them tiiree onions of moderate size, also fried to a 
clear brown; on these pour jp^radually seven pints of boiling water, 
throw in a large teaspoonful of salt, clear off all the scum with care as 
it rises, and then put to the soup a faggot of parsley, four not very large 
carrots, and a small teaspoonfiil of peppercorns ; boil the whole very 
9oh\y from five hours to five and a half; add more salt if needed, strain 
off the soup, let it cool sufficiently for the fiit to be skimmed clean from 
it, heat it afresh, and send it to table with sippets of fried bread. Spice,

unth a thickening of rice-floor, or of wbeaten floor browned in the oven, 
and mixed with a spoonfiil or two of very good mushroom catsap, or of 
Harvev's sauce, can be added at pleasure to the above, with a few drops 
of eschalot^wine, or vinegar; but the simple receipt will be found 
extremely good without t&m. 

Rabbits, 2 full grown, or 3 small; onions fried, 3, middlingnsized: 
water, 7 pints ; salt, 1 large teaspoonflil or more ; carrots, 4 ; fi^gpt ot 
parsley ; peppercorns, 1 small teaspoonful ; 5 to 5| hours. 

[pigeon 80UP. 

Take eight pigeons, cut down two of the oldest, and put them with 
the necks, pinions, livers, and gizzards of the others, into four quarts of 
water; let it boil till the substance is extracted, and strain it; season 
the pigeons with mixed spices and salt, and truss them as for stewine ; 
pick and wash clean a handful of parslejr, chives or young onions, and a 
good deal of spinach, chop them ; put in a frying-pan a quarter of a 
pound of butter, and when it boils, mix in a handful of bread crumbs, 
keep stirring them with a knife till of a fine brown ; boil the whole 
pigeons till they become tender in the soup, with the herbs, and fried 
bread. If the soup be not sufficiently high seasoned, add more mixed 
spices and salt] 

PHEASAirr OB CmCKEN SOUP. 

Half roast a brace of well-kept pheasants, and flour them rather 
thickly when they are first laid to the fire. As soon as they are nearly 
cold take all the flesh from the breasts, put it aside, and keep it covered 
from the air ; carve down the remainder of the birds into joints, bruise 
the bodies thoroughly, and stew the whole gently from two to three 
hours in five pints of strong beef broth ; then strain off the soup, and 
press as much of it as possible from the pheasants. Let it cool, and in 
the mean time strip the skin firom the breasts, mince them small, and 
pound them to the finest paste, with half as much fresh butter, and half 
of dry crumbs of bread ; season these well with cayenne, sufficiently 
with salt, and moderately with pounded mace, and grated nutmeg, and 
add, when their flavour is liked, three or four eschalots, previously boiled 
tender in a little of the soup, left till cold, and minced before they are 
put into the mortar; moisten the mixture with the yolks of two or three 
eggs, roll it into small balls of equal size, dust a littl^ flour upon them, 
skim all the &t from the soup, heat it in a clean stewpan, and when it 
boils throw them in and poach them from ten to twelve minutes, but 
first ascertain that the soup is properly seasoned with salt and cay- 
enne. Minced savoury herbs, and even grated lemon-rind, would, 
perhaps, improve the forcemeat, as well as a small portion of lean 
nam, a thick slice of which might be stewed in the soup for the pur- 
pose. We have recommended that the birds should bepartiall}r roasted 
neibre they are put into the soup-pot, because their flavour is much 
finer when this is done than when liiey are simply stewed ; they should 
be pkc^ rather near to a brisk fire that they be quickly browned on 
the surface, without losing any of their juices, and the basting should be 
constant A slight thickening of rice-flour or arrow-root can be added 
to the soup at pleasure, and the forcemeat-balls may be fried and slipped 
Into the tureen when they are preferred so. Haifa dozen eschalots 
lightly browned in butter, and a small head of celery may also be thrown 



CHAP. I.] aovPB. 03 

in after the birds begin to etew, but nothing should be allcmed to pre^ 
vail over the natural flavour of the game itself; and this should be 
observed equally with other kinds, as ];>artridge9, grouse, and venison. 

Pheasants 2 : roasted 20 to 30 minutes. Strong beef broth, or stock, 
5 pints : 2 to 3 hours. FQrcemeat>balls : breasts of pheasants, half as 
much of dry bread-crumbs and of butter, salt, mace, cayenne; yolks of 
2 or 3 eg& (and at choice 3 or 4 boiled eschalots). 

Obs, — -The stock may be made of six pounds of shin of bee^ and four 
quarts of water reduced to withm a pint of half An onion, a large car- 
rot, a bunch of savoury herbs, and some salt and spice should be added 
to it : one pound of neck of veal or <^ beef will improve it 

PAKTRIDOB SOUP. 

This is, we think, superior in flavour to the pheasant soup. It should 
be made in precisely uie same manner, but three birds allowed fer it 
instead of two. Grouse and partridges toother will make a still finer 
one : the remains of roast grouse even, added to a brace of partridges, 
will produce a very good eftfect 

MULLAOATAWNT SOUP. 

Slice, and fry gently in some good butter three or four large onions, 
and when they are ot a fine «qiial amber-colour, lift them out with a 
slice, and put them into a deep stewpot, or large thick saucepan ; throw 
a little more butter into the pan, and then brown lightly in it a younff 
rabbit, or the prime joints of two,vor a fowl cut down small, and floured. 
When the meat is sufficiently browned, lay it upon the onions, pour 
gradually to them a quart of good boiling stock, and stew it genUyfrom 
three quarters of an hour to an hour ; then take it out, and press the 
stock and onions through a fine sieve or strainer. Add to diem two 
pints and a half more of stock, pour the whole into a clean pan, and 
when it boils stir to it two heaped tablespoonsful of currie-powder mixed 
with nearly as much of browned flour, and a little cold water or broth ; 
put it in the meat, and simmer it for twenty minutes or longer should it 
not be perfectly tender, add the juice of a small lemon just before it is 
dished, serve it very hot, and send boiled rice to table with it. Part of 
a pickled mango is sometimes stewed in this soup, and is much recom- 
mended by persons who ha,ve been long resident in India. We have 
given here the sort of receipt commonly used in England for mullaga- 
tawny, but a much finer soup may be made by departing from it in 
some respects. The onions, of which the proportion may be increased 
or diminished to the taste, after being ftied slowly, and with care, that 
no part should be overdone, may be stewed for an hour in the first quart 
of stock with three or four ounces of grated cocoa-nut, which will im- 
part a rich mellow flavour to the whole. After all of this that can be 
rubbed through the sieve has been added to as much stock as will be 
required for tne soup, and the currie-powder and thickening have boiled 
in it for twenty minutes, the flesh of part of a calPs head previously 
stewed almost sufficiently, and cut as for mock turtle, with a sweet* 
bread also stewed or boiled in broth tolerably tender, and divided into 
inch-squares, will make an admirable mullagatawny, if simmered in the 
stock until they have taken the flavour of the currie-seasoning. The 
flesh of a couple of calves' feet, with a sweetbread or two, may, when 
more convenient, be substituted for the head. A large cupfiil of thick

eream, first mixed and boiled with a teaspoonful of flour or arrow-root 
to oreyent its curdling, and stirred into the soup before the lemon-juice, 
will enrich and improve it much. 

Rabbity 1, or the best joints of two, or foul, 1 ; large onions, 4 to 6 ; 
stock, 1 quart: | to 1 hour. 2^ pints more of stock ; currie-powder, 2 
heaped tablespoonsful, with 2 of browned flour; meat and all simmered 
together 20 minutes or more ; juice of lemon, 1 small ; or part of pickled 
mango stewed in the soup. 

Or,— onions, 3 to 6 ; cocoa-nut, 3 to 4 ozs. ; stock, 1 quart : stewed, 1 
hour. Stock, 3 pints, (in addition to the first quart) ; currie-powder and 
thickening each, 2 large tablespoonsfiil : 20 minute& Flesh of part of 
cairs head and sweetbread, 15 minutes, or more. Thick cream, 1 cup- 
fill ; flour, or arrow-root, 1 teaspoonful : boiled two minutes, and stirred 
to the soup. Chili vinegar, 1 tablespoonful, or lemon-juice, 2 table- 
spoonsful. 

Obs. 1. — ^The brain of the calf's head stewed for twenty minutes in 
a little of the stock, then rubbed through a sieve, diluted gradually with 
more of the stock, and added as thickening to the soup, will be found 
an admirable substitute for port of the flour. 

Ob$, 2. — Three or four pounds of a breast of veal, or an equal weight 
of mutton, free from bone and fat, may take the place of rabbits or fowls 
in this soup, for a plain dinner. The veal shoula be cut into squares of 
an inch and a hal( or into strips of an inch in width, and two in length ; 
and the mutton should be trimmed down in the same way, or into very 
small cutlets. 

Obs, 3.— For an elegant table, the joints of mbbit or of fowl should 
always be boned before they are added to the soup, for which, in this 
case, a couple of each will be needed for a single tureen, as all the in- 
ferior joints must be rejected. 

TO BOIL RICE FOR MULLAGATAWNY SOUPS, OR FOR CURRIES. 

The Patna, or small-grained rice, which is not so good as the Carolina 
for the general purposes of cookery, is the sort which ought to be served 
with currie. First take out the unhusked grains, then wash the rice in 
two or three different waters, and put it into a large quantity of cold ; 
bring it gently to boil, keeping it uncovered, and boil it softly for fifteen 
minutes, when it will be perfectly tender, and every ^in will remain 
distinct Throw it into a large cullender, and let it drain for ten minutes 
near the fire ; should it not then appear quite dry, turn it into a dish, 
and set it for a short time into a gentle oven, or let it steam in a clean 
saucepan near the fire. It should neither be stirred, except just at first, 
to prevent its lumping while it is still quite hard, nor touched with 
either fork or spoon ; the stewpan may be shaken occasionally, should the 
rice seem to require it, and it should be thrown lightly from the cullender 
upon the dish. A couple of minutes before it is done, throw in some salt, 
and from the time of its beginning to boil, remove the scum as it rises. 

Patna rice, ^ lb. ; cold water, 2 quarts : boiled eJowly, 15 minutes. 
Salt, 1 large teaspoonful. 

Obs, — ^This, of all the modes of boiling rice, which we have tried, 
and they have been very numerous, is indisputably the best The Caro* 
lina rice even answers, well dressed, in this way. One or two minutes, 
more or less, will, sometimes, from the varying quality of the grain, be 
requisite to render it tender. 



CHAP. 1.3 0O17Pfl. 55 

AHOTHSB RECEIPT FOR BoiUNo RICE ; {fiot 80 good 0$ the fteceSmg one,) 

Wash the rice thoroughly in several waters, and soak it for an hoar; 
drain and throw it into a large quantity of fast-boiling water. •Leave it 
uncovered, take off tiie scum, and add salt when it is nearly done. 
When it has boiled from fifteen to eighteen minutes, drain it well, heap 
it lightly in a dish, and place it in a gentle oven to dr^. 

Obs. — ^Rice is of far better flavour when cooked m so much water 
only as it will absorb; but it cannot then ^so easily be rendered dry 
enough to serve with currie, or with curried soups. One pint of rice, 
washed and soaked for a few minutes, then wiped very dr^, and dropped 
by degrees into five half pints of water, which should boil quickly, and 
continue to do so, while the rice is bein? added, and for a minute after* 
wards, and then placed over the fire, 3iat it may stew very softly for 
half an hour, or until it is tender, and as dry as it will become without 
being burned, will be found very good. The addition of a couple of 
ounces of fresh butter, when it is nearly done, will convert it into a very 
palatable dish of itselft 

^ AN EXCELLENT GREEN PEAS SOUP. 

Take at their fullest size, but before they are of bad colour or worm* 
eaten, three pints of fine large peas, and boil them as for table (see 
Chapter XY.) with half a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda in the water, 
that they may be very green. When they are quite tender, drain them 
well, and put them into a couple of quarts of boiling, pale, but good 
beef or veal stock, and stew them in it gently for half an hour, then 
work the whole through a fine hair-sieve ; put it into a clean pan and 
bring it to the point of boiling; add salt, should it be needed, and a 
smau teaspoonful of pounded sugar, clear off the scum entirely, and 
serve the soup as hot as possible, with small pale sippets of fried bread. 
An elegant variety of it is made by adding a half pmt more of stock to 
the peas, and about three quarters of a pint of asparagus points, boiled 
apart, and well drained before they are thrown into it, which should be 
done only the instant before it is sent to table : the fried bread will not 
then be needed. 

Green peas, 3 pints : boiled 25 to 30 minutes, or more. Veal or beef 
stock, 2 quarts (with peas :) ^ an hour. Sugar, one small teaspoonful ; 
salt, if needed. 

Obs. — ^When there is no stock at hand, four or five pounds of shin 
of beef, boiled slowly down with three quarts of water to two, and well 
seasoned with savoury herbs, young carrots, and onions, will serve in- 
stead quite well. A thick slice of lean, undressed ham would improve it. 

Should a common English peas soup be wished for, make it some- 
what thinner than the one above, and add to it, just be^re it is dished, 
from half to three quarters of a pint of young peas boiled tender, and 
well drained. 

GREEN PEAS SOVP, WITHOUT MEAT. 

Boil tender, in three quarts of water, with the proportions of salt and 
soda directed for them in Chapter XV., one quart of large, full grown 
peas ; drain and pound them in a mortar, mix with them gradually five 
pints of the liquor in which they were boiled, put the whole again over 
the fire, and stew it gently for a quarter of an hour; then press it 
through a hair-sieve. In the mean time, simmer, in from three to four 



56 MODERN COOKERY. [CHiLP |w 

ounces t£ butter,* three laive, or lour small cacnmbers, pared aod 
sliced, the hearts of three or four lettuces shred small, from one to &ur 
onions, according to the taste, cut thin, a few small sprigs of parsley, 
and, when the flavour is liked, a dozen leaves or more of mint, roughly 
chopped : keep these stirred over a gentle fire for nearly or quite an 
hour, and strew over them a hal^teaspoonful of salt, and a good season- 
ing of white pepper or cayenne. When they are partially done, drain 
them from the butter, put them into the strainea stock, and let the 
whde boil gently until all the butter has been thrown to the surface, 
and been entirely cleared from it; then throw in from half to three- 
quarters of a pint of young peas, boiled as for eating, and serve the soup 
immediately. 

When more convenient, the peas, with a portion of the liquor, may 
be pressed through a sieve, instead of being crushed in a mortar ; and 
when the colour of the soup is not so much a consideration as the fla- 
vour, they may be slowly stewed until perfectly tender in four ounces 
of good butter, instead of being boiled : a few green onions, and some 
branches of parsley may then be added to them. 

Green peas, 1 quart; water, 5 pints; cucumbers, 3 tc^; lettuces, 3 
or 4; onions, 1 to 4; little parsley; mint (if liked), 12 to 20 leaves; 
butter, 3 to 4 ozs. ; salt, half-teaspoonful ; seasoning of white pepper or 
cayenne : 50 to 60 minutes. Young peas, J to j of a pint 

Obs. — We must repeat that the peas for these soups must not be old^ 
as when they are so, their fine sweet flavour is entirely lost, and the 
dried ones would have almost as good an effect ; nor should they be of 
inferior kinds. Freshly gathered marrowfats, taken at nearly, or quite 
their full growth, will give the best quality of soup. We are credibly 
informed, but cannot assert it on our own authority, that it isoflen made 
for expensive tables in early spring, with the young tender plants or 
halms of the peas, when they are about a foot in height They are cut 
off close to the ground, like small salad, then boiled and preasea through 
a strainer, and mixed with the stock. The flavour is affirmed to be ex- 
cellent 

A CHEAP GREEN PEAS 80VP. 

Wash very clean, and throw into an equal quantity of boiling water, 
salted as for peas, three quarts of the shells, and in from twenty to 
thirty minutes, when they will be quite tender, turn the whole into a 
large strainer, and press tine pods strongly with a wooden spoon. Mea- 
sure the liquor, put two quarts of it into a clean, deep saucepan, and 
when it boils add to it a quart of full grown peas, two, or even three 
large cucumbers, as many moderate-sized lettuces freed from the coarser 
leaves, and cut small, one large onion (or more if liked,) sliced ex- 
tremely thin and stewed for half an hour in a morsel of butter before it 
is added to the soup, or gently fried without being allowed to brown ; a 
branch or two of parsley, and, when the flavour is liked, a dozen 
leaves of mint Stew these softly for an hour, with th6 addition of a 
small teaspoonful, or a larger quantity if required, of salt, and a good 
seasoning of fine white pepper, or of cayenne; then press the whole of 
the vegetables with the soup through a hair-sieve, heat it afresh, and 

*8ome peraong prefer the vegetables slowly fVied to a line broyrn, then drained on a 
sieve, and well dried before the fire ; 'but though more savoury so, they do not improve 
he colour of the soup. 



CRAP, f.3 SOUPS. 67 

send it to table with a dish of small fried sippets. The colour will not 
be so bright as that of the more expensive soups which precede it, but 
it will be excellent in flavour. 

Pea-shells, 3 quarts ; water, 3 quarts : 20 to 30 minutes. Liquor 
from these, 2 quarts ; fiill-sized green peas, 1 quart ; large cucumbers, 
2 or 3 ; lettuces, 3 ; onion, 1 (or more) ; little parsley ; mmt, 12 leaves ; 
seasoning of salt and pepper or cayenne : stewed 1 hour. 

Obs. — ^Tbe cucumbers should be pared, quartered, and freed from the 
seeds before they ore added to the soup. The peas, as we have said al« 
ready more than once, should not be old^ but taken at their full growth, 
before they lose their colour': the youngest of the shells ought to be se- 
lected for the liquor. 

RICH PKAS 8017P. 

Soak a quart of fine yellow split peas for a night, drain them well, 
and put them into a large soup-pot with five quarts of good brown gravy 
stock ; and when they have boiled ^ntly for lialf an hour, add to the soup 
three onions, as many carrots, and a turnip or two, all sliced and fried 
carefully in butter ; stew the whole softly till the peas are reduced to 
palp, then add as much salt and cayenne as may be needed to season it 
well, give it two or three minutes* boil, and pass it through a sieve, 
pressing the vegetables with it Put into a clean saucepan as much as 
may be requirS for table, add a little fresh stock to it should it be too 
thick, and reduce it by quick boiling if too thin; throw in the white 
part of some fresh celery sliced a quarter of an inch thick, and when 
this is tender send the soup quickly to table with a dish of small fried 
sippets. A dessertspoonful or more of currie-powder greatly improves 
peas soup : it should be smoothly mixed with a few spoonsful of it, and 
poured to the remainder when this first begins to boil after having been 
strained. 

Split peas, 1 quart : soaked one night Good brown gravy soup 5. 
quarts : 30 minutes. Onions and carrots browned in butter, 3 of each ; 
turnips, 2: 2^ to 3^ hours. Cayenne and salt as needed. Soup, 5 
pints ; celery sliced, 1 large or 2 small heads : 20 minutes. 

Obs. — When more convenient, six pounds of neck of beef well scored 
and equally, but carefully browned, may be boiled gently with the peas 
and fried vegetables in a gallon of water (which should be poured to 
them boiling) for four or five hours. 

COMMON PEAS SOUP. 

Wash well a quart of good split peas, and float off such as remain on 
the sur&ce of the water ; soak them for one night, and boil them with 
a bit of soda the size of a filbert in just sufficient water to allo\V them 
to break to a mash. Put them into from three to four quarts of good 
beef broth, and stew them in it gently for an hour ; then work the whole 
through a sieve, heat afresh as much as may be required for table, season 
it with salt and cayenne or common pepper, clear it perfectly from scum, 
and send it to table with fried or toasted bread. Celery sliced and 
stewedyin it as directed for the rich peas soup, will be found a great im 
provement to this. 

Peas, 1 quart : soaked 1 night ; boiled in two quarts or rather more 
of water, 2 to 2^ hours. Beef broth, 3 to 4 quarts : 1 hour. Salt and 
cayenne or pepper as needed : 3 minutes.

then add a couple of onions (more or less according to the taste), a 
couple of fine carrots mted, one lar^ or two moderate-sized turnips 
sliced, all gently fried brown in butter ; half a teaspoonful of black 
pepper, ana three times as much of salt Stew these softly, keeping 
them often stirred, until the vegetables are sufficiently tender to press 
through a sieve ; then rub the whole through one, put it into a clean 
pan, and when it boiTs throw in a sliced head of celery, heighten the 
seasoning if needful, and in twenty minutes serve the soup as hot as 
possible, with a dish of fried or toasted bread cut into dice. A little 
Chili vinegar can be added when liked : a larger proportion of vegeta- 
bles also may be boiled down with the peas at pleasure. Weak broth, 
or the liquor in which a joint has been boiled, can, when at hand, be 
substituted for water, but the soup is very palatable as we have given 
the receipt for it Some persons like it flavoured with a little mush*

OX-TAIL SOUP. 

An inexpensive and very nutritious soup may be made of ox-tails, 
but it will be insipid in flavour without the addition of a little ham, 
knuckle of bacon, or a pound or two of other meat Wash and soak 
three tails, pour on them a gallon of cold water, let them be brought 
gradually to boil, throw in an ounce and a half of salt, and clear off the 
scum carefully as soon as it forms upon the surface ; when it ceases to 
rise, add four moderate-sized carrots, from two to four onions, according 
to the taste, a large faggot of savoury herbs, a head of celery, a couple 
of turnips, six or eight cloves, and a half-teaspoonful of peppercorns. 
Stew these gfently from three hours to three and a half, if the tails be 
very large; lift them out, strain the liquor, and skim off all the fat; cut 
the meat ftom the tails (or serve them, if preferred, divided into joints), 
and put it into a couple of quartis or rather more of the stock ; stir in, 
when these begin to boil, a thickening of arrow-root or of rice-flour 
(see page 39), mixed with as much cayenne and salt as may be required 
to flavour the soup well, and serve it very hot If stewod down until 
(he flesh falls away from the bones, the ox-tails will make stock which 
will be quite a firm jelly when cold ; and this, strained, thickened, and 
well flavoured with spices, catsup, or a little wine, wovld, to many 
tastes, be a superior soup to the above. A richer one still may be macle 
by pouring good beef broth instead of water to the meat in the first 
instance.

A OREAP AND CKX>D 8TKW flOUP. 

Put from four to five pounds of the gristly part of the shin of beef 
into three quarts of cold water, and stew it very softly indeed, with the 
addition of the salt and vegetables directed for bouillon (see page 41), 
until the whole is very tender ; lift out the meat, strain the liquor, and 
put it into a large clean saucepan, add a thickening of rice-flour or 
arrow-root, pepper and salt if needed, and a tablespooa^l of mushroom 
catsup. In the mean time, cut all the meat into small, thick slices, add 
it to the soup, and serve it as soon as it is very hot The thickening 
and catsup may be omitted, and all the vegetables, pressed through a 
strainer, may be stirred into the soup instead, before the meat is put 
back into it 

SOUP IN HASTB. 

Chop tolerably fine a pound of lean bee^ mutton, or veal, and when 
it is partly done, add to it a small carrot and one small turnip, cut in 
slices, half an ounce of celery, the white part of a moderate-sized leek, 
or a quarter-ounce of onion. Mince all these together, and put the 
whole into a deep saucepan with three pints of cold water. When the 
soup boils, take off the scum, and add a little salt and pepper. In half 
an hour it will be ready to serve with or without straining : it may be 
flavoured at will, with cayenne, catsup, or aught else that is preferred. 
It may be converted into French spring broth) by passing it through a 
sieve, and boiling it again for five or six minutes with a handful of 
young and nicely-picked sorrel.

Obs, — ^Three pounds of beef or mutton, with two or three slices of 
ham, and vegetables in proportion to the above receipt, all chopped fine, 
and boiled in three quarts of water lor an hour and a half, will make 
an excellent fiimily soup on an emergency; additional boiling will of 
course improve it, and a little spice should be added after it has been 
skimmed, and salted. It may easilv be converted into carrot, turnip, 
or ground-rice soup after it is^trained. 

TEAL OR MUTTON BROTH. 

To each pound of meat add a quart of cold water, bring it gently to 
boil, skim it very clean, add salt in the same proportion as for bouillon 
(see page 41), with spices and vegetables also, unless unjlavoured broth 
be required, when a few peppercorns, a blade or two of mace, and a 
bunch of savoury herbs will be sufficient ; though for some purposes 
even these, with the exception of the salt, are better omitted. Simmer 
the broth for about four hours, unless the quantity be very small, when 
from two and a half to three will be sufficient A little rice boiled 
down with the meat will both thicken the broth and render it more nu- 
tritious. Strain it off when done, and let it stand till quite cold, that 
the &t may be entirely cleared fi:om it: this is especially needflil when 
it is to be served to an invalid.

and rendered the £sh oihr. In that state it is really erimpj oat con* 
tinues so only hr a very few hours ; and it bears therefore a much higher 
price in the London market then, than when mellowed by having been 
kept a day or two. 

The flesh of cod fish should be white and clear before it is boiled, whiter 
still after it is boiled, and firm though tender, sweet and mild in flavour, 
and separated easily into large flakes. Many persons consider it raUier 
improved than otherwise by having a little salt rub'bed along the inside cf 
of the back-bone and letting it lie from twenty-four to forty-eight hours 
before it is dressed. It is sometimes served crimp like salmon, and must 
then be sliced as soon as it is dead, or within the shortest possible time 
afterwards. 

Herrings, mackerel, and whitings, lose their fireshness so rapidly, 
that unless newly caught they are quite uneatable. The herring may, 
it is said, be deprived <^ the strong rank smell which it emits when 
broiled or fried, by stripping off the skin, under which lies the oil that 
causes the disagreeable odour. The whiting is a peculiarly pure flavoured 
and delicate fi^, and acceptable generally to invalids from being very 
light of digestion. 

Eels should be alive and brisk in movement when they are purchased, 
but the " horrid barbarity," as it is truly designated, of skinning anddivid« 
ing them while they are so, is without excuse, as they are easily destroyed  
** by piercing the spinal marrow close to the back part of the skull with a 
sharp pointed knife, or skewer. If this be done in the right place all motion 
will instantly cease.'* We quote Doctor Kitchener*s assertion on this sub- 
ject ; but we know that the mode of destruction which he recommends m 
commonly practised by the London fishmongers. Boiling water also 
will immediately cause vitality to cease, and is perhaps the most humane 
and ready method of destroying the fish. 

Lobsters, prawns, and shrimps are very stiff when freshly boiled, and 
the tails turn strongly inwards; when these relax, and the fish are 
soft and watery, they are stale ; and the smell will detect their being 
so instantly even if no other symptoms of it be remarked. If bought 
alive, lobsters should be chosen by their weight and '* liveliness." The 
hen lobster is preferred far sauce and soups, on account of the coral ; 
but the flesh of the male is generally considered of finer flavour for 
eating. The vivacity of their leaps will show when prawns and 
shrimps are fresh from the sea- 
Oysters should close forcibly on the knife when they are opened : if the 
shells are apart ever so little they are losing their condition, and when thev 
remain far open the fish are dead, and fit only to be thrown away. Small 
plump natives are very preferable to the larger and coarser kinds. 

TO CliEAIf FISH. 

Let this be done always with the most scrupulous nicety, for nothing 
can more effectually destroy the appetite, or disgrace the cook, than 
fish sent to table imperfectly cleaned. Handle it lightly, and never 
throw it roughly about, so as to bruise it; wash it well, but do not leave 
it longer in the water than is necessary, for fish, like meat, loses its 
flavour from being sraJied. When the scales are to be removed, lay 
the fish flat upon its side, and hold it firmly with the left hand, while 
they are scraped off with the right; turn it, and when both sides are 
done, pour or pomp sufficient water over to«float <^all the loose scale* ;

62 MODERN 000XER7. [CHAP. U. 

Ihen proceed to open and emptv it Be sure that not the slightest pap- 
ticle of offensive matter be leit in the inside ; wash out the blood en- 
tirely, and scrape or brush it away, if needful, from the back-bone. 
This may easily be accomplished, without opening the fish so much aa 
to render it unsightly when it is sent to table. The red mullet is 
dressed without being emptied, and smelts are drawn at the gills. 
When the scales are left on, the outside of the fish should be well 
washed and wiped with a coarse cloth, drawn gently fix>m the head to 
the tail. Eels, to be wholesome, should be skinned, but they are 
sometimes dressed without ; boiling water should then be poured upon 
them, and they should be left in it from five to ten minutes, before they 
are cut up. The dark skin of the sole must be stripped off when it is 
fried, but it must be left on, like that of a turbot, when the fish is 
boiled, and it should be dished with the white side upwards. Whitings 
are skinned, and dipped usually into e^g and bread-crumbs, when they 
are to be fried; but for boiling or broihng, the skin must be left on. 

TO KEEP FI8H. 

We find that all the smaller kinds of fish keep best if emptied and 
cleaned as soon as they are brought in, then wiped gently as dry as 
they can be, and hung separately by the head on the hooks m the ceil- 
inef of a cool larder, or in the open air when the weather will allow. 
When there is danger of their being attacked by flies, a wire safe, 
placed in a strong draught of air, is better adapted to the purpose. 
Soles in winter will remam good a couple of days when thus prepared; 
and even whitings and mackerel may be kept so without losing any 
of their excellence. Salt ma;^ be rubbed slightly over cod fish, and 
well along the back-bone, but it injures the flavour of salmon, the in- 
side of which may be rubbed with vi;iegar, and peppered instead. 
When excessive sultriness renders all of these modes unavailing, the 
fish must at once be partially cooked to preserve it, but this should be 
avoided if possible, as it is very rarely so good when this method is re- 
sorted to. 

TO filWEETEN TAINTED FISH. 

The application of the pyroligneous acid will ei^ct this when the 
taint is but slight. A wineglassful, mixed with two of water, may be 
poured over the fish, and rubbed upon the parts more particularly re- 
quiring it ; it must then be left for some minutes untouched, and aller- 
wards washed in several waters, and soaked until the smell of the acid 
is no longer perceptible. The chloride of soda, from its powerful anti- 
putrescent properties, will have more eflect when the fish is in a worse 
state. It should be applied in the same manner, and will not at all 
injure the flavour of the fish, which is not fit for food when it cannot 
be perfectly purified by either of these means. The chloride may be 
diluted more or less, as occasion may require. 

BRINE FOR BOILING FISH. 

Fish is exceedingly insipid if sufiicient salt be not mixed with the 
water in which it is boiled, but the precise quantity required for it will 
depend, in some measure, upon the kind of salt which is used. Fine 
common salt is that for which our directions are given ; but when the 
Maldon salt, which is very superior in strength, as well as in its other 
qualities, is substituted for^it, a smaller quantity must be allowed. 



CHAP, n.] FISH. 68 

Aboat four ounces to the gallon of water will be sufficient for small fish 
in general ; an additional ounce, or rather more, will not be too much 
for cod fish, lobsters, crabs, prawns, and shrimps; and salmon will re- 
quire eight ounces, as the brine for this fish should be strong: the water 
should always be perfectly well skimmed from the moment the scum 
begins to form upon the surface. 

Mackerel, whiting, and other small fish, 4 ozs. of salt to a gallon of 
water. Cod fish, lobsters, crabs, prawns, shrimps, 5 to 6 ozs. Salmon, 
6 ozs. 

TO RENDER BOILED FISH FIRM. 

Put a small bit of saltpetre with the salt into the water in which it 
is boiled : a quarter-ounce will be sufficient for a gallon. 

TO KEEP FISH HOT FOR TABLE. 

Never leave it in the water afler it is done ; but if it cannot be sent 
to table as soon as it is ready to serve, lift it out, lay the fish-plate into 
a large and very hot dish, and set it across the fish-kettle ; just dip a 
clean cloth into the boiling water, and spread it upon the fish ; place a 
tin cover over it, and let it remain so until two or three minutes before 
it is wanted, then remove the cloth, and put the fish back into the ket- 
tle for an instant that it may be as hot as possible ; drain, dish, and 
serve it immediately : the water should be kept boiling the whole time. 

TO BOIL A TURBOT. 

In season all the year. 

A fine turbot, in full season, and well served, is one of the roost deli- 
cate and delicious fish that can be sent to table ; but it is generally an 
expensive dish, and its excellence so much depends on the manner in 
which it is dressed, that great care should be taken to prepare it pro- 
perly. After it is emptied, wash the inside until it is perfectly cleansed, 
and rub lightly a little fine salt over the outside, as this will render less 
washing and handling necessary, by at once taking off the slime; 
change the water several times, and when the fish is as clean as it is 
possible to render it, draw a sharp knife through the thickest part of the 
middle of the back nearly through to the bone. Never cut off the fins 
of a turbot when preparing it for table, and remember that it is the 
dark side of the fish in which the incision is to be made, to prevent the 
skin of the white side from cracking. Dissolve in a well-cleaned tur- 
bot, or common fish-kettle, in as much cold spring water as will cover 
the fish abundantly, salt, in the proportion of four ounces to the gallon, 
and a morsel of saltpetre; wipe the fish-plate with a clean cloth, lay 
the turbot upon it with the white side upwards, place it in the kettle, 
bring it slowly to boil, and clear off the scum thoroughly as it rises. 
Let the water only just simmer until the fish is done, then lifl it out, 
drain, and slide it gently on to a very hot dish, with a hot napkin neatly 
arranged over the drainer. Send it immediately to table with rich 
lobster sauce, ^ood plain melted butter, and a dish of dressed cucumber. 
For a simple dmner, anchovy, or shrimp-sauce is sometimes served with 
a small turbot. Should there be any cracks in the skin of the fish, 
branches of curled parsley may be laid lightly over them, or part of the 
inside coral of the lobster, rubbed through a fine hair-sieve, may bo 
sprinkled over the fish ; but it is better without either, when it is very 
white, and unbroken. When gamishings are in favour, a slice or

lemon and a tuft of curled pard^ may be placed alternately round the 
edge of the dish. A border of fried smelts, or of fillets of soles, was 
formerly served, in general, round a turbo^ and is always a venr ad-, 
missible addition, though no lonc^er so fashionable as it wa& From 
fifteen to twenty minutes will boil a moderat&«ized fish, and from 
twenty to thirty a krge one ; but as the same time will not always be 
sufficient for a fish of the same weight, the cook must watch it atten- 
tively, and lift it out as soon as its appearance denotes its being done. 

ModenXe sized-turbot, 15 to 20 mmutes. Large, 20 to 30 minutes. 
Longer, if of unusual size. 

06«. — A lemon gently squeezed, and rubbed over the fish, is thought 
to preserve its whiteness. Some good cooks still put turbot into boiltng 
water, and to prevent its breaking, tie it with a cloth tightly to the fish- 
plate ; but cold water seems better adapted to it, as it is desirable that 
It should be gradually heated through before it begins to boiL 

TURBOT A LA CREMK. 

Raise carefully from thei)one8 the flesh of a cold turbot, and clear it 
from the dark skin ; cut it into small squares, and put it into an ex- 
ceedingly clean stewpan or saucepan ; then make and pour upon it the 
cream-sauce of Chapter IV., or make as much as may be required for 
the fish by the same receipt, with equal proportions of milk and cream, 
and a little additional flour. Heat the turbot slowly in the sauce, but 
do not allow it to boil, and send it very hot to table. The white skin 
of the fish is not usually added to this dish, and it is of better appear- 
ance without it ; but for a fiimily dinner, it may be left on the flesh, 
when it is much liked. No acid must be stirred to the sauce until* the 
whole is ready for table. 

[to broil salmon. 

This is a good method of dressing a small quantity of salmon for one 
or two pea-sons. It may be cut in slices the whole round of the fish, 
each taking in two divisions of the bone ; or the fish may be split, and 
the bone removed, and the sides of the fish divided into cutlets of three 
or four inches each : the former method is preferable, if done neatly 
with a sharp knife. Rub it thoroughly dry with a clean rough cloth ; 
then do each piece over with salad oil or butter. Have a nice clean 
gridiron over a very clear fire, and at some distance from it. When 
the bars are hot through wipe them, and rub with lard or suet to pre- 
vent sticking ; lay on Uie salmon, and sprinkle with salt. When one 
side is brown, carefully turn and brown the other. They do equally 
well or better in a tin or flat dish, in an oven, with a little bit of butter, 
or sweet oil ; or they may be done in buttered paper on the gridiron. 
Sauce, lobster or shrimp. 

TO bake salmon. 

If a small fish, turn the tail to the mouth, and skewer it; forcemeat 
may be ptit in the belly, or, if part of a large fish is to be Inked, cut it 
in slices, egg it over, and dip it in the forcemeat Stick bits of butter 
about the salmon (a few oysters laid round are an improvement) It 
will require occasional basting with the butter. When one side be- 
comes brown, let it be carefully turned, and when the second side is 
brown, it is done. Take it up carefully, with all that lies about it in 
the baking dish. For sauce, melted butter, with two tablespoonsful of 



^AP. 11.3 FI8H, tt 

port wine, one of catsap» and the juice of a lemon, poured over tfae fish , 
or anchovy sauce in a boat. 

PICKLE SALMON. 

Do not scrape off the scales, but clean the fish carefully, and cut into 
pieces about eight inches long. Make a strong brine of salt and water ; 
to two quarts, put two pounds of salt, and a quarter of a pint of vinegar ; 
in all, make just enough to cover the fish ; boil it slowly, and barely as 
much as you would lor eating hot Drain off all the liquor; and, when 
cold, lay the pieces in a kit or small tub. Pack it as close as possible, 
and fill up with equal parts of best vinegar and the liquor in which the 
fish was boiled. . Let it remain so a day or two, then again fill up. 
Serve with a garnish of fresh fennel. The same method of pickling 
will apply to sturgeon, mackerel, herrings, and sprats. The three lat- 
ter are sometimes baked in vineg^ar, flavoured with allspice and bay 
leaves, and eat very well ; but will not keep more than a few days.] 

TO BOIL SALMON. 
In full season firom May to August : may be had moeli earlier, but is scarce and dear. 

To preserve the fine colour of this fish, and to set the curd when it is 
quite freshly caught, it is usual to put it into boiling; instead of cold 
water. Scale, empty, and wash it with the greatest nicety, and be 
especially careful to cleanse all the blood from the inside. Stir into the 
fish-kettle eight ounces of common salt to the gallon of water, let it boil 
quickly for a minute or two, take off all the scum, put in the salmon 
and boil it moderately fast, if it be small, but more gently should it be 
very thick; and assure yourself that it is quite sufficiently done, before 
it is sent to table, for nothing can be more distasteful, even to the eye, 
than fish which is under dressed. 

From two to three pounds of the thick part of a fine salmon will 
require half an hour to boil it, but eight or ten pounds will be done 
enough in little more than double that time ; less, in proportion to its 
weight, should be allowed for a small fish, or for the thin end of a large 
one. Do not allow the salmon to remain in the water after it is ready 
to serve, or both its flavour and appearance will be injured. Dish it on 
a hot napkin, and send dressed cucumber, and anchovy, shrimp, or lob- 
ster sauce, and a tureen of plain melted butter to table with it. 

To each gallon of water, 8 ozs. salt Salmon, 2 to 3 lbs. (thick) 
^ hour : 8 to 10 lbs., 1^ hour: small, or thin fish, less time. ^ 

Obs, — A fashionable mode of serving salmon at the present day is to 
divide the larger portion of the body into three equal parts ; to boil 
them in water, or in a marinade ; and to serve them dished in a line, 
but not close together, and covered with a rich Genevese sauce ; it ap- 
pears to us that the sl^in should be stripped from any fish over which the 
sauce is poured, but in this case it is not customary. 

CRIMPED SALMON. ^ 

Cut into slices an inch and a halfj or two inches thick, the body of a 
salmon quite netoly caught ; throw them into strong salt and water as 
they are done, but do.not let them soak in it; wash them well, lay them 
on a fish-plate, and put them into fast-boiling water, salted, and well 
skimmed. In from ten to fifteen minutes they will be done. Dish 
them on a napkin, and send them very hot to table with lobster sauce, 
and plain melted butter ; or with the caper fish sauce of Chapter IV 
6*

SALMON A LA ST. MARCBL. 

Separate some cold boiled salmon into flakes, and free them entirely 
from the skin ; break the bones, and boil them in a pint of water fi>r 
half an hour. Strain off the liquor, put it into a clean saucepan and 
stir into it b)r degrees when it begins to boil quickly, two ounces of but- 
ter mixed with a large teaspoonml of flour, and when the whole has 
boiled for two or three minutes add a teaspoonflil of essence of ancho- 
vies, one of good mushroom catsup, half as much lemon-juice or Chili 
vinegar, a half teaspoonful of pounded mace, some cavenne, and a very 
little salt Heat the fish veiy slowly in the sauce by the side of the 
fire, but do not allow it to boil. When it is very hot, dish, and send it 
quickly to table. French cooks, when they re-dress fish or meat of any 
kind, prepare the fiesh with great nicety, and then put it into a stew- 
pan, and pour the sauce upon it, which is, we think, better than the 
more nsual English mode of laying it into the boilin? sauce. The cold 
salmon may also be re-heated m uie cream, sauce of Chapter IV. or in 
the Miiitre d*Hotel sauce which follows it; and will be finind excellent 
with either. This receipt is for a moderate sized dish. 

Obs. — We reCTet that we cannot give insertion to a larger number 
of receipts for dressing this truly excellent fish, which answers for 
almost every mode of cookery. It may be fided in cutlets, broiled, 
baked, roasted, or stewed ; served in a common, or in a raised pie, or in 
a potato-pastv ; in a salad, in jelly ; collared, smoked, or pickled ; and 
will be found good prepared by any of these processea A rather full 
seasoning of savoury herbs is thought to correct the e&ct of the natu- 
ral richness of the salmon. For directions to broil, bake, or roast it, the 
reader is referred to Chapter VII. 

TO BOIL COD FISH. 

In highest season from October to the beginning of Febraary ; in perfection abonK 

Christmas. 

When this fish is large, the head and shoulders are sufficient tor a 
handsome dish, and they contain all the choicer portion of it, though not 
so much substantial eating, as the middle of the body, which, in conse- 
.quence, is generally preferred to them by the frugal housekeeper. 
Wash the fish, and cleanse the inside, and the back-bone in particular, 
with the most scrupulous care ; lay it into the fish kettle and cover it 
well with cold water mixed with five ounces of salt to the gallon, and 
about a quarter ounce of saltpetre to the whole. Place it over a mod^* 
rate fire, clear off the scum perfectly, and let the fish boil gently until 
it is done. Drain it well* and dish it carefiiUy upon a very hot napkin 
with the liver and the roe as a gamiBh. To these are usually added 
tuAs of lightly scraped horse-raddish round the edge. Serve well made 
oyster sauce and plain melted butter with it; or anchovy sauce when 
oysters cannot be procured. The cream sauce of Chapter IV. is also an 
appropriate one for this fish.

Cut the middle or tail of the fish into slices nearir an inch thick, sea- 
son them with salt and white pepper or cayenne, nour them well, and 
fry them of a clear equal brown on both sides; drain them on a sieTO 
before the fire, and serve them on a well-heated napkin, with plenty of 
crisped parsley round them. Or, dip them into beaten egg, and then 
into fine crumbs mixed with a seasoning of salt and pepper (some cooki 
add one of minced herbs also,) before they are fried. Send melted but> 
ter and anchovy sauce to table with them. 

8 to 12 minutes. 

Obs, — ^This is a much better way of dressing the thin part of the fish 
than boiling it, and as it is generally cheap, it makes thus an economic 
ca^, as well as a very good dish : if the slices are lifted from the fryingw 
pan into a good curried gravy, and left in it by the side of the fire for a 
few minutes before they are sent to table, they will be found excellent 

STEWED OOD. 

Put into boiling water, salted as usual, about three pounds of firesh 
cod fish cut into slices an inch and a half thick, and boil them eently 
for five minutes ; lift them out, and let them drain. Have ready-heated 
in a wide stewpan nearly a pint of veal gravy or of very eood broth, lay 
in the fish, and stew it for five minutes, then add four taUespoonsful of 
extremely fine bread-crumbs, and simmer it for three minutes longer. 
Stir well into the sauce a large teaspoonful of arrow-mot, quite free 
firom lumps, a fourth part as much of mace, something less of cayenne, 
and a tablespoonful of essence of anchovies, mixed with a fflass of white 
wine and a dessertspoonful of lemon Juice. Boil the whde for a cou- 
ple of minutes, lift out the fish caremlly with a slice, pour the sauce 
over, and serve it quiclfly. 

Cod fish, 3 lbs. : boiled 5 minutes. Gravy, or strong broth, nearly I 
pint: 5 minutes. Bread-crumbs, 4 tablespocxisful : 3 minutes. Arrow* 
root, 1 large teaspoonful ; mace, ^ teaspoonfiil ; less of cayenne ; es- 
sence of anchovies, 1 tablespoonfiil ; lemon-juice, 1 dessertspoonfiil ; 
sherry or Madeira, 1 wineglassful : 2 minutes. 

Obs. — ^A dozen or two of oysters, bearded, and added with their 
strained liquor to this dish two or three minutes before it is served, will| 
to many tastes, vary it very agreeably. 

STEWED OOD FISH, IN BROWN SAUCE. 

Slice the fish, take ofif the skin, flour it well, and fry it quickly a fine 
brown ; lift it out and drain it on the back of a sieve, arrange it in a 
clean stewpan, and pour in as much good brown gravy, boiling, as will 
nearly cover it ; add from one to two glasses of port wine, or rather 
more of claret, a dessertspoonful of ChQi vinegar, or the juice of half 
a lemon, and some cayenne, with as much salt as may be needed. Stew 
the fish very softly until it just begins to break, lift it carefully with a 
slice into a very hot dish, stir into the gravy an ounce and a half of but- 
ter, smoothly beaded with a large teaspoonful of flour, and a little 
pounded mace, give the sauce a minute's boil, pour it over the fish, and 
serve it immediately. The wine may be omitted, good shin of beef 
stock substituted for the gravy, and a teaspoonful of soy, one of essence 
of anchovies, and two tablespoonsfiil of Harvey's sauce added to flac 
vour it

TO BOIL sAur rum. 

When very salt and dry, this must be long-soaked before it is boiled, 
but it is generally supplied by the fishmongers nearly or quite ready to 
dress. When it is not so, lay it for a night into a large quantity of cold 
water, then let it lie exposed to the air for some time, then again put it 
into water, and continue thus until it is well softened. Brush it very 
clean, wash it thoroughly, and put it with abundance of cold water into 
the fish kettle, place it near the fire and let it heat very slowly indeed. 
Keep it just on the point of simmering, without allowing it ever to boil 
(which would render it hard), from three quarters of an hour to a full 
hour, according to its weight; should it be quite small and thin, less 
time will be sufficient for it ; but by following these directions, the fish 
will be almost as good as if it were firesh. The scum should be cleared 
off with great care from the beginning. Egg sauce and boiled parsneps 
are the usual accompaniments to salt fish, which should be dished upoa 
a hot napkin, and which is sometimes also thickly strewed with chop- 
ped eggs. 

SALT FI8H ; (a la Mditre tT Hotel.) 

Boil the fish by the foregoing receipt, or take the remains of that 
which has been served at table, flake it off clear from the bones, and 
strip away every morsel of the skin ; then lay it into a very clean 
saucepan or stewpan, and pour upon it the sharp Mftitre d'Hotel sauce 
of Chapter IV. ; or, dissolve gently two or three ounces of butter with 
fbur or five spoonsfiil of water, and a half-teaspoonfiil of flour ; add 
some pepper or cayenne, very little salt, and a dessertspoonfiil or more of 
minccKi parsley. Heat the fish slowly quite through in either of these 
sauces, and toss or stir it until the whole is welj mixed ; if the second 
be used, add the juice of half a lemon, or a small quantity of Chili vin- 
egar, just before it is taken irom the fire. The fish thus prepared may 
be served in a deep dish, with a border of mashed parsneps or potatoes. 

TO BOIL CODS SOUNDS. 

Should they be highly salted, soak them for a night, and on the fol- 
lowing day, rub off entirely the discoloured skin ; wash them well, lay 
them into plenty of cold milk and water, and boil them gently from 
thirty to forty minutes, or longer, should they not be quite tender. Clear 
off the scum as it rises w^ith great care, or it will sink, and adhere to 
the sounds, of which the appearance will then be spoiled. Drain them 
well, dish them on a napkin, and send'egg sauce and plain melted but* 
ter to table with them. 

TO ittY cods' sounds IN BATTER. 

Boil them as directed above, until they are nearly done, then lift them 
out, lay them on to a drainer, and let them remain till they are cold ; 
cut them across in strips of an inch deep, curl them round, dip them 
into a good French or English batter, fry them of a fine pale brown, 
drain and dry them well, dish them on a hot napkin, and garnish them 
with crisped parsley. 

[to make chowder. 

Lay some slices cut from the fat part of pork in a deep stew-pan, mix 
sliced onions with a variety of sweet herbs, and lay them on the pork ; 
boue and cut a fresh cod into thin^slices, and place them on the pork, 



CHAP. II.] FISH. 60 

then pat a layer of pork, on that a layer of biscuit then alternately the 
other materials until the pan is nearly full, season with pepper and salt, 
put in about a quart of water, cover the stew-pan very close, and let it 
stand, with fire above as well as below, for four hours ; then skim it 
well, and it is done. 

TO BOIL BOCK-FISH, BLACK-FISH, AND 8EA-BAJSS. 

Clean the fish with scrupukxis care, particularly the back-bone, then 
lay the fish into the fish-kettle and cover it with cold water, strewing 
in a handful of salt (and a small pinch of saltpetre, if you have it), and 
place it over a moderate fire. Clean off the scum carefully, and let it 
boil very gently till it is done ; then drain it, as directed for cod-fish, 
and dish it nicely — garnished with hard-boiled e^gs, cut in halves. 
Celery sauce, or anchovy sauce, is the proper kind for these fish, or 
plain melted butter. 

TO BOIL HALIBUT. 

Take a small halibut, or what you require fix)m a large fish. Put it 
into the fish-kettle, with the back of the fish undermost, cover it with 
cold water, in which a handful of salt and a bit of saltpetre, the size of 
a hazle-nut, have been dissolved. When it begins to boil skim it care- 
fiilly, and then let it just simmer till it is done. Four pounds of fish 
will require half an hour, nearly, to boil it Drain it garnish with 
horse-radi^ or parsley — egg sauce, or plain melted butter, are served 
with it] 

FILLETS OF HALIBUT, BLACK-FISH, &C. 

The war^JiUet, whether applied to fish, poultry, game, or butcher's 
meat means simply the fiesh of either (or of certain portions of it), 
raised clear fix>m the bones in a handsome form, and divided or not ss 
the manner in which it is to be served may require. It is an elegant 
mode of dressing various kinds of fish, and even those which are not 
the most highly esteemed, affiird an excellent dish when thus prepared. 
The fish, to be filletted with advantage, should be large ; the flesh may 
then be divided down the middle of we back, next separated from the 
fins, and with a very sharp knife raised clean from the bones.'*' When 
thus prepared, the fillets may be divided, trimmed into a good form^ 
egged, covered with fine crumbs, fried in the usual way, and served 
with the same sauces as the whole fish ; or each fillet may be rolled up, 
in its entire length, if very small, or after being once divided, if large, 
and fiistened with a slight twine, or a short thin skewer ; then egged, 
crumbed, and fiied in plenty of boiling lard ; or merely well floured and 
firied from eight to ten minutes. When the fish are not very large, 
they are sometimes boned without being parted in the middle, and each 
side is rolled from the tail to tlie head, after being first spread with but- 
ter, a few bread-crumbs, and a hi^h seasoning of mace and cayenne ; 
or with pounded lobster mixed with a large portion of the coral, and 
the same seasoning, and proportion of butter; then laid into a dish, well 
covered with crumbs of bread and clarified butter, and baked from 
twelve to sixteen minutes, or untH the crumbs are coloured to a fine 
brown in a moderate oven. 

* A celebrated French cook gives the following instructions for raising the^e fillets: 
—••Take them up by running your knife first between the bones and the fiesh, then 
between the skin and the fillet ; by leaning pretty hard oa the table they wil 'eome off 
very neatly." 



*^ MODERN COOKERY. [CHA». II. 

The fillets may likewise be cut into small strips or squares of unifbrm 
size, lightly dreoged with pepper or cayenne, salt and flour, and fried 
in butter over a brisk lire ; then well drained, and sauced with a good 
bechamel, flavoured with a teaspoonful of minced parsley. 

BAKED SOLES, HALIBUT AND CARP. 

Clarify from two to three ounces of fresh butter, and pour it into the 
dish in which the fish are to be served ; add to it a little salt, some 
cayenne, a teaspoonfiil of essence of anchovies, and fit>m one to two 
glasses of sherry, or of any other dry white wine ; lay in a couple of 
fine soles which have been well cleaned and wiped very dry, strew over 
them a thick la^er of fine bread-crumbs, moisten them with clarified 
butter, set the dish into a moderate oven, and bake the fish a quarter of 
an hour; we would recommend a little lemon-juice to be mixed with 
the sauce. 

Baked 15 minutes. 

Obs. — The fish are, we think, better without the wine in this receipt. 
They require but a small portion of liquid, which might be supplied bj 
a little additional butter, a spoonful of water or pale gravy, the lemon- 
juice, and store-sauce. Minced parsley may be miz^ with the bread* 
crumbs when it is liked. 

SOLES OR CARP STEWED IN CREAM. 

Prepare some very fi-esh middling sized fish with exceeding nicety, 
put them into boiling water slig^htly salted, and simmer them for two 
minutes only ; lifl them out, ana let them drain ; lay them into a wide 
Btewpan with as much sweet rich cream as will nearly cover them ; 
add a good seasoning of pounded mace, cayenne and salt ; stew the fish 
softly from six to ten minutes, or until the flesh parts readily from the 
bones ; dish them, stir the juice of half a lemon to the sauce, pour it 
over the soles, and send them immediately to table. Some lemon-rind 
may be boiled in the cream, if approved ; and a small teaspoonfiil of 
arrow-root, very smoothly mixed with a little milk, may be stirred to 
the sauce (should it require thickening) before the lemon-juice is added. 
Turbot and brill also may be dressed by this receipt, jtime, proportioned 
to their size, being of course allowed for them. 

Soles, 3 or 4 : coiled in water 2 minutes. Cream, ^ to whole pint ; 
salt, mace, cayenne : fish stewed, 6 to 10 minutes. Juice of half a 
lemon. 

[to boil STrROEON. 

Take off the skin, which is very rich and oily ; cut in slices ; season 
with pepper and salt ; broil over a clear fire ; rub over each slice a bit 
of butter, and serve with no other accompaniment than lemon ; or the 
slices may be dipped in seasoning or forcemeat, twisted in buttered 
white paper, and so broiled. For sauce, serve melted butter with catsup. 
Garnish with sliced lemon, as the juice is generally used with the fish. 

TO ROAST STURGEON. 

A piece of sturgeon may be tied securely on a spit, and roasted. 
Keep it constantly basted with butter, and when nearly done dredge 
with bread crumbs. When the flakes begin to separate, it is done. It 
will take about half an hour before a brisk fire. Serve with good gravy, 
thickened with butter and flour, and enriched with an anchovy, a gla£S3 
of sherry wine, and the juice of half a Seville orange or lemon. 



CHAP, n.] FISH. 71 

TO 8TEW snmoBON. 

Take enough gravy to cover the fish ; set it on with a tablespoonful 
of salt, a few corns of black pepper, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion 
or two, scraped horse-radish, ana a glass of vinegar. Let this boil a 
few minutes ; then set it aside Jto tecome pretty cool ; then add the 
fish ; let it come gradually to boil ; and then stew gently till the fish 
begins to break. Pake it off immediately ; keep the fish warm ; strain 
the gravy, and thicken with' a good piece of butter ; add a glass of port 
or sherry wine, a grate of nutmeg, and a little lemon juice. Simmer till 
it thickens, and then pour over the fish. Sauce, anchovy. 

TO VRT erUROEOlf. 

Cut the fish into rather thin slices ; sprinkle it well with salt on both 
sides; when the salt has drawn out all the moisture of the fish, roll it 
in bread crumbs and egg, and fry it in hot lard. When done, take it 
out and put a glass of water, a spoonful of vinegar, and a little lemon- 
peel into the pan, give it a boil, cup and strain it over the fish.] 

TO BOIL WBTmiofi ; (^French Receipt.) 
Having scraped, cleaned, and wiped them, lay them on a fishplate, 
and put them into water at the point of boiling; throw in a handful of 
salt, two bay leaves, and plenty of parsley, well washed, and tied to- 
gether ; let the fish just simmer from five to ten minutes, and watch 
them closely tiiat they may not be over-done. Serve parsley and but- 
ter with them, and use in making it the liquor in which the whitings 
have been boiled. 

Just simmered fix)m 5 to 10 minutes. 

BAKED WHTTINOS A LA FRANCAISE. 

Proceed with these exactly as with baked soles, page 70, or, pour a 
little clarified butter into a deep dish, and strew it rather thickly with 
finely-minced mushrooms, mixed with a teaspoonful of parsley, and 
(when the flavour is liked, and considered appropriate) with an escha- 
lot or two, or the white part of a few green onions, also chopped very 
small. On these place the fish, after they have been scaled, emptied, 
thoroughly washed, and wiped dry : season them well with salt, and 
white pepper, or cayenne; sprinkle more of the herbs upon them ; pour 
gently from one to two glasses of light white wine into the dish, cover 
the whitings with a thick layer of fine crumbs of bread, sprinkle these 
plentifiilly with clarified butter, and bake the fish from fifteen to twenty 
minutes. Send a cut lemon only to table with them. When the wine 
is not liked, a few spoonsful of pale veal gravy can be used instead ; or 
a larger quantity of clarified butter, with a tablespoonful of water, a 
teaspoonful of lemon-pickle and of mushroom catsup, and a few drops 

of soy. 
15 to 20 minutes. 

TO BOIL MACKEREL. 

In full Beaion in May, June, and July ; may be had also in early spring. 
Open the fish sufficiently to admit of the insides being perfectly 
deansed^ but not more than is necessary for this purpose ; empty them 
with care, lay the roes apart, and wash both them and the mackerel 
delicately clean. It is customary now to lay these, and the greater 
number of other fish as well, into cold water when they are to be boiled ; 
formerly all were plunged at once into fastrboiling water. For such aa 



72 MODERK COOKERY. [cHAP. n. 

are Bmall wad delicate, it shoold be warm, but not scalding ; they should 
be brought ffently to a soft boil, and ammered until they are done; the 
scum should be cleared c^ as it rises, and the usual proportion of salt 
stirred into the water before the mackerel are put in. The roes are 
commonly replaced in the fish, but as they sometimes require more 
boiling than the mackerel themselves, it is better, when they are very 
large, to lay them upon the drainer l^ their side& From fifteen to 
twenty minutes will generally be suflficient to boil a fiill-eized macke- 
rel : some will be done in less time, but they must be watched, and 
Utled out as soon as the tails split, and the ejes are starting. 

Dish them on a napkin, and send fennel or gooseberry sauce to table 
with them, and plain melted butter alsa 

Small mackerel, 10 to 15 minutes ; large, 15 to 30 minutes. 

TO SAKE MACKEREL. 

After they have been cleaned and well washed, wipe them very dry, 
fill the insides with the forcemeat, No. 1 of Chapter VL, sew them na 
arrange them, with the roes, closely together in a coarse baking-dish, 
flour Uiem lightly, strew a little fine salt over, and stick bits of Dutter 
upon them ; or pour some equally over them, after having just dissolved 
it in a small saucepan. Half an hour in a moderate oven will bake 
them. Oyster forcemeat is always ai^ropriate for anv kind of fish 
which is in season, while' the oysters are so, but the mackerel are com- 
monly served, and are very good with that which we have named. 
Lift them carefully into a hot dish after they are taken from the oven, 
and send melted butter, and the sauce cruets to taUe with them. 

^ hour. 

Obs. — ^The dish in which they are baked should be buttered before 
they are laid in. 

FRIED mackerel; (commoTi French receipt^ 

After the fish have been emptied and washed extremely clean, cut 
off the heads and tails, split the bodies quite open, and take out the 
backbones ;* wipe the mackerel very dry, dust fine salt, and pepper (or 
cayenne), over them» flour them well, fry them a fine brown in boiling 
lard, drain them thoroughly, and serve them with the following sauce : 
Dissolve in a small saucepan an ounce and a half of butter smoothly 
mixed with a tcaspoonful of flour, some salt, pepper, and cayenne, shake 
these over a gentle fire until they are lightly coloured, then add by 
slow degrees nearly half a pint of good broth, or gravy, and tlie juice 
of one large lemon : boil the sauce for a couple of minutes, and serve 
it very hot Or, instead of this, add a large teaspoonful of strong-made 
mustard, and a dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar, to some thick melted 
butter, and serve it with the fish. A spoonful of Harvey's sauce, or ^ 
mushroom catsup, can be mixed with this last, at pleasure. 

FILLETS OF MACKEREL ; (JHed OT broUed,) 

Take off the flesh quite whole on either side, ftom three fine macke- 
rel, which have been opened and properly cleaned ; let it be entirely 
free from bone, dry it well in a cloth, then divide each part in two, and 
dip them into the beaten yolks of a couple of eggs, seasoned with salt 

* We recoimnend in preference ibat tbe flesb of the ilsli should be taken off tbe 
bones as in Uie following receipt. ^ 



CHAP. U.] FISH. 73 

and white pepper or cayenne ; cover them equally with fine dry cmmbs 
of l»:ead, and fry them like soles ; or dip them into CAarified batter, and 
then again into the crumbs, and broil them over a very clear fire of a 
fine brown. Dish them in a circle one over the other, and send them 
to table with the M^itre d'Hotel sauce of Chapter IV., or with the one 
which follows it The French pour the sauce into the centre of the 
dish ; but for broiled fillets this is not so well, we think, as serving it in 
a tureen. The roes of ttie fish, after being well washed and soaked, 
may be dressed with them, or they may be made into patties. Minced 
parsley can be mixed with the bread-crumbs when it is liked. 

BOILED FILLETS OF M^CEEBEL. 

After having taken off and divided the flesh of the fish, as above, 
place it fiat in one layer in a wide stewpan or saucepan, and just cover 
the fillets with cold water ; throw in a teaspoonful of salt, and two or 
three small sprigs of paroley. Bring the mackerel sk>wly to a boi]» 
clear c^ tlie scum with care, and after two or three minutes of slow 
simmering, try the fillets with a £>rk ; if the thick part divides with a 
touch, they are done. Lift them out cautiously with a slice ; drain, and 
serve them very hot with good parsley and butter ; or strip off the 
skin quickly, and pour a MMtre d^Hotel sauce over them. 

MACKEREL BROILED WHOLE ; {an excellent receipt,') 

Emptyj and cleanse perfectly a fine and very fresh mackerel, but 
without opening it more than is needful ; dry it well, either in a cloth, 
or by hang[ing it in a cool air until it is stifi^; make, with a sharp knife, 
a deep incision the whole length of the fish, on either side of the back- 
bone, and about half an inch ftom it, and with a feather put in a little 
cayenne and fine salt, mixed with a few drops of good salad oil or cla- 
rified butter. Lay the mackerel over a moderate fire upon a well 
heated gridiron, which has been rubbed with suet; loosen it gently 
should it stick, which it will do unless often moved ; and when it is 
equally done on both sides, turn the back to the fire. About half an 
hour will broil it well. If a sheet of thickly-buttered writing-paper be 
folded round it, and just twisted at the ends before it is laid on the grid- 
iron, it will be finer eating than if exposed to the fire ; but sometimes 
when this is done, the skin will adhere to the paper, and be drawn off 
with it, which injures its appearance. A cold M&itre d'Hotel 'sauce 
(see Chapter IV.), may be put into the back before it is sent to table* 
This is one of the very best modes of dressing a mackerel, which in 
flavour is quite a different fish when thus prepared to one which is 
simply boiled. A drop of oil is sometimes passed over the skin to pre- 
vent its sticking to the iron. It may be laid to the fire after having 
been merely cut as we have directed, when it is preferred so. 

30 minutes ; 25 if smalL 

MACKEREL STEWED WITH WINE; (vCry gOod,) 

Work very smoothly together a large teaspoonful of flour with two 
ounces of butter, put them into a stewpan, and stir or shake them round 
over the fire until the butter is dissolved ; add a quarter-teaspoonful of 
mace, twice as much salt, and some cayenne ; pour in by slow degrees 
three glasses of claret, and when the sauce boils, lay in a couple o? fine 
mackerel, well cleaned, and wiped quite dry ; stew them very softly 
7 



74 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP. II. 

from fifteen to twenty minutes, and turn them when half done ; lift 
them out, and dish them carefully ; stir a teaspoonful of made-mustard 
to the sauce, give it a boil, and pour it over the fish. When more con- 
venient, substitute port wine and a little lemon-juice, for the claret. 

Mivckerel, 2 ; flour, 1 teaspoonful ; butter, 2 ozs. ; seasoning of salt, 
mace, and cayenne; claret, 3 glassesful; made-mustard, 1 teaspoonful: 
15 to 20 minutes. 

FILLETS OF MACKEREL STEWED IN WINE; (eXCClletU,) 

Raise the flesh entire from the bones on either side of the mackerel, 
and divide it once, if the fish be small, but cut the whole into six parts 
of equal size should they be large. Mix with flour, and dissolve the 
butter ks in the preceding receipt, and when it has simmered for a 
minute throw in the spice, a littfe salt, and the thinly pared rind of 
half a small fresh lemon ; lay in the fillets of fish, shake them over a 
gentle fire from four to five minutes, and turn them once in the time ; 
flien pour to them in small portions a couple of large glassesful of port 
wine, a tablespoonful of Harvey's sauce, should it be at hand, a tea- 
spoonful of soy, and one of lemon-juice ; stew the mackerel very softly 
until the thinner parts begin to break, lift them out with care, dish ai^ 
serve them in their sauce as hot as possible. We can recommend the 
dish to our readers as a very excellent one. A garnish of fried sippets 
can be placed round the fish at will. A teaspoonful of made-mustard 
should be stirred to the sauce before it is poured over the fish. 

Mackerel, 2 ; butter, 2 oza ; flour, 1 teaspoonful ; rind of i lemon ; 
salt, cayenne, pounded mace : 2 minutes. Fish, 4 to 5 minutes. Port 
wine, 2 large glassesful; Harvey's sauce, 1 tablespoonful; soy and 
lemon-juice each, 1 teaspoonful : 4 to 6 minutes. Mustard, 1 teaspoonfiiL 

Obs, — ^Trout may be dressed by this receipt 

TO BOIL HADDOCKS. 
In the best season in October, November, and December. 

Scrape the outsides very clean, open the fish, empty them, wash the 
insides thoroughly, take out the gills, curl the haddocks round, fasten 
the taih to the mouths, arrange them on a fish-plate, and lay them into 
warm water salted as for mackerel, with a very small bit of saltpetre to 
render them firm. Skim the water, and simmer them from seven to 
ten minutes, according to their size. Send them very hot to table, with 
a tureen of^ melted butter, and one of anchovy sauce. 

7 to 10 minutes. 

BAKED HADDOCKS. 

After they have been cleaned, dry them thoroughly, then bake them, 
as directed in the common receipt for pike, or fill them with oyster- 
forcemeat, or with No. 1 of Chapter IV., if more convenient, and pro- 
ceed as for baked mackerel. 

20 to 30 minutes ; longer if very large. 

TO BOIL PLAICE OR FLOUNDERS. 

Plaice in season from May to January; flounders in September, October, and No- 
vember. 

Afler having emptied and well cleaned the fish, make an incision in 
the back as directed for turbot ; lay them into cold spring water ; add 
salt, and saltnetre in the saipe proportion as for cod fish, and let them 



CHAP. II.3 FISH. -75 

ju8t simmer fi>r four or five minutes after the water first begins to boil, 
or longer, should their size require it, but guard against their being 
broken. Serve them with plain melted butter. 
4 to 5 minutes: longer if needful. 

TO FRY PLAICE OK FLOUNDSES. 

Sprinkle them with salt, and let them lie for two or three hours be- 
fore they are dressed. Wash and clean them thoroughly, wipe them 
very dry, flour them well, and wipe them again with a clean cloth ; dip 
them into ege, and fine bread-crumbs, and firy them in plenty of larcL 
[f the fish be large, raise the flesh in handsome fillets from the bones, 
and finish them as directed for fillets of soles. 

Obs. — Plaice is said to be rendered less watery by beating it gently 
with a paste-roller before it is cooked. It is very sweet and pleasant in 
flavour while it is in the best season, which is from the end of May to 
about September. 

TO BOAST, BAKE, OR BROIL RED MULLET. 
In best season through the summer : may be had all the year. 

First wa^, and then dry the fish thoroughly in a cloth, but neither 
ficale nor open it; wrap it closely in a sheet of thickly-buttered paper, 
tie this securely at the ends, and over the mullet with packthread, and 
roast it in a Dutch oven, or broil it over a clear and gentle fire, or 
bake it in a moderate oven: from twenty to thirty minutes will 
be sufficient generally to dress it in eiUier way, if it lie only of mode* 
xate size. For sauce, put into a little good melted butter the liquor 
which has flowed firom fish, a small dessertspoonfiil of essence of ancho- 
vies, some cayenne, a glass of port wine, or claret, and a little lemon- 
juice. Remove the packttiread, and send the mullet to table in the 
paper case. This is the usual mode of serving it; but it is dished with- 
out the paper, for dinners of high taste. 

20 to 30 minutes. 

TO BOIL ORET MULLET. 

This fish varies so much in size and quality, that it is difficult to give 
exact directions for the time of cooking it. When quite young and 
small, it may be boiled by the receipt for whitings, haddocks, and other 
fish of about their size ; but at its finest growth it must be laid into cold 
water, and managed like larger fish. We have ourselves partaken of 
one which was caught upon our eastern coast, that weighed ten pounds, 
of which the flesh was quite equal to that of salmon, but its weight was, 
we believe, an unusual one. Anchovy, or caper fish sauce, with melted 
butter, mav be sent to table with grey mullet. 

TO FRY SMELTS AND OTHER SMALL FISH. 
In season from beginning of November to May. 

Smelts when quite fi*esh have a perfume resembling that of a cucum- 
ber, and a peculiarly delicate and agreeable flavour when dressed. 
Draw them at the gills, as they must not be opened ; wash and dry 
them thoroughlv in a cloth ; dip them into beaten egg-yolk, and then 
into the finest bread-crumbs, mixed with a small quantity 'of flour; fry 
them of a clear golden brown, and serve them very crisp and dry, witn 
good melted batter in a tureen. They are sometimes dipped into bat- 
ter and then fried ; when this is done, we would recommend for them 
the French batter of Chapter IV. 

3 to 4 minutes.

[to BAKB a SHAB. 

Empty and wash the fish with care, but do not open it more than is 
necessary, and keep on the head and fins. Then stuff it with forcemeat 
Na 2, of Chapter VL Sew it up, or fiuten it with fine skewers, and 
rub the fish over with the j6ik <x eg^ and a little of the stiifiSng. 

Put into the pan in which the fish is to be baked about a gill of wine, 
or the same quantity of water mixed with a tablespooolul of cayenne 
vinegar, or commoo vinegar will do. Baked in a nndeimte oven 1) or 
2 hours, according to its size.

8HAD, TouRAiNB FASHION ; {AlosB d lo fttodc de Touratfie.) 

In Masoo io April, May, and early part of June. 

Empty and wash the fish with cAre, but do not open it more than is 
needfiil ; fill it either with the forcemeat No. 1, or No. 2 of Chapter 
YI., and its own roe ; then sew it up, or fasten it securely with very 
fine skewers, wrap it in a thickly-buttered paper, and broil it gently for 
an hour over a charcoal fire. Serve it with caper sauce, or with cay- 
enne vinegar and melted butter. 

We are indebted for this receipt to a firiend who has been Ions resi- 
dent in Touraine, at whose table the fish is constantly serv^, thus 
dressed, and is considered excellent It is likewise often gently stewed 
in the light white wine of the country, and served covert with a rich 
bechamel. Many fish more common with us than the shad might be 
advantageously prepared in the same manner. Th6 charcoal fire is not 
indispensable : any that is entirely free from smoke will answer. We 
would suggest as an improvement, that oyster-forcemeat should be sub- 
stituted for that which we have indicated, until the oyster season enda 

Broiled gently, 1 hour, more or less, according to its size. 

STEWED TROUT ; (^ood common receipt.) 
In ieaaon from May to August. 

Melt three ounces of butter in a broad stewpan, or well tinned iron 
saucepan, stir to it a tablespoonful of flour, some mace, cayenne, and 
nutmeg; lay in the fish afler it has been emptied, washed very clean, 
and wiped perfectly dry ; shake it in the pan, that it may not stick, and 
when lightly browned on both sides, pour in three quarters of a pint of 
good veal stock, add a small bunch of parsley, one bay leaf, a roll of 
Iemon'«peel, and a little salt: stew the fish very ffently from half to 
three quarters of an hour, or more, should it be unusually fine. Dish 
the trout, skim the &t from the gravy, and pass it through a hot strainer 
over the fish, which should be served immediately. A little acid can 
be added to the sauce at pleasure, and a glass of wine when it is con- 
sidered an improvement This receipt is for one large, or for two mid- 
dling-sized fish. We can recommend it as a good one, from our own 
experience. 

Batter, 3 ozs. ; flour, 1 tablespoonful ; seasoning of mace, cayenne, 
and nutmeg; trout, 1 large, or 2 moderate sized; veal stock, ^ pint; 
parsley, small faggot ; 1 bay-leaf; roll of lemon-rind ; little salt : J to 
i hour. 



CHAP. II.J FMH. "^ 

Obs. — ^Trout may be stewed in equal parts of strong veal gravy, and 
of red or white wine, without having been previously browned ; the 
sauee should then be thickened, and agreeably flavoured with lemon- 
juice, and the usual store-sauces, before it is poured over the fish. They 
are also good when wrapped in buttered paper and baked or broiled : if 
very small, the better mode of cooking them is to fry them whole. 
They should never be plain boiled, as, though a naturally delicious fish, 
they are then very insipid. ^ 

f TO FRY TROUT. 

Clean and dry them thoroughlv in a cloth, fry them plain in hot butter ; 
or beat the white of eg^ on a plate, dip the trout in the egg and then 
in very fine bread-crumbs, which have been rubbed through a sieves- 
biscuit powder is better. Fry them till of a delicate brown ; it takes 
but a few minutes, if the trout be small—^serve with crisp parsley and 
plain melted butter.] 

TO BAKE piKB, OR TROUT; (common receipt) 

Pour warm water over the outside of the fish, and wipe it very clean 
with a coarse cloth drawn from the head downwards, tliat the scales 
may not be disturbed ; then wash it well in cold water, empty, and 
clean the inside with the greatest nicety, fill it either with the common 
forcemeat, Na I, or with No. 4, of Chapter VI., sew it up, fiisten the 
tail to the mouth, give it a slight dredgmg of flour, stick small bits of 
butter thickly over it, and bake it from half to three quarters of an 
hour, should it be of moderate size, and upwards of an hour, if it be 
larffe. Should there not be sufficient sauce with it in the dish, plain 
melted butter, and a lemon, or anchovy sauce may be sent to table with 
it When more convenient, the forcemeat may be omitted, and a little 
fine salt and cayenne, with some bits of butter, put into the inside of 
the fish, which will then require rather less baking. A buttered paper 
should always be laid over it in the oven, should the outside appear 
likely to become too highly coloured, or too dry, before the fish is done ; 
and it is better to wrap quite small pike in buttered ^per at once, be- 
fore they are sent to the oven. 

Moderate-sized pike, 30 to 45 minutes; large pike, 1 to 1^ hour. 

TO BOIL PERCH. 

First wipe or wash ofi* the slime, then scrape ofiT the scales, which 
adheres rather tenaciously to this fish ; empty and clean the insides per- 
fectly, take out the gills, cut ofiT the fins, and lay the perch into equal 
parts of cold and of U>iling water, salted as for mackerel: from eight to 
ten minutes will boil them unless they are very large. Dish them on a 
napkin, garnish them with curled parsley, and serve melted butter with 
them, or Mditre d' Hotel sauce maigre. 

Verv good French cooks put them at once into boiling water, and 
lieep them over a brisk fire for about fifteen minutes. They dress them 
also without taking ofiT the scales or fins until they are ready to serve, 
when they strip the whole of the skin ofiT carefiilly, and stick the red 
fins into the middle of the backs; the fish are then covered with the 
Steward's sauce, thickened with eg^. 

In warm water, 8 to 10 mmutes, in boiling, 12 to 15.

Scale, and dean them perfecthr ; dry them well, flour and fiy them 
in boiling lard. Serve plenty of vied parsley round them. 

TO FRY EEIJS. 

In leason «n the year, but not so well-conditioned in April and May as in other 

months. 

Fbrst kill, then skin, empty, and wash them as clean as possible ; cut 
them into four-inch lenfl^hs, and dry them well in a soft cloth. Season 
them with fine salt, and white pepper, or cayenne, flour them thickly, 
and fry them a fine brown in boiling lard ; drain and dry them as direct- 
ed for soles, and send them to table with plain melted butter and a 
lemon, or the sauce-cruets. Eels are sometimes dipped into batter and 
then fi'ied ; or into egg and fine bread-crumbs (mixed with minced pars- 
ley or not, at pleasure), and served with plenty of crisped parsley round, 
and on them. 

It is an improvement for these modes of dressing the fish to open 
them entirely and remove the bones : the smaller parts should be thrown 
into the pan a minute or two later than the thicker portions of the bodies, 
or they will not be equally done. 

BOII.ED eels; {German receipt,) 

Pare a fine lemon, and strip irom it entirely the white inner rind, 
slice it, and remove the pipe with care, put it with a blade of mace, a 
small half-teaapoonfol of white pepper-corns, nearly twice as much of 
salt, and a moderate-«ized bunch of parsley, into three pints of cold 
water, bring them gently to boil, and simmer them for twenty minutes ; 
let them become quite cold, then put in three pounds of eels skinned, 
and cleaned with great nicety, and cut into lengths of three or four 
inches ; simmer them very sonly from ten to fifteen minutes, lift them 
with a slice into a very hot dish, and serve them with a good Dutch 
sauce, or with parsley and butter acidulated with lem(»i-juice, or with 
vinegar. 

EEUB ; {Cornish receipt,) 

Skin, empty, and wash as clean as possible, two or three fine eels, 
cut them into short lengths, and just cover them with cold water ; add 
sufficient salt and cayenne to season them, and stew them very softly 
indeed from fifteen to twenty minutes, or longer should they require it. 
When they are nearly done, strew over them a tablespoonful of minced 
parsley, thicken the sauce with a teaspoonful of flour mixed witli a slice 
of butter, and add a quarter-pint or more of clotted cream. Give the 
whole a .boil, lift tlie fish into a hot dish, and stir briskly the juice of 
half a lemon into the sauce,; pour it upon the eels, and serve them im- 
mediately. Very sweet thick cream is, we think, preferable to clotted 
cream for this dish. The sauce should be of a good consistence, and a 
dessertspoonful of flour will be needed for a large dish of the stew, and 
from one and a half to two ounces of butter. The size of the fish must 
detormine the precise quantity of liquid and of seasoning which they 
will require. 

By substituting pale veal gravy for water, and thin strips of lemon- 
rind for the parsley, tliis maybe converted into a white fricasse of eels: 
a flavouring of mace must then be added to it, and the beaten yolks of 
two or ^hree eggs, mixed with "a couple of spoonsful of cream, must be

stirred into the sance liefiire the lemon-juice, bat it most on no account 
he allowed to boil afterwards. Rich brown gravy and port wine highly 
spiced, with acid as above, will give another variety of stewed eela. 
For this dish the fish are sometimes firied before they are laid into the 
sauce. 

TO BOIL LOBSTERS. 
In wasoQ flrom April to October. 

Choose them by the directions which we have already given at the 
commencement of this chapter, and throw them into plenty of fast' 
boUiftg salt and water, that life may be destroyed in an instant A 
moderate-sized lobster will be done in from fifteen to twenty-five mi- 
nntes : a large one io from half an hour to forty minutes ; before thev 
are sent to table, the' large claws should be taken 0$ and the shells 
cracked across the joints without disfiguring them ; the tail should be 
separated from the body anck split quite through the middle ; the whole 
neatly dbhed upon a napkin, and garnished with curled parsley or not, 
at choice. A good reraoulade, or any other sauce of the kind that may 
be preferred, should be sent to table with it ; or oil and vinegar, when 
better liked. 

To 1 gallon water 5 ozs. salt Moderate-sized lobster, 15 to 25 mi- 
nutes. Large lobster, 30 to 40 minutes. 

LOBfiTBR FRICASSEED, OR AV BECHAMEL. (EfTTREE.) 

Take the flesh from the claws and tails of two moderate-sized lob- 
sters, cut it ihto small thick slices or dice; heat it slowly quite through 
in about three quarters of a pint of good white sauce or bechamel ; and 
serve it when it is at the point of boiling, after having stirred bnskly 
to it a little lemon-juice, just as it is taken from the fire. The coral, 
pounded and mixed gradually with a few spoonsful of the sauce, should 
be added previously. Good shin of beef stock, made without vegeta- 
bles (see page 53), and somewhat reduced by quick boiling, if mixed 
with an equal proportion of cream, and thickened with arrow-root, will 
answer extremely well, in a general way, for this dish, which is most 
excellent, if well made. The sauce should never be thin ; nor more 
than sufficient in quantity to just cover the fish. For a second course 
dish only as much must be used as will adhere to the fish, which after 
being heated should be laid evenly into the shells after they have been 
. split quite through the centre of the backs in their entire length, with- 
out being broken or divided at the joint, and nicely cleaned. When 
thus arranged, the lobster may be thickly covered with well-dried, fine, 
pale, fried crumbs of bread ; or with untried ones, which must then be 
equally moistened with clarified butter, and browned with a salamander. 
A small quantity of salt, mace, and cayenne, may be required to finish 
the flavouring of either of these preparations. 

BUTTERED CRAB, OR LOBSTER. 
In season during the same time as Lobsters. 
Slice quite small, or pull into light flakes with a couple of forks, the 
flesh of either fish ; put it into a saucepan with a few bits of good but- 
ter lightly rolled in flour, and heat it slowly over a gentle fire; then 
pour over and mix thoroughly with it, from one to two teaspoonsful of 
made-mustard smoothly blended with a tablespoonful or more of com- 
mon vinegar t add to it a tolerable seasoning of cayenne. Grate in a

little nutmeg, and when the whole is well heated serve it immediateljr 
either in the shell of the crah or lobster, or in scollop^hells, Aod serve 
it plain, or with bread-crumbs over, as in the preceding receipt A 
spoonful or so of ffood meat jelly is, we think, a great improvement to 
this dish, for which an ounce and a half of butter will be quite suffi- 
cient 
Crabs are boiled like lobsters. 

[to stew LOBSTERa. 

A middling sized lobster is best : pick all the meat from the shells 
and mince it fine; season with a little salt, pepper, and mited nutmeg; 
add three or four spoons of rich gravy and a small bit or butter. If you 
have no gravy, use more butter, and two spoonsful of vinegar ; stew 
about twenty minutes. 

LOBSTER COLD. 

It is frequently eaten in this way, with 'a dressing of vinegar, mus- 
tard, sweet oil, and a little salt and cayenne. 
The meat of the lobster must be minced very fine. 

TO coos TERRAPINS. 

This is a favourite dish for suppers and parties; and, when well 
cooked, they are certainly very delicious. Many persons in Philadel- 
phia have made themselves famous for cooking this article alone. Mrs. 
Kubicam, who during her lifetime always 6Ux)d first in that way, pre- 
pared them as follows: — Put the terrapins alive in a pot of boiling 
water, where they must remain until they are quite dead. You then 
divest them of their outer skin and toe-nails; and, after washing them 
in warm water, boil them again until they become quite tender, adding 
a handful of salt to the water. Having satisfied yourself of their being 
perfectly tender, take off the shells and clean the terrapins very care- 
fully, removing the sand-bag and gall without breaking them. Then 
cut the meat and entrails into small pieces, and put into a saucepan, 
adding the juice which has been given out in gutting them up, but no 
water, and season with salt, cayenne, and hlack pepper, to your taste ; 
adding a quarter of a pound of good butter to each terrapin, and a hand- 
ful of flour for thickening. After stirring a short time, add four or five 
tablespoonsful of cream, and a half pintT>f good Madeira to every fi)ur 
terrapins, and serve hot in a deep dish. Our own cook has been in the 
habit of putting in a very little mace, a large tablespoonful of mustard, 
and ten drops of the gall ; and, just before serving, adding the yolks of 
four hard boiled eggs. During the stewing, particular attention must 
be paid to stirring tne preparation frequently ; and it must be borne in 
mind, that terrapins cannot possibly be too hot — Sanderson.] 

OYSTERS. 
In season firom September to April. 

The old-fashioned plan o€ feeding oysters with a sprinkling of oat^ 
meal or flour, in addition to the salt and water to which they were com- 
mitted, has long been rejected by all genuine amateurs of these nutri- 
tious and excellent fish, who consider the plumpness which the oysters 
are supposed to gain from the process but pKx>r compensation for the fla- 
vour which they are sure to lose. To cleanse them when they first 
oome up from the beds, and to keep them in good condition for four or 



CHAF. II.] FISH. 81 

five days, they only require to be covered with cold water, with five 
ounces of salt to the gallon dissolved in it before it is poured on them: 
this should be chang-ed with regularity every twenty-fenr hours. By 
following this plan with exactness they may be kept alive from a week 
to ten days, but will remain in perfect condition scarcely more than 
half that time. Oysters should be eaten always the instant they are 
opened. They are served often before the soup, in the first course of a 
dinner, left upon their shells, and arranged usually in as many plates ae 
there are guests at table. 

TO STBW OTBTKRS. 

A pint of small plump oysters will be sufficient ibr quite a moderate* 
sized dish, but twice as many will be required for a larsfe one. Let 
theni be verv carefully opened, and not mangled in the slightest degfree; 
wash them free from grit in their own strained liquor, lay them into a 
very clean stewpan or well-tinned saucepan, strain the liquor a second 
time, pour it on them, and heat them slowly in it When thev are just 
beginning to simmer, lift them out with a slice or a bored wooden spoon, 
and take off the beards ; add to the liquor a quarter-pint of good cream, 
a seasoning of pounded mace and cayenne, and a little salt, and when it 
boils, stir in from one to two ounces of goo^ butter, smoothly mixed with 
a large teaspoonfiil of flour ; continue to stir the sauce until these are 
perfectly blended with it, then put in the oysters and let them remain 
by the side of the fire until they are very hot : they require so little 
cooking, that if kept for four or five minutes nearly simmering, they 
will be ready for table, and they are quickly hardened by being allowed 
to boil, or by too much stewing. S^*ve them garnished with pale fhed 
sippets. Fried breed, see Chapter IV. 

Small plump oysters, 1 pint: their own liquor: brought slowly to the* 
point of simmering. Cream, ^ pint ; seasoning of pounded mace and 
cayenne; salt as needed; butter, 1 to 2 ounces; flour, 1 large tear 
spoonful. 

Obs. — ^A little lemoivjuice should be stirred quickly into the stew 
Just as it is taken from the fire. Another mode of preparing this dish 
18 to add the strained liquor of the oysters to about an equal quantity of 
rich bechamel, with a little additional thickening ; tiien to heat them 
in it, after having jwepared and plumped them properly. Or, the beards 
of the fish may he stewed for half an hour in a little pale veaJ gravy, 
and this, when strained and mixed with the oyster-liquor, may be brought 
to the consistency of cream with the French thickening of Chapter VI., 
or, with flour and butter, then seasoned with spice as above : the pro- 
cess should be quite the same in all of these receipts, though the com- 
position of the sauce is varied. Essence of anchovies, or yolks of eggs 
can be added to the taste. 

TO SCAIXOP OYSTERS. 

Large coarse oysters should never be dressed in this way. Select 
small plump ones for the purpose, let them be opened carefully, give' 
them a scald in their own liquor, wash them in it free from grit, and 
beard them neatly. Butter the scallop shells and shake some fine bread- 
crumbs over them ; fill them with alternate layers of oysters, crumbs 
of bread, and fresh butter cut into small bits ; pour in the oyster-liqucMP, 
after it has been strained, put a thick, smooth layer of bread-crumbs en

the top, moisten them with clarified butter, place the shells in a Dutch 
oven before a clear fire, and turn them oflen till the tops are equally 
and lightly browned : send them immediately to table. 

Some persons like a little white pepper or cayenne, and a flavouring 
of nutmeg added to the oysters ; others prefer pounded mace. French 
cooks recommend with them a mixture of minced mushrooms stewed 
in butter till quite tender, and sweet herbs finely chopped. The fish is 
flometimes laid into the shells after having been bearaed only. 

SCALLOPED OYSTEH8 A LA REINB. 

Plump and beard the oysters^ after having rinsed them well in their 
own strained liquor ; add to this about an equal quantity of very rich 
white sauce, and thicken it, if needful, with a half-teaspoon ful of flour, 
mixed with a small slice of butter, or with as much arrow-root only ; 
put in the oysters, and keep them at the point of simmering for three 
or four minutes ; lay them into the shells, and cover the tops thickly 
with crumbs fried a delicate brown and well dried ; or heap over them 
instead, a layer of fine crumbs ; poiu: clarified butter on them, and brown 
them with a salamander. 

OT8TER SAUSAGES. 

Beard, rinse well in their strained liquor, and mince, but not finely, 
three dozens and a half of plump oysters, and mix them with ten ounces 
of fine bread-crumbs, and ten of beef^uet chopped extremelv small ; 
add a saltspoonful of salt, and one of pepper, or less than half the quan- 
tity of cayenne, twice as much pounded mace, and the third of a small 
nutmefif grated ; moisten the whole with two unbeaten e^gs, or with 
the yolks only of three, and a dessertspoonful of the white& When 
these ingredients have been well worked together, mid are perfectly 
blended, set the mixture in a cool place for two or three hours before it 
is used ; make it into the form of small sausages or sausage-cakes, flour 
and fry them in butter of a fine li^ht brown ; or throw them into boiling 
water for three minutes, drain, and let them become cold, dip them into 
egg and bread-crumbs, and broil them gently qntil they are lightly co- 
loured. A small bit should be cooked and tasted before the whole is 
put aside, that the seasoning may be heightened if required. The sau- 
sages thus made are very good.

placing on top of all a small piece of the best butter. Then put them 
in a hot oven, and let them remain until they acquire a golden colour 
Serve them hot. 

BROILED OYSTERS. 

The oysters should be the largest and finest you can get Prepare 
your gridiron, which should be a double one made of wire, by rubbing 
with butter, and having placed your oysters so that they will all receive 
the heat equally, set them over a brisk fire, and broil both sides without 
burning them. Let them be served hot, with a small lump of freab 
butter, pepper and salt, added to them.] 

ANCHOVIES FRIED IN BATTER. 

Scrape very clean a dozen or more of fine anchovies, and soak them 
in plenty of spring water from two to six hours ; then wipe them dry, 
open them, and take out the back-bones, without dividing the fish. 
Season the insides highly with cayenne, close the anchovies, dip them 
into the French batter of Chapter VI., or into a light English batter, 
and firy them a pale amber-colour: in from four to five minutes they 
will be quite sufficiently done. 



CHAPTER in. 
GRAVIES. 

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 




Gravies are not often required 
either in great variety, or in abun- 
dant quantities, when only a mode- 
rate table is kept, and a clever cook 
will manage to supply, at a trifling 
cost, all that is generally needed 
for plain fiimily dmners ; while an Gravy Kettle, 

unskilfiil or extravagant one will render them sources of unbounded 
expense.* But however small the^ proportions in which they are made, 
their quality should be particularly attended to, and they should be well 
adapted in flavour to the dishes they are to accompany. For some, a 
high degree of savour is desirable; but for fricassees, and other prepara- 
tions of delicate white meats, this should be avoided, and a soft, smooth 
sauce of refined flavour should be used in preference to any of more 
piquant relish. 

Instead of flying the ingredients for brown gravies, which is usually 
done in common English kitchens, French cooks pour to them at flrst a 

.  We know of an instance of a cook who stewed down two or three pounds of 
beef to make gravy for a single brace of partridges; and who complained of the 
wuanfua of ber employers (who were by no means affluent) because this was object- 
ed to. 



84 MODKKN COOKERY. [CHAP. UZ. 

small quantity of liquid, which is reduced by rapid boiling to what is 
terbnically called glaze; particular directions lor which will be found 
iu the next receipt to this, and also at pages 43 and 90. When the 
glaze has acquired the proper colour, boiling broth should be added in 
small portions, and well shaken round the stewpan to detach it entire- 
ly ; the meat may then be stewed gently for three or four hours with & 
few mushrooms, should they be at hand, a bunch of parsley, and some 
green onions. 

A thick slice or two of an unbcHled ham is an almost indispensable 
addition to rich soup or gravy ; and to supply it in the most economical 
manner, a large, highly cured one, or more, not over fatted, should be 
kept for the purpose, and cut as required. The bones of undressed 
meat will supply almost, or quite as good gravy-stock as the meat itself 
if well boiled down, particularly those of the loin, or neck of veal: and 
as the flesh of these may be dressed in many ways advantageously 
without them, the whole joint may be turned to excellent account by so 
dividing it 

The necks of poultry, with the feet properly skinned, a few herbs, a 
morsel or two of ham or of lean bacon, and such slight flavourings be- 
side as the spice-box can supply, with a few drops of good mushroom 
catsup, will of themselves, if well managed, produce sufficient gravy to 
serve with tlie birds from which they are taken; and if not wanted for 
the purpose, they should always be stewed down, or thrown into the stock- 
pot, for which the shank-bones of legs of mutton, and all trimmings of 
meat should likewise be reserved. Excellent broth for the sick or for 
the needy, may also be made of them at little cost, when they are not 
required for other uses. 

To deepen the colour of gravies, the thick mushroom pressings of 
Chapter v., or a little soy (when its flavour is admissible), or cavice, 
or Harvey's sauce'" may be added to it ; and for some dishes, a glass of 
claret, or of port wine. 

Vermicelli, or rasped cocoa-nut, lightly, and very gently browned in 
a small quantity of butter, will both thicken and enrich them, if about 
an ounce of either to the pint of gravy be stewed gently in it from half 
an hour to an hour, and then strained out 

All the ingredients indicated at page 39, for giving consistency to 
soups, will answer equally for gravies, which should not, however, be 
too much thickened, particularly with the unwholesome mixture of flour 
and butter, so commonly used for the purpose. Arrow-root, or rice- 
flour, or common flour gradually browned in a slow oven, are much bet- 
ter suited to a delicate stomach. No particle of fat should ever be per- 
ceptible upon them when they are sent to table ; and when it cannot 
be removed by skimming, they should be allowed to become sufliciently 
cold for it to congeal, and be taken oflTat once without trouble. It may 
be cleared from such as have not been thickened, by passing them 
through a closely woven cloth, which has previously been laid into, and

oance or two of the lean of unboiled ham, cut into dice and ookxtred 
slowly in a small stewpan, or smoothly tinned iron saucepan, with leoe 
than an ounce of buttery a blade of mace, two or three cloves, a bay- 
leaf, a few small sprigs of savoury herbs, and an eschalot or two, or 
about a teaspOonful of minced onion, and a little vonng parsley root, 
when it can be had, will convert common shin of beef stock, or even 
strong broth, into an excellent gravy, if it be gnidually added to them 
after they have stewed slowly hr quite half an hour, and then boiled 
with than ibr twenty minutes or more. The liquid should not be mixed 
with the other ingredients until the side of the stewpan is coloured of a 
reddish brown ; and should any thickening be required, a teaspoonfuI of 
flour should be stirred in well, and simmered ibr three or four minutes 
before the stock is added : the pan should be strongly shaken round after- 
wards to detach the browning from it, and this must be done often while 
the ham is stewing. 

Obs. — ^The cook who is not acquainted with this mode of preparing 
or enriching gravies, will do well to make herself acquainted with it; 
as it presents no difficulties, and is exceedingly convenient and advan- 
tageous when they are wanted in small quantities, Yery hi^hlv flap 
voured and well coloured. An unboiled ham, kept in cut, willoe found, 
as we have alreadv said, a great economy for this, and c^er purposes, 
savingf much of the expense commonly incurred for gravy-meats. As 
eschalots, when sparingly used, impart a much finer savour than onions^ 
though they are not commonly so much used in England, we would re- 
commend that a small store of them should always Be kept 

SHIN OF BEEF STOCK, (for Oravies.) 

There is no better foundation for strong gravies than shin of beef 
stewed down to a jelly (which it easily becomes), with the addition cmly 
of some spice, a bunch of savoury herbs, and a moderate proportion of 
salt; this, if kept in a cool larder, boiled softly for two or three minutes 
every second or third day, and each time put into a clean, wellnBcalded 
pan, will remain good for many days, and may easily be converted into 
excellent soup or gravy. Let the bone be broken in one or two places, 
take out the marrow, which, if not wanted for immediate use, should be 
clarified, and stored for future occasions; put a pint and a half ^ cold 
water to the pound of beef, and stew it very gently indeed for six or 
seven hours, or even longer should the meat not then be quite in firag^ 
ment& The bones of calf's feet which have been boiled down for Jelly, 
the liquor in which Uie head has been cooked, and any remains of ham 
quite freed from the smoky parts, firom rust and fitt, will be serviceable 
additions to this stock. A couple of pounds of the neck of beef may be 
added to six of the shin with very good efifect ; but for white soup or 
sauces this is better avoided.

RICH PALE VEAL OBAVY, OR, OONBOMMEE. 

The French, who have always at hand their stock-pot of good houH' 
Ion (beef soup or broth), make great use of it in preparing their gra* 
vies. It is added instead of water to the fresh meat, and when iJiis, in 
somewhat large proportions, is boiled down in it, with the addition only of 
a bunch of parsley, a few green onions, and a moderate seasoning of

Mbit, a BtfOD^ and very pare-Akvoitved pale gmvy is 'pmdneed. Wben 
Uie best joiots of fowls, or of partridges have bean taken for firieaasees 
or cutlets, the remainder may be stewed with a pound or two of veal 
into a coosemraee, which then takes the name of chicken or of game 
Ifravy. For a larg^ 4inner it is always desirable to have in readiness 
«uch stock ^Ji can easily and quickly be converted into white and oth^ 
sauces. To make this, arrange a slice or two of Jean ham in a stew- 
|Nm or saucepan with three pounds of the neck of veal once or twice 
divided (onless the thick fleshy part of the knuckle can be had), and 
{NNir to tiiem three full pints of strong beef or veal broth; or if this 
cannot conveniently be done, inorease the pnopovtbn of -meat or dimiup 
•iflh that of the liquid, substituting water for tbe Ibroth, throw in some 
jalt after the boiling has commenced, and the gravv has been well akioa*- 
med, with one mild onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, a little celery, if 
in season, a carrot, a blade of mace, and a half-saltspoonibl of peppep* 
-corns; stew these very gently fiX four hours; then, should Uie-meat be 
quite in fragments, strain off the gravy, and let it become sqfficiently 
cold to allow the fht to be entirely cleared from it A handfol of nicely 
j>repared mushroom-buttons will much improve its flavour; and the 
bones c^ boiled ealTs foet, or the fresh ones of fowls will be .found ex;- 
.cellent additions to it A better method of making it, when time and 
trouble are not regarded, is to heat the meat, which oiwht then to be 
free of bones, quite through, with from a quarter to half a pint of broth 
only, and when on probing it with the point of a knifo no blood issues 
from it, and it has been turned and equally done, 'to moisten it with the 
remainder of the broth, which should be boiling.

A RICH ENGLISH BROWN ORATT. 

Brown lightly and carefully from four to six ounces of lean ham, 
thickly sliced and oat into^large dice ; lifl these oat, and put (hem into 
Che pan in whioh the gravy is to be made ; next, frjr lightly also^ a com 
pie of peuadeof neck of beef, dredged moderately with flour, and slight*

geulfyt and! add to them one not large common onion. Pour over these 
ingredients a quart of boiling water, or of weak but well>flavoured brot^ 
bring the whole slowly to a boil, elear off the scum with gfeat care, 
throw in a sahspoonfiil of sah, four cloves, a blade of mace, twenty corns

these last two may be fried or not, as is most convenient Boil the 
gravy very softly until it is reduced to little more than a pint ; straiut 
and set it by until the fat can be taken from it Heat it anew, add more 
Bah if needed, and a little mushroom catsup, cayenne-vmegar, or what- 
ever flavouring it may require for the dish with which it is to be served: 
it will seldom need any thickening. A dozen small mushrooms prepared 
as for pickling, may be added to it at first with advantage. Half this 
quantity of gravy will be sufficient for a single tureen, and the ecoa&> 
mist can diminish a little the proportion of meat when it is thought too 
much. 

ORAVT FOR YENISON. 

If possible, let this be made with a little of the neck, or of any odd

CHEAP GRAVY FOR A ROAffT FOWL. ^^ 

When there is neither broth nor gravy to be had, nor meat of whidi 
either can be made, boil the neck of the fowl after having cut it smaQ, 
in half a pint of water with any slight seasonings of spice or herbs, or 
with a litUe salt and pepper only; it should stew very sofUy for an hour 
or more, or the quantity will be too much reduced. When the bird is 
just rcHady for table, take the gravy from the dripping-pan, and drain 
off the fat from it as closely as possible ; strain the liquor from the neck 
to it, mixing them smoothly, pass the gravy a^ain through the strainer, 
heat it, add salt and pepper or cayenne, if needed, and serve it extreme- 
ly hot When this is done, the fowl should be basted with good butter 
only, and well floured when it is first laid to the ^re. Many cooks 
always mix the gravy from the pan when ^me is roasted with that 
which they send to tabl^ with it, as they think that tiiis enriches the 
flavour; but it is not always considered an improvement by the eaters.

A little good broth added to half a dozen dice of lean ham, lightly 
browned in a morsel of butter, with half a dozen corns of pepper and a 
small branch or two of parsley, and stewed for half an hour, will make 
excellent gravy of a common kind. When there is no broth, the neck 
df the chicken must be stewed down to supply its place. 

QUITE COMMON BROWN OBAYT. 

Cut a sheep's melt into slices half an inch thick, flour them lightly, 
and either fry them a pale brown, or dissolve a small slice of butter m 
a thick saucepan, lay them in and shake them over a moderate fire until 
they have taken sufficient colour ; then pour gradually to them between 
half and three quarters of a pint of boiling water ; add a not very full 
seasoning of salt and pepper, and stew the gravy very gently for up- 
wards of an hour and a half. Strain, and skim off the fat, and it will be 
ready for table. When it is to accompany ducks or geese, brown a 
minced onion with the melt, and add a sprig of lemon thyme. This, 
though a very cheapi is a rich gravy in flavour ; but it would be infi- 
nitely improved by using for it equal parts of neck of beef (or of beef 
steak) and sheep's melt ; or the bone and the lean only of a thick mut- 
ton cutlet A little catsup, or a very small quantity of spice, will like- 
wise be good additions to it ; and a slice or two of a root of celery, and 
of a carrot, might be boiled down with the meat A bit or two of lean 
ham will heighten greatly the flavour of aW brown gravies.

spice, or bit or two of lean ham t^t choice.) 

Obs. — Part of an ox's melt is sometimes used for gravy in common 
cookery, but it is, we should say, too coarse for the purpose, and the fla- 
vour is peculiarly, and we think disagreeably, sweet ; but a skilful cook, 
may perhaps, by artificial means, render it more palatable.

all uncooked meat except pork.

third of a pint of good brown gravy; let this simmer fifteen minutes; 
strain it; bring it again to the point of boiling, and add to it a teaspoon- 
Ail of flaiade-mustard mixed well with a glass of port wine. Season it 
with cayenne pepper, and salt, if this last be needed. Do not let the

MEAT JELLIES FOB PIES AND SAUCES. 

A very firm meat jelly is easilv made by stewing slowly down equal 
parts of shin of beef, and knuckle or neck of veal, with a pint of cold 
water to each pound of meat ; but to give it flavour, some thick slices 
of lean unboiled ham should be added to it, two or three carrots, some 
spice, .a bunch of parsley, one mild onion, or more, and a moderate quan- 
tity^ salt; or part of the meat may be omitted, and a calf's-head, or the 
scalp of one, very advantageously substituted for it, though the flavouring 
must then be heightened, because, though veij gelatinous, these are in 
themselves exce^ingly insipid to the taste. If rapidly boiled, the jelly 
will not be clear, and it will be difficult to render it so without clarify- 
ing it with the whites of eggs, which it ought never to require ; if very 
gently stewed, on the contrary, it will only need to be paE»ed through a 
fine sieve, or cloth. The fat must be carefully removed, after it is quite 
cold. The shin of beef recommended for this and other receipts, should 
be fix)m the middle of the leg of young heifer beef, not of that which is 
large and coarse. 

Middle of small shin of beef, 3 lbs. ; knuckle or neck of veal, 3 lbs. ; 
lean of ham, ^ lb. ; water, 3 quarts ; carrots, 3 large, or 2 small ; bunch 
of parsley ; 1 mild onion, stuck with 8 cloves ; 2 small bay-leaves ; 1 
large blade of mace; small saltspoonful of peppercorns; salt,! oz. (more 
if needed) : 5 to 6 hours* very gentle stewing. 

Obs, — A finer jelly may be made by using a larger jnroportion of veal 
than of beef^ and by adding clear beef or veal broth to it instead of water, 
in a small proportion at first, as directed in the receipt for consommee, 
see page 85, and by pouring in the remainder when the meat is heated 
through. The necks of poultry, any inferior joints of them omitted from 
a fricassee, or other dish, or an old fowl, will further improve it much ; 
an eschalot or two may at choice be boiled down in it, instead of the 
onion, but the flavour should be scarcely perceptible. 

A CHEAPER MEAT JELLY. 

One cairs foot, a pound and a half or two pounds of neck of veal or 
beef, a small onion, a carrot, a bunch of parsley, a little spice, a bit oi 
two of quite lean ham, dressed or undressed, and &ve half pints of watei, 
boiled very slowly for ^ve or six hours will give a strong, though not a 
highly flavoured jelly. More ham, an^ bones of unboiled meat, poultry, 
or game will, in this respect, improve it; and the liquor in which fowls 
or veal have been boiled for table should, when at hand, be used for it 
instead of water. These jellies keep much better and longer when no 
vegetables are stewed down in them. 

GLAZE. 

This IS merely strtmg, clear gravy or jelly boiled quickly down to 
the consistency of thin cream; but this reduction must be carefully

mameed that the glaze may he brought to the proper pcnnt without 
being Durned ; it must be attentively watched, and stiired without being 
quitted for a moment from the time of its beginning to thicken; when 
it has reached the proper degree of boiling, it will jelly in dropping from 
the spoon, like preserve, and should then be poilrra out immediately, or 
it will bum. When wanted for use, melt it gently byplacing the ve»- 
sel which contains it (see article Glazinff, Chapter VlL) in a pan of 
boiling water, and with a paste-brush lay it on to the meat, upon which 
it will form a sort of clear varnish. In ccmsequence of the very great 
reduction which it undergoes, salt should be added to it sparingly when 
it is made. Any kind of stock may be boiled down to glaze ; but junless 
it be strong, a pint will afS>rd but a spoonful or two ; a small quantity 
of it, however, is generally sufficient, unless a lar^e repast is to lie 
served. Two or three layers must be given to each joint The jellies 
which precede this will answer for it extremely well; and it may be 
made also with shin of beef stock, for common occasions, when no cSher 
is at hand. 

ASPIC, OR CLEAR SAVOITRT-OBLLT. 

Boil a couple of calTs feet, with three or four pounds of knuckle of 
. veal, three-quarters of a pound of lean ham, two large onions, three 
whole carrots, and a large bunch of herbs, in a gallon of water, till it is 
reduced more than halfl Strain it off; when perfectly cold, remove 
every particle of fiit and sediment, and put the lelly into a very clean 
stewpan, with four whites of eggs well beaten ; keep it stirred until it 
is nearly boiling; then pkce it by the side of the fire to simmer for a 
quarter of an hour. Let it settle, and pour it through a jelly-bsf until 
. it is quite clear. Add, when it first begins to boil, three blades of inace, 
a teaspoonful of white peppercorns, ana sufficient salt to flavour it pro- 
perly, allowing for the ham, and the reduction. French cooks flavour 
this jelly with taragon vinegar when it is clarified : cold poultry, game, 
and fish are served in, or garnished with.it; when it is to be moulded, 
with slices of boiled tongue laid in the middle in a chain, or carved fowl, 
or aught else, it will be well to throw in a pinch of isinglass; and hams 
are often placed on a thick layer of it rougrhed, and then covered en- 
tirely with more for large break&sts, or cold repasts. It is also used as 
gravy for meat pie&

^ CHAPTER IV. 

SAUCES. 

INTRODTTCrrORT REMARKS. 

This difibrenee between gfood 
and bftd cookery can scarcely 
be more strikingly shown than 
in the manner in which sauces 
are prepared and served. If 
well made, appropriate to the 
dishes they accomiMiny, and sent 
to table with them as not as pos- 
Bmin jifort«, or Water Bath. sible, they not only give a height- 

ened relish to a dinner, but they prove that Jboth skill and taste have 
have been exerted in its arrangements. When coarsely or carelessly 
prepared, on the contrary, as tSey too often are, they greatly discredit 
the cook, and are any thmg but acceptable to the eaters. Melted butter, 
the most common of all — the '^om sauce** of England and America, 
which excites the raillery of fiffeigner»—is frequently fomid to be sudi 
an intolerable compound, either oued or lumpy, or composed principally 
of flour and water, that it says but little for the state of eookeiyamengst 
us. We trust that the receipts in the present chapter are so elearly 
given, that if strictly followed they will materially assist the lei^oer in 
preparing tolerably palatable sauces at the least The cot at the com- 
mencement of the chapter exliibits the vessel called a bain marie, in 
which saucepans are placed when it is necessary to ke^ their contests 
hot without allowing them to boil : it is extremely useful when dinners 
are delayed after they are ready to serve. 

TO THICKEN SAUCES. 

When this is done with the yolks of eg|;s, they should first be w^ 
beaten, and then mixed with a spoonful ofcold stock, should it be at 
hand, and with one or two of the boiling sauce, which should be stirred 
very quickly to them, and they must in turn be stirred briskly to the 
sauce, which may be held over the fire, and well shaken fot an instant 
afterwards, but never placed upon it, nor allowed to boil. 

To the rottx or French thickening (which follows,) the gravy or other 
liquid which is to be mixed with it should be poured boiling, and in 
small quantities, the saucepan being often well shaken round, and the 
sauce made to boil up after each portion is added. If this precaution 
be observed, the butter will never float upon the sur&ce, but the whole 
will be well and smoothly blended : it will otherwise be difficult to clear 
the sauce firom it perfectly. 

For invalids, or persons who object to butter in their soups or sauces, 
flour only, mixed to a smooth batter and stirred into the boiling liquid, 
may be substituted for other thickening : arrow-root also, need in the 
same way, will answer even better than flour.

when it is required finr Tarious dishes at the nme time, or for cookery 
upon a large scale, it can be prepared at once in sufficient quantity to 
last for several days, and it will remain good for some time. Dissolve 
with a very efentle decree of heat, half a pound of good butter, then 
draw it from the fire, skim it well, give time for it to settle, pour it gen- 
tly from the sediment into a very clean frying-pan, and place it over a 
slow but clear fire. Put into a dredging box about seven ounces of fine 
dry flour; add it gradually to the butter, shake the pan often as it is 
thrown in, and keep the thickeniuff constantly stirred until it has ac- 
quired a clear light brown colour. It should be very slowly and equally 
done, or its flavour will be unpleasant. Pour it into a jar, and stir a 
spoonfiil or two as it is needed into boiling soup or gravy. When the 
butter is not clarified it will absorb an additional ounce of flour, the 
whole of which ought to be fine and dry. This thickening may be 
made in a well-tinned stewpan even better than in a frying-pan, and if

WHITE ROUS, OB FRENCH THICKENINO. 

Proceed exactly as for the preceding receipt, but dredge in the flour 
as soon as the butter is in full simmer, and be careful not to allow the 
tiiickening to take the slightest colour : this is used f<Nr white gravies 
or sauces. 

8AUCE TOURNEB, OR, PALE THICKENED ORAYT. 

Sauce toumee is nothing more than rich pale gravy made with veal 
or poolt^ (see consommee, pase 85) and thickened with delicate white 
roux. The French give it a &vouring of mushrooms and green onions, 
by boiling some of each in it for about half an hour before the sauce is 
' served ; it must tiien be strained previously to being dished. Either 
first dissolve an ounce of butter, and then dredge gradually to it three 
quarters of an ounce of flour, and proceed as for the precedmg receipt; 
or blend the flour and butter perfectly with a knife, before they are 
thrown into the stewpan, and keep thenkstirred without ceasing over a 
clear and gentle fire until they have simmered for some minutes, then 
place the stewpan high over the fire, and shake it constantly until the 
roux has lost the raw taste of the flour ; next, stir very gradually to it a 
pint of the grayy, which should be boiling : set it by the side of the 
stove for a few minutes and skim it thoroughly. 

Butter, 1 oz. ; flour, | oz. ; strong, pale gravy, seasoned with mush- 
rooms and green onions, 1 pint. 

Obs. 3. — ^With the addition of three or four yolks of very fresh eggs, 
mixed with a seasoning of mace, cavenne, and lemon-juice, this be- 
comes German sauce, now much used for fHcassees, and other dishes; 
and minced parsley (boiled) and cayenne vinegar, each in sufficient 
quantity to flavour it agreeably, convert it into a good fish sauce. 

BECHAMEL. 

This is a fine French white sauce, now very much served at good 
Englidi tables. It may be made in various ways, and more or less 
expensively ; but it should always be thick, smooth, and rich, though 
delicate in flavour. The most ready mode of preparing it, is to ta!ke 
an equal proportion of very strong, pale veal gravy, and of good cream

(a pint of each, fer example), and then by rapid boiling over a very 
clear fire, to reduce the gravy nearly half; next, to mix with part oT 
the cream a tablespoonfiil of fine dry flour, to pour it to the remainder, 
when it boils, and to keep the whole stirred for five mintrte^ or more 
over a ^ow fire, for if placed upon a fierce one, it would be liable to 
bum ; then to add the gravy, to stir and mix the sauce perfectly, and 
to simmer it for a few minutes longer. All the flavour should be given 
by the gravy, in which French cooks boil a handfiil of mushrooms^ a 
few green onions, and some branches of parsley befcfl*e it is reduced : 
but a good bechamel may be made without them, with a strong con>i 
sommee. (See pale veal gravy, page 86) well reduced. 

Strong pale veal gravy (flavoured witn mushrooms or not), 1 pint: 
reduced half. Rich cream, 1 pint; flour, 1 tablespoonfiil: 5 minutes. 
With gravy, 4 or 5 minutes. 

06«. — Vehnte, which is a rather thinner sauce or gravy, is made by 
simply well reducing the cream and stock separately, and then mixing 
them together without any thickening. 

COMMON Sf CHAMEL. 

Cut half a pound e^veal, and a slice of lean ham into small dice, and 
0tew them in butter, with vegetables, as directed m the foregoing re- 
ceipt : stir in the same proportion of flour, then add the milk, and let 
the sauce boil very gently for an hour. It should not be allowed to 
thicken too ranch before it » strained. 

Oh$. — Common bechamel^ with the addition of a ^ooaful of made- 
mustard, is an excellent sauce for boiled mutton. 

KicH MBi/rsiy mnrnsft. 

This is more particularly required in general for lobster sauce, when 
it is to be served with turbot or brill, and for good oyster sauce as well. 
Salmon is itself so rich, that less butter is needed for it than for sauce 
which is to accompany a drier fish. Mix to a very anoofh batter a 
dessertspoonful of flour, a half^saltspoonful of salt, and half a pint of 
cold water; put these into a delicately clean saucepan, with fix)m four 
to six ounces of Welt-flavoured butter, cut into small bits, and shakethe 
sauce strongly round, alihost without cessation, until the ingredients 
are perfectly blended, and it is on the point of boiling ; let it simmer 
for two or three minutes, and it will be ready for use. The best French 
cooks recommend its not being allowed to boil, as they say it tastes less 
of flour if served when it is just at the point of simmering.^

VERY COMMON WHITE SAUCE. 

The neck and the feet of a fewl, nicely cleaned, and stewed down in 
half a pint of water, until it is reduced to less than a quarter-pint, with 
a thin strip or two of lemon-rind, a small blade of mace, a small branch 
or two of parsley, a little salt, and half a dozen corns of pepper, then 
strained, thickened, and flavoured by the preceding receipt, and mixed 
witlp something more than half the quantity of cream, will answer fer 
this sauce extremely well ; and if it be added, when made, to the liver 
of the chicken, previously boiled for six minutes in the gravy, then 
bruised to a smooth paste, and passed through a sieve, it will become an 
excellent liver sauce. A little strained lemon-juice is generally added 
to it when it is ready to serve : it should be stirred very briskly in. 

DUTCH SAUCE. 

Put into« small saucepan the yolks of three fi'esh eggs, the juice of 
a large lemon, three ounces of butter, a little salt and nutmeg, and a 



CHAP. IV.3 8AVCB6. 97 

\viiieglassful of water. Hold the saucepan over a clear fire, and keep 
the sauce stirred until it nearly boils : a little cayenne ma^ be addeo. 
The safest way of making all sauces that will curdle by bemg allowed 
to boil, is to put them into a jar, and to set the jar-over the fire, in a 
saucepan of boiling water, and then to stir the ingredients constantly 
until the sauce is Siickened sufficiently to serve. 

Yolks of eggs, 3; juice, 1 lemon; butter, 3 ozs.; little salt and nut- 
meg; water, 1 wineglassful ; cayenne at pleasure. 

Obs, — ^A small cupful of veal gravy, mixed with plenty of blanched 
and chopped parsley, may be useu instead of water for this sauce, when 
it is to be served with boiled veal, or with calPs head. 

miCASSEE SAUCE. 

Stir briskly, but by degrees, to the well beaten yolks of two large, or 
of three small fresh eggs, half a pint of common English white saace ; 
put it again into the saucepan, give it a shake over the fire, but be ex- 
tremely careful not to allow it to boil, and just before it is served stir in 
a dessertspoonful of strained lemon-juice. When meat or chickens are 
fricasseed, they should be lifled from the saucepan with a slice, drained 
on it from the sauce, and laid into a very hot dish before the eggs are 
added, and when these are just set, the sauce should be poured on them. 

BREAD SAUCE. 

Pour quite boiling on half a pint of the finest bread-crumbs, an equal 
measure of new milk ; cover them closely with a plate, and let the sauce 
remain for twenty or thirty minutes ; put it then into a delicately clean 
saucepan, with a small saltspoonful of salt, half as much pounded mace, 
a little cayenne, and about an ounce of fresh butter ; keep it stirred con- 
stantly over a clear fire for a few minutes, then mix with it a couple of 
spoonsfiU of good cream, give it a boil, and serve it immediately. When 
cream is not to be^had, an additional spoonful or two of milk roust be 
used ; and as the sauce ought to be perfectly smooth, it is better to 
shake the crumbs through a cullender before the milk is poured to them ; 
they should be of stale bread, and very lightly grated. As some will 
absorb more liquid than others, the cook must increase a little the above 
proportion, should it be needed. Equal parts of milk and of thm cream 
make an excellent bread sauce : more butter can be used to enrich it 
when it is liked. 

Bread-crumbs and new milk, each ^ pint (or any other measure^ * 
soaked 20 to 30 minutes, or more. Salt, small saltspoonful ; mace, half 
as much ; little cayenne ; butter, 1 oz. : boiled 4 to 5 minutes. 2 to 4 
spoonsful of good cream (or milk): 1 minute. Qr: bread-crumbs, ^ 
pint; milk and cream, each i pint; and from 2 to 4 spoonsful of either 
in addition. 

Obs. — ^Very pale, strong veal gravy is sometimes poured on the 
bread-crumbs, instead of milk; and these, after being soaked, are 
boiled extremely dry, and then brought to the proper consistency with 
rich cream. The gravy may be highly flavoured with mushrooms 
when this is done. 

BREAD 8AUCB WITH ONION. 

Put into a very clean saucepan nearly half a pint of fine bread- 
crumbs, and the white part of a large mid onion, cut into quartan;

poor to these three quarters of a pint of new milk, and boil them very 
gently, keeping them often stirred, until the onion is perfectly tender, 
which will be in from forty minutes to an hour. Press the whole 
through a hair-sieve, which should be as clean as possible ; reduce the 
sauce by quick boiling, should it be too thin ; add a seasoning of salt 
and grated nutmeg, an ounce of butter, and four spoonsful c? cream, 
and when it is of the proper thickness, dish, and send it quickly to 
table. 

Bread-crumbs, nearly | pint; white part of 1 large mild onion ; new 
milk, ) pint: 40 to 60 minutes. Seasoning of salt and grated nutmeg; 
butter, 1 oz. ; cream, 4 tablespoonsful : to be boiled till of a proper con- 
sistency. 

Obs. — This is an excellent sauce for those who like a svbdued fla- 
vour of onion in it ; but as many persons object to any, the cook should 
ascertain whether it be liked before she follows this receipt 

COMMON LOBSTER SAUCE. 

Add to half a pint of good melted butter, a tablespoonful .of essence 
of anchovies, a small half-saltspoonful of freshly pounded mace, and 
less than a quarter one of cayenne. If a couple of spoonsful of cream 
are at hand, stir them to the sauce when it boils ; then put in the flesh 
of the tail and claws of a small lobster cut into dice (or any other form) 
of equal size. Keep the saucepan by the side of the fire until the fii^ 
is quite heated through, but do not let the sauce boil again : serve it 
very hot. A small quantity can be made on occasion wi8i the remains 
of a lobster which has been served at table. 

Melted butter, i pint; essence of anchovies,* 1 tablespoonful; pound 
ed mace, small ^ saltspoonful ; less than ^ one of cayenne ; cream (if 
added), 2 tablespoonsful ; flesh of small lobster. 

GOOD LOBSTER SAUCE. 

Select for this a perfoctly fresh hen lobster; split the tail carefully, 
and take out the inside coral ; pound half of it in a mortar very smoothly 
with less than an ounce of butter, rub it through a- hair-sieve, and put 
it aside. Cut the firm flesh of the fish into dice of not less than half 
an inch in size ; and when these are ready, make as much good melted 
butter as will supply the quantity of sauce required for tabk, and if to 
be served with a turbot, or other large fish, to a numerous company, let 
it be plentifully provided. Season it well with cayenne, mace, and 
salt; add to it a few spoonsful of rich cream, and then mix a sma]l por 
tion of it very gradually with the pounded coral ; when this is suffi- 
ciently liquefied, pour it into the sauce, and . stir the whole well to- 
gether ; put in immediately the flesh of the fish, and heat the sauce 
thoroughly by the side of the fire, without allowing it to boil, for if it 
should do so its fine colour would be destroyed. The whole of the 
coral may be used for the sauce when no porticai of it is required for 
other purposes. 

GOOD OYSTER SAUCE.

again, and pour it to them ; heat them slowly, and keep them from one 
to two minates at the simmering point, without allowing them to 601^ 
as that will render them hard. Lift them out and beard them neatly ; 
add to the liquor three ounces of butter, smoothly mixed with a large 
deesertspoonfiil of flour ; stir these without ceasing until they boilv and 
are perfectly mixed; then add to them graduafly a quarter-pint, or 
rather more, of new milk, or of thin cream (or equal parts of both), 
and continue the stirring until the sauce boils again ; add a little salt, 
should it be needed, and a small quantity of cayenne in the finest pow- 
der ; put in the oysters, and keep the sancepan by the side of the fire, 
until the whole is thoroughly hot, and begins to simmer, then turn the 
sauce into a well-heated tureen, and send it immediately to table. 

Small plump oysters, 3 dozens; butter, 3 ozs; flour, 1 large desert- 
spoonful ; the oyster-liquor ; milk or cream, full ^ pint * little salt and 
cayenne. 

COMMON OYSTER SAUCE. 

Prepare and plump two dozens of oysters as directed in the receipt 
above ; add their strained liquor to a quarter-pint of thick melted butter 
made with milk, or with half milk and half water ; stir the whole until 
it boils, put in the oysters, and when they are quite heated through, 
send the sauce to table without delay. Some persons like a little cay- 
enne and essence of anchovies added to it when it is served with fish ; 
others prefer the unmixed flavour of the oysters. 

Oysters, 2 dozens ; their liquor ; melted butter, \ pint (Little cay- 
enne and 1 desertspoonful of essence of anchovies when liked.) 

CREAM 8AVGB FOR FISH. 

Knead very smoothly togeth'er with a strong bladed knife, a large 
teaspoonful of flour with three ounces of good butter; stir them in a 
very clean saucepan or stewpan, over a gentle fire until the butter is 
dissolved, then throw in a little salt, and some cayenne, give the whole 
one minute's simmer, and add, very gradually, half a pint of good cream ; 
beep the sauce constantly stirred until it boils, then mix with it a dessert- 
spoonful of essence of anchovies, and half as much vinegar or lemon- 
juice. The addition of shelled shrimps, or lobster cut in dice, will con- 
vert this at once into a most excellent sauce of either. Pounded mace 
may be added to it with the cayenne ; and it may be thinned with a 
few spoonsful of milk should it be too thick. Omit the essence of an- 
chovies, and mix with it some parsley boiled very green, and minced, 
and it becomes a good sauce for boiled poultry. 

Butter, 3 ozs. ; flour, 1 large teaspoonful : 2 to 3 minutes. Cream, 
} pint; essence of anchovies, 1 large dessertspoonful (more if liked); 
vinegar or lemon-juice, 1 teaspoonful ; salt, ^ saltspoonfiil.

rajENCH MAITRS d'hOTEL,* OR fiTTEWAllD's BAUCS. 

Add to half a pint of rich, pale veal gravy, well thickened with the 
white roux of page 93, a good seasoning of pepper, salt, minced parsley, 
and lemon-juice ; or make the thickening with a small tablespoonful of 
.flour, and a couple of ounces of butter ; keep these stirred constantly 
over a very gentle fire from ten to fifteen minutes, then pour to them 
the gravy, boiling, in small portions, mixing the whole well as it is 
added, and letting it boil up between each, far unless this be done, the 
butter will be likelv to float upon the surface. Simmer the sauce for a 
few minutes, and skim it well, then add salt should it be needed, a tole- 
rable seasoning of pepper or of cayenne, in fine powder, from two to 
three teaspoonsful of minced parsley, and the stramed juice of a small 
lemon. For some dishes, this sauce is thickened with the yolks of eggs, 
about four to the pint The French work into their sauces generally a 
small bit of fresh butter, just before they are taken from the fire, to give 
them mellowness: this is done usually for the M^itre d^Hotel.

a pint of sauce tournee, or of cream fish-sauce, previously well seasoned 
with cayenne and salt, and moderately with pounded mace ; bring it to 
the point of boiling only, stir in quickly, but gradually, a tablespoonful 
of strained lemon-juice, and serve it very hot When neither cream 
nor gravy is at hand, substitute rich melted butter, mixed with a des- 
sertspoonful or two of essence of anchovies, and well seasoned. The 
fine colour of the coral will be destroyed by boiling. This sauce, which 
the French call Sauce d VAurore^ may be served with brill, boiled soles, 
grey mullet, and some few other kinds of fish : it is quickly made when 
the lobster butter of Chapter XIV. is in the house.

potnUe on a fine grater, then with two ounces (or a couple of large 
tahlespoonsful) of it, mix a small teaspoonful of ealt, and four tablo- 
spoonsfUl of good cream ; stir in briskly and by degrees, three dessert- 
spoonsful of vinegar. To heat the sauce, put it into a small and deli- 
cately clean saucepan, hold it over, but do not place it upon the fire, 
and stir it without intermission until it is near the point of simmering, 
but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle instantlv. 

Horseradish pulp, 2 ozs. (or, 2 large tablespoonsml) ; salt, 1 teaspoon- 
fill ; good cream, 4 tablespoonsful ; vinegar, 8 dessertspoonsful. 

Obs. — Common English salad-mixture is often added to the grated 
horseradish when the sauce is to be served cold. 

HOT HORSERADISH SAUCE ; (to sewe with boiled or stewed meat, orjish.) 

Mix three ounces of young, tender, grated horseradish with half a 
pint of good brown gravy, and let it stand by the side of the fire until it 
is on the point of boiling ; add salt if required, a teaspoonful of made- 
mustard, and a dessertspoonful of garlic or of eschalot vinegar, if at 
hand; if not, twice as much common vinegar for it. 

Some cooks stew the horseradish in vmegar for ten minutes, and 
after having drained it from this, mix it with nearly half a pint of thick 
melted butter. 

Horseradish, grated, 8 ozs. ; brown gravy, i pint ; made-mustard, 1 
teaspoonful ; eschalot or garlic vinegar, 1 dessertspoonfiil (or common 
vinegar, twice as much). 

CHRISTOPHER NORTH*8 OWN SAUCE FOR MANY MEATS. 

Throw into a small basin a heaped saltspoonful of good cayenne pep-, 
per, in very fine powder, and half the quantity of salt ; * add a small 
dessertspoonful of well-refined, pounded and sifted sugar ; mix these 
thoroughly.; then pour in a tablespoonful of the strained juice of a fresh 
lemon, two of Harvey's sauce, a teaspoonful of the very best mushroom 
catsup (or of cavice), and three tablespoonsful, or a small wineglassful, 
of port wine. Heat the sauce by placing the basin in a saucepan of 
boiling water, or turn it into a jar, and place this in the water. Serve 
it directly it is ready with geese or ducks, tame or wild ; roast pork, 
venison, fiiwn, a grilled blade-bone, or any other broil. A slight flavour 
of garlic or eschalot vine^r may be ^iven to it at pleasure. Many 
persons use it with fish. It is good cold ; and, if bottled directly it is 
made, may be stored for several days. It is the better for being mixed 
isome hours before it is served. The proportion of cayenne may be 
doubled when a very pungent sauce is desired. 

Good cayenne pepper in fine powder, 1 heaped saltspoonful; salt, 
half as much; pounded sugar, 1 small dessertspoonful; strained lemon- 
juice, 1 tablespoonful; Harvey's sauce, 2 tablespoonsful; best mush- 
room catsup, 1 teaspoonful ; port wine, 3 tablespoonsful, or small wine- 
glassful. (Little eschalot, or garlic-vinegar at pleasure.) 

Obs, — This sauce is exceedingly good when mixed with the brown 
gravy of a hash or stew, or with that which is served with game or 
other dishe&

salt, nearly as much pep|>er, two tablespoonsfhl of water, and three of 
good sharp vinegar. Btyil the sauce for a few minutes, fuid serve it 
not; or send it to table cold, when it is liked sa Vinegar may en- 
tirely supply the place of the water in this case, and a spoonful or two 
of oil may be mixed with it. A small desertspoonful of minced parsley 
is likewise sometimes mixed with the onions. Their strong flavour 
may be in some measure weakened by steeping them for an hour or 
more in a pint of cold water after they are minc^ 

BALLAD DRB88INO. 

For a salad of moderate size pound very smoothly the yolks of tvro 
hard-boiled eggs with a small teaspoonful of unmade mustard, half as 
much sugar in fine powder, and a saltspoonful of salt. Mix gradually 
with these a small cup of cream, or the same quantity of very pure oil, 
and two tablespoonsfiil of vinegar. More salt and acid can he added at 
pleasure; but the latter usually predominates too much in English 
salads. A few drops of cayenne vinegar will improve this receipt 

Hard yolks of eggs, 2; unmade mustard, 1 small teaspoonful; sugar, 
half as much; salt, 1 saltspoonful; cream or oil, small cupful; vinegar, 
2 tablespoonsful. 

Obs, 1. — ^To some tastes a teaspoonful or more of eschalot vinegar 
would be an acceptable addition to this sauce, which may be otherwise 
varied in numberless ways. Cucumber-vinegar mav be substituted for 
other, and small quantities of soy, cavice, essence of anchovies, or cat- 
sup may in turn be used to flavour the compound. The salad-bowl too 
may be rubbed with a cut clove of garlic, to give the whole composition 
a very slight flavour of it The eggs should be boiled for fifteen 
minutes, and allowed to become quite cold alwavs before they are 
pounded, or the mixture will not be smooth: if it should curdle, which 
it will sometimes do, if not carefully made, add to it the yolk of a very 
fresh unboiled egg, 

Obs, 2. — As we have before had occasion to remark, garlic, when 
very sparingly and judiciously used, imparts a remarkably fine savour 
to a sauce or gravy, and neither a strong nor a coarse one, as it does 
when used in larger quantities. The veriest morsel (or, as the French 
call it, a mere sowpqon) of the root is sufficient to give this agreeable 
piquancy, but unless the proportion be extremely small, the effect will 
Be quite different The Italians dress their salads upon a round of deli- 
cately toasted bread, which is rubbed with garlic, saturated with oil, 
and sprinkled with cayenne, before it is laid into the bowl : they also 
eat the bread thus prepared, but with less of oil, and untoasted oflen be- 
fore their meals, as a digestor. 

FAENCH SALAD DRESSING. 

Stir a saltspoonful of salt and half as much pepper into a large spoon- 
ful of oil, and when the salt is dissolved, mix with them four additional 
q)oonsful of oil, and pour the whole over the salad ; let it be well turned, 
and then add a couple of spoonsful of vinegar ; mix the whole thoroughly 
and serve it without delay. .The salad should not be dressed in this 
way until the instant before it is wanted for table : the proportions of 
salt and pepper can be increased at pleasure, and common, or cucumber 
vinegar may be substituted for the tarragon, which, however is more 
frequently used in France than any other

OUR OWN SAUCB FOR SALAD OR COLD MEAT. 

Mix with the yolks of two very fresh unboiled eggs a haH-saltspoon- 
ful of salt, a third as much of cayenne, and a slight grating of nutmeg; 
then stir very gradually to them three tablespoonsfuT of oil of the finest 
quality working the sauce like the Mayonnaise ; and when it is per- 
fectly smooth, add three spoonsful of good meat-jelly, and two of cucum- 
ber-vinegar. The shin of beef stock ror gravies, wnich will be strongly 
jellied when cold, will answer very well fi)r this sauce when no richer 
18 at haitd. 

MAYONNAISE ; (a Very fine sauce for CQld meat, poultry, fish, or salad.") 

Put into a larg[e basin the yolks only of two fine and very fresh eggs, 
carefully freed n*om the germs, with a little salt and cayenne ; stir 
these well together, then luld about a teaspoonful of the purest salad 
oil, and work the mixture round with a wooden spoon until it appears 
like cream. Pour in by slow degrees nearly half a pint of oiJ, cbn- 
tinuing at each interval to work the sauce as at first until it resumes 
the smoothness of a custard, and not a particle of the oil remains visi- 
ble ; then add a couple of tablespoonsful of plain or of tarragnon vine- 
gar, and one of cold water to whiten the sauce. A bit of clear veal 
jelly the size of an eggr will improve it greatly; and a morsel of garlic 
not larger tiian a pea, bruised as fine as possible, will give it a very 
agreeable relish, even to persons to whom garlic genenulv is distaste- 
ful. In lieu of this, a few drops of eschalot vinegar may oe stirred in ; 
and the flavour may be varied with lemon-juice, and cucumber, or Chili 
vinegar at choice. The reader who may have a prejudice against the 
unboiled eggs which enter into the composition of the Mayonnaise, will 
find that the most fastidious taste would not detect their being raw, if 
the sauce be well made ; and persons who dislike oil may partake of it 
in this form, without being aware of its presence, provided always that 
it be perfectly fresh, and pure in flavour, for otherwise it is easily per- 
ceptible. 

Y61ks of fresh unboiled eggs, 2 ; salt, ^ saltspoonful or rather more ; 
cayenue; oil, full third of pint; common, or tarragon vinegar, 2 table- 
spoonsful ; cold water, 1 tablespoonful ; garlic, morsel size of^ pea (or 
few drops of eschalot vinegar). Meat jelly (if at hand), size of an 
egg. 

Obs, — When a much larger proportion of vinegar is liked, a third 
yolk of egg should be used, or the sayce will be too thin. It is some- 
times coloured green with the juice of parsley, and other herbs. A 
spoonful or two of cold bechamel, or of good white sauce, is always an 
'mprovemeut to it 

FENNEL SAUCE. 

Strip from the stems, wash very clean, and boil quickly in salt and 
water until it is quite tender, a handfbl of young fennel ; press the 
water well from it, mince it very small, and mix it gradually with the 
quantity of melted butter required for table. 

Fennel, small handful : 10 minutes, or until quite tender. Melted 
butter, i to ^ pint; little salt 



CHAP. IV.3 8AUCE8. 106 

Ob$. — ^The French use good pale veal gravy thickened with floor 
and butter for this sauce. 

PARSLET AND BUTTER. 

Proceed exactly as for the fennel, but boil the parsley fbar or five 
minutes less ; and be careful to press the water from it thoroughly. For 
an improved sauce, substitute b^hamel or white melted butter ibr the 
common melted butter. 

Melted butter, or thickened veal gravy, third of pint ; parsley, boiled 
and minced, 1 dessertspoonfuL 

OOOeEBERRY SAUCE FOR MACKEREL. 

Cut the stalks and tops from half to a whole pint of quite young 
gooseberries, wash them well, just cover them with cold water and 
boil them very gently indeed until they are tender; drain them well, 
and mix with them a small quantity of melted butter made with rather 
less flour than usual. Some eaters prefer the mashed ffooseberries 
without any addition ; others like that of a little ginger. The best way 
of making this sauce is to turn the gooseberries mto a hair-sieve to 
drain, then to press them through it with a wooden spoon, and to stir 
them in a clean stewpan or saucepan over the fire with from half to a 
whole teaspoonfiil of sugar, just to soften their extreme acidity, and a 
bit of fresh butter about the size of a walnut. When the fruit is not 
passed through the sieve it is an improvement to seed it 

COMMON SORREL SAUCE. 

Strip from the stalks and the large fibres, from one to a couple of 
quarts of freshly-gathered sorrel ; wash it very clean, and put it into a 
well-tinned stewpan or saucepan (or into a German enamelled one, 
which would be far better), without any water ; add to it a small slice 
of good butter, some pepper and salt, and stew it gently, keeping it well 
stirred, until it is exceedingly tender, that it may not burn ; then drain 
it on a sieve, or press the liquid well from it ; chop it as fine as possi- 
ble ; and boil it again for a few minutes with a spoonful or two of 
gravy, or the same quantity of cream or milk, mixed with a half-tea* 
spoonful of flour, or with only a fresh slice of good butter. The beaten 
yolk of an egg or two stirred in just as the sorrel is taken from the file 
will soflen the sauce greatly, and a saltspoonftil of pounded sugar will 
also be an improvement 

ASPARA.OUS SAUCE, FOR LAMB CHOPS. 

Cut the green tender points of some young asparagus into half-inch 
lengths, wash them well, drain and throw them into plenty of boiling 
salt and water. When they are quite tender, which may be in from 
ten to fifleen minutes, turn them into a hot strainer and drain the water 
thoroughly from them ; put them, at the instant of serving, into half a 
pint of thickpned veal gravy (see Sauce Tournee), mixed with the 
yolks of a couple of eggs, and well seasoned with salt and cayenne, or 
white pepper ; or, into an equal quantity of good melted butter : add to 
tliis last a squeeze of lemon-juice. The aspara^s will become yellow 
if reboiled, or if left long in the sauce before it is served.

GREEN MINT 8AVCB, FOR R048T LAMB. 

The mint for this sance should be fresh and young, for the leaves 
when old are tough. Strip them from the stems, wash them with great 
nicety, and drain them on a sieve or dry them in a cloth. Chop them 
very fine, put them into a sauce-tureen, and to three heaped tabl^ 
spoonsfu] of the mint add two of pounded sugar ; mix them well, and 
then add ^dually six tablespoonsful of ^od vinegar. The sauce 
made tlius is excellent, but Lisbon sugar can be used for it when pre- 
ferred, and all the proportions can be varied to the taste. It is com- 
mon! v served too liquid, and not sufficiently sweetened ; and it will be 
found much more wholesome, and generally &r more palatable made by 
this receipt. 

Young mint minced, 3 heaped tablespoonsful ; pounded sugar, 2 ta- 
blespoonsfbl ; vinegar, 6 tablespoonsful. 

CAPER aAUCS. 

Stir into the third of a pint of good melted butter from three to Ibur 
dessertspoonsful of capers ; add a little of the vinegar, and dish the 
sauce as soon as it boils. Keep it stirred after the berries are added : 
part of them may be minced, and a little Chili vinegar substituted fi>r 
their own. Pickled nasturtiums make a very good sauce, and their fla- 
vour is sometimes preferred to that of the capers. For a large joint, 
increase the quantity of butter to half a pint 

Melted butter, third of pint; capers, 3 to 4 dessertspoonsfliL 

BROWN CAPER 8AUGE. 

Thicken half a pint of good veal or beef jrravy as directed' fer Sauce 
Tournee, and add to it two tablespoonsful of^apers, and a dessertspoon- 
ful of the pickle liquor, or of Chili vinegar, with some cayenne if the 
former be used, and a proper seasoning of salt 

Thickened veal, or beef gravy, ^ pint; capers, 2 tablespoonsful;

CAPER SAUCE FOR FISH. 

To nearly half a pint of very rich melted butter add six spoonsful of 
Strang veal ^vy or jelly, a tablespoonful of essence of anchovies, and 
some Chili vmegar or cayenne. When there is no gravy at hand siib- 
stitute a half wineglassful of mushroom catsup, or of Harvey's sauc^; 
though these deepen the colour more than is desirable. ^ 

COMMON CUCUMBER SAUCE. 

Pare, slice, dust slightly with pepper, and with flour, two or three 
young cucumbers, and fry them a fine brown, in a little butter, or dis- 
solve an ounce and a half in a small stewpan, or iron saucepan, and 
shake them in it over a brisk fire from twelve to fifteen minutes ; pour 
to them, by degrees, nearly half a pint of strong beef broth, or of brown 
gravy ; add salt, and more pepper if required ; stew the whole for ^\e 
minutes, and send the sauce very hot Ho table. A minced onion may 
be browned with the cucumbers when it is liked, and a spoonful of vine- 
gar added to them before they are served. 



CHAP. IV.3 iULVCEB. 107 

Ciicambers, 2 or 3 ; batter, li oz. ; broth or gravy, nearly i pint, salt, 
pepper. 

ANOTHER COMMON SAUCE OF CUCUMBERS. 

Cucumbers which have the fewest seeds are best for this sauce. Pare 
and slice a couple, or three, should they be small, and put them into a 
saucepan, m which two ounces, or rather more, of butter have been dis- 
solved, and are beginning to boil ; place them high over the fire, that 
they may stew as soflly as possible without taking colour, for three- 
quarters of an hour, or longer ^ould they require it; add to them a good 
seasoning of white pepper, and some salt, when they are half done, and 
just before they are served stir to them half a teaspoonful of fiour, mixed 
with a morsel of butter ; stew in some minced parsley, give it a boil, 
and finish with a spoonful of good vinegar. 

WHITE CUCUMBER SAUCE. 

Quarter some young quickly grown cucumbers, without many seeds 
in them ; empty them of these, and take ofi^ the rinda Cut them into 
inch lengths, and boil them from fifteen to eighteen minutes in salt and 
water ; squeeze, and work them through a sieve ; mix them with a few 
spoonsful of bechamel, or thick white sauce ; do not let them boil a^in, 
but serve them very hot. A sauce of better flavour is made by boiling 
the cucumbers in veal gravy well seasoned, and stirring in the beaten 
yolks of two or three eggs, and a little vinegar or lemon-juice, at tbe 
mstant of serving. AnoUier also of cucuml^rs sliced, and stewed in 
batter, but without being at all browned, and then boiled in pale veal 
gravy, which must be thickened with rich cream, is excellent. A mor" 
set of sugar improves this sauce.

WHITE MUSHROOM SAUCE. 

Cut ofi'the stems closely from half a pint of small button mushrooms; 
clean them with a little salt and a bit of flannel, and throw them into 
cold water, slightly salted, as they are done ; drain them well, or dry 
them in a soft cloth, and throw them into half a pint of boiling bechamel 
(see page 93), or of white sauce made with very fresh milk, or thin 
cream, thickened with a tablespoonful of flour, and two ounces of butter. 
Simmer the mushrooms from ten to twenty minutes, or until they are 
quite tender, and dish the sauce, which should be properly seasoned 
with salt, mace, and cayenne. 

Mushrooms, ^ pint; white sauce, ^ pint; seasoning of salt, mace, and 
cayenne : 10 m mutes. 

ANOTHER MUSHROOM SAUCE. 

Prepare firom half to a whole pint of very small mushroom-buttons 
with great nicety, and throw them into as much sauce toumee ; when 
they are tender add a few spoonsful of rich cream, give the whole a 
boiC and serve it Either of these sauces may be sent to table with 
boiled poultry, breast of veal, or veal-cutlets: the sauce toumee should 
be thickened raUier more thim usual when it is to be used in this re- 
ceipt. 

Mushrooms and sauce toumee each, i to whole pint : stewed till ten* 
der. Cream, 4 to 8 tablespoonsful.

BROWN MV8HROOM 8AVCB. 

Veijr small flaps, peeled and freed entirely from the fur, will answer 
ibr this sauce. Leave them whole, or quarter them, and stew tliem 
tender in some rich brown gravy ; give a full seasoning of mace and 
cayenne, add thickening, and salt if needed, and a tablespoonful of 
good mushroom catsup. ^ 

COMMON TOMATA SAUCE. 

Tomatas are so juicy when ripe, that they require but little liquid to 
reduce them to a proper consistency for sauce ; and they vary so ex- 
ceedingly in size and quality that it is difficult to give precise direc- 
tions for the exact quantity which is needed for them. Take off the 
stalks, halve tlie tomatas, and gently squeeze out the seeds and wa- 
tery pulp ; then stew them softly with a few spoonsful of gravy of of 
strong broth until they are quite melted. Press the whole through a 
hairnsieve, and heat it afresh with a little additional gravy should it be 
too thick, and some cayenne, and salt Serve it very hot 

Fine ripe tomatas, 6 or 8 ; gravy or strong broth, 4 tablespoonsful : i 
to } hour, or longer if needed. Salt and cayenne sufficient to season 
the sauce, and two or three spoonsful more of gravy if required. 

Obs. — For a large tureen of this sauce, increase the proportions ; and 
should it be at first too liquid, reduce it by quick boiling. When nei- 
ther gravy nor broth is at hand, the tomatas may be stewed perfectly 
tender, but very ffently, in a couple of ounces of butter, with some cay- 
enne and salt only, or with the addition of a very little finely minced 
onion; then rubbed through a sieve, and heated, and servea without 
any addition, or with only that of a teaspoonful of vinegar; or, when 
the colour is not a principal consideration, with a few spooneful of rich 
cream, smoothly mixed with a little flour to prevent its curdling. The 
sauce must be stirred without ceasing should the last be added, and 
boiled for four or ^ve minute& 

A FINER TOMATA SAUCE. 

Stew very gently a dozen fine red tomatas, prepared as for the pre- 
ceding receipt, with two or three sliced eschalots, four or five chilies, 
or a capsicum or two, or in lieu of either, with a quartcr-teaspoonful of 
cayenne pepper, a few small dice of lean ham, and half a cupful of rich 
gravy. Stir these oflen, and when the tomatas are reduced quite to a 
smooth pulp, press them through a sieve ; put them into a clean sauce- 
pan, with a few spoonsfiil more of rich gravy, or Espaguole, add salt, 
if needed, boil the sauce, stirring it well, for ten minutes, and serve it 
very hot When the gravy is exceedingly good, and highly flavoured, 
the ham may be omitted : a dozen small mushrooms, nicely cleaned, 
may also be sliced, and stewed with the tomatas, instead of the escha- 
lots, when their flavour is preferred, or they may be added with them. 
The exact proportion of liquid used is immaterial, for ^ould the sauce 
be too thin, it may be reduced by rapid boiling, and diluted with more 
gravy if too thick. 

BOILED APPLE SAUCE. 

Apples of a fine cooking sort require but a very small portion of 
liquid to boil down well and smoothly for sauce, if placed over a gentle 
fire in a closoHE^uttiog saucepan, and simmered as softly as possible, 



CHAP. IT.] BAIICXf . 10b 

antil they are well broken ; and their fiavoor ii injared by the eommon 
mode of adding so much to them, that the greater part must be d^ined 
off again before they are sent to table. Pare tfaye fruit quickly, quarter 
it, and be careful entirely to remove the cores ; put one tablespoonful 
of water into a saucepan before the apples are thrown in ; and proceed, 
as we have directed, to simmer them until they are nearly ready to 
serve : finish tiie sauce by the receipt which follows. 

Apples, i lb. ; water, 1 tablespoonfid ; stewed very softly: 90 to 00 
minutes. 

06«.— These proportions are sufficient only for a small tureen of the 
sauco, and should be doubled for a large one. 

BAKXD APPLE SAUCE; (gOod,) 

Put a tablespoonful of water into a quart basin, and fill it with good 
boiling apples, pared, quartered, and carefully cored : put a plate over, 
and set them into a moderate oven for about an hour, or until they are 
reduced quite to a pulp ; beat them smooth with a clean wooden spoon, 
adding to them a little sugar, and a morsel of fresh butter, when thesf 
are liked, though they will scarcely be required. 

The sauce made thus is &r superior to that which is boiled. When 
no other oven is at hand, a Dutch or an American one would answer 
for it 

Good boiling apples, 1 quart: baked, 1 hour (more or less according 
to the quality of the fruit, and temperature of the oven) ; sugar, 1 oz. ; 
butter, i oz. 

BROW^ APPLE 8ADCE. 

Stew gently down to a thick and perfectly smooth marmalade, a 
pound of pearmains, or of any other well-flavoured boiling apples, in 
about the third of a pint of rich brown gravy : season the sauce rather 
highly with black pepper or cayenne, and serve it very hot Currie 
sauce will make an excellent substitute for the gravy when a very 
piquante accompaniment is wanted for pork or other rich meats. 

Apples pared and cored, 1 lb. ; good brown gravy, third of pint : | to 
H hour. Pe{^r or cayenne as needed. 

WHITE ONION SAUCE. 

Strip the skin from some large white onions, and after having taken 
off the tops and roots, cut them in two, throw them into cold water as 
they are done, cover them plentifully with more, and boil them very 
tender ; lift them out, drain, and then press the water thoroughly from 
them ; chop them small, rub them through a sieve or strainer, put them 
into a little rich melted butter, mixed with a spoonful or two of cream 
or milk, add a seasoning of salt, give the sauce a boil, and serve it very 
hot Portugal onions, when they can be obtained, are superior to any 
others, both for this and for most other purposes of cookery. 

For the finest kind of onion sauce, see Soubi$e^ below. 

BBOWN ONION SAUCE. 

Cut off both ends of the cmions, and slice them into a saucepan in 

which two ounces €^ butter have been dissolved ; keep them stewing

Peel some fine white onions, and trim away all tough and discoloured 
parts ; mince them small, and throw them into plenty of boiling water; 
when they have boiled quickly for five minutes, drain them well in a 
sieve, then stew them very softly indeed in an ounce or two of firesh 
butter, until thev are dry and perfectly tender ; stir to them as much 
bechamel as will brinfi^ them to the consistency of very thick peas soup, 
pass the whole through a strainer, pressing the onion stronofly that none 
may remain behind, and heat the sauce afresh, without allowing it to 
boil. A small half-teaspoonful of pounded sugar is sometimes added to 
this soubise. 

White part of onions, 2 lbs. : blanched 5 minutes. Butter, 2 ozs. : 
SO to 50 minutes. . Bechamel, j to 1 pint, or more. 

Obs, — These sauces are served more particularly with lamb or mut- 
ton cutlets, than with any other meats ; but they would probably find 
many approvers if sent to table with roast mutton, or boiled veal. Half 
the quantity given above will be sufficient for a moderatensized dish. 

A FIHB SAUCE, OK PUREE OF YBQETABLB MARROW. 

Pare one or two half grown marrows and cut all the seeds; take a 
pound of the vegetable, and slice it with one ounce of mild onion, into a 
pint of strong veal broth or of pale gravy ; stew them very sofUy for 
nearly or quite an hour ; add salt and cayenne, or white pepper, when 
they are nearly done ; press the whole through a fine and delicately 
clean hair-sieve ; heat it afresh, and stir to it when it boils about the 
third of a pint of rich cream. Serve it with boiled chickens, stewed or 
boiled veaJ, lamb cutlets, or any other delicate meat When to be 
served as a puree, an additional half pound of the vegetable must be used; 
and it should be dished with small fried sippets round it For a maigre 
dish, stew the marrow and onion quite tender in butter, and dilute then* 
with half boiling water and half cream. 

Vegetable marrow, 1 lb ; mild onion, 1 oz. ; strong broth or pale

EXCELLENT TURNIP, OR ARTICHOKE SAUCE FOR BOILED MEAT. 

Pat^, slice, and boil quite tender, some finely-grained mild turnips^ 
press the water from them thoroughly, and pass them through a sieve. 
Dissolve a slice of butter in a clean saucepan, and stir to it a large tea- 
spoonful of flour, or mix them smoothly together before they are put in, 
and shake the saucepan round until they boil ; pour to them very gra- 
dually, nearly a pint of thin cream (or of good milk mixed with a por* 
tion « cream,) add the turnips with a hal^teaspoonfid or more of salt.

and when the whole is well mixed and very hot, poor it over bcMled 
mutton, veal, lamb, or poultry. There should be sufficient of the sauce 
to cover the meat entirely, and when properly made it improves greatly 
the appearance of a joint A little cayenne tied in a muslin may be 
boiled in the milk before it is mixed with the turnips. Jerusalem arti- 
chokes make a more delicate sauce of this kind even than turnips ; the 
weight of both vegetables must be taken after they are pared. 

Pared turnips or artichokes, 1 lb. ; fresh butter, 1^ oz. ; flour, 1 large 
teaspoonful (twice as much if all milk be used) ; salt, ^ teaspoonful or 
more ; cream, or cream and milk mixed, from j to 1 pint 

CELERY SAUCE. 

Slice the white part of from three to five heads of young tender 
celery ; peel it if not very y lung, and boil it in salt and water for twenty 
minutes. If for white sauce, put the celery, after it has been well 
drained, into half a pint of veal broth or gravy, and let it stew until it is 
quite soft; then add an ounce and a half of butter, mixed with a des- 
sertspoonful of flour, and a quarter-pint of thick cream, or the yolks of 
three eggs. The IVench, after boilmg the celery, which they cut very 
small, for about twenty minutes, drain, and chop it ; then put it with a 
slice of butter into a stewpan, and season it with pepper, salt, and nut- 
meg ; they keep these stirred over the fire for two or three minutes, 
and then dredge in a dessertspoonful of flour ; when this has lost its raw 
taste, they pour in a sufficiency of white gravy to moisten the celery, 
and to allow for twenty minutes' longer bouing. A very good common 
celery sauce is made by simply stewing the celery, cut into inch-lengths, 
in butter, until it begins to be tender; and then adding a spoonful of 
flour, which must be allowed to brown a little, and half a pint of good 
broth or beef gravy, with a seasoning of pepper or cayenne. 

Celery, 3 to 5 heads: 20 minutes. Veal broth, or gravy, } pint: 20 
to 40 minutes. Butter, 1^ oz. ; flour, 1 dessertspoonful ; cream, i pint, 
or three yolks of eggs. 

SWEET PUDDING SAUCE. 

Boil together for fifteen minutes the thin rind of half a small lemon, 
an ounce and a half of fine sugar, and a wineglaasful of water; then 
take out the lemon-peel, and mix very smoothly an ounce of butter 
with rather more than a half-teaspoonful of flour, stir them round in the 
eauce utitil it has boiled one minute ; next add a wineglassful and a 
half of sherry or Madeira, or two thirds of that quantity and a quarter- 
glass of brandy : when quite hot, serve the sauce. 

Port^wine sauce is made in the same way, with the addition of a des- 
sertspoonfijl of lemon-juice, some grated nutmeg, and a little more 
sugar : orange rind and juice may be used to give it flavour when pre- 
ferred to lemon. 

Rind i lemon; sugar, 1} oz. ; water, 1 wineglassful: 15 minutes. 
Butter, 1 oz. ; flour, large ^ teaspoonful: 1 minute. Wine, !§ wine^ 
glassful; or, 1 of wine, and i glass of brandy. 

PUNCH SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINOa. 

This is a favourite sauce with custard, plain bread, and plum-pud 
dings. With two ounces of sugar and a quarter-pint ^f water, boil 
very gently the rind of half a small lemon, and somewhat less of orange-

COMMON PUDDING SAUCE. 

Sweeten a quarter-pint of good melted butter with an ounce and a 
half of su^r, and add to it gradually a couple of glasses of wine ; stir 
it until it IS at the point of filing, and serve it immediately. Lemon- 
grate, or nutmeg, can be added at pleasure. 

«A DELICIOUS GERMAN PUDDING SAUCE. 

Dissolve in half a pint of sherry or of Madeira, from three to four 
ounces of fine sugar, but do not allow the wine to boil ; stir it hot to 
the well-beaten yolks of six fresh eg^ and mill the sauce overs gentle 
fire until it b well thickened and highly frothed ; pour it over a plum, 
or any other kind of sweet boiled pudding, of which it much improves 
the appearance. Half the quantity will be sufficient for one of mode- 
rate size. A small machine, resembling a chocolate mill, is used in 
Germany for frotliing this sauce ; but a couple of silver fi>rk6, fiistened 
together at the handles, will serve for the purpose, on an emergency. 
We fecommend the addition of a dessertspoonful of strained lemon- 
juice to the wine. 

For large pudding, sherry or Madeira, J pint ; fine sugar, 3 to 4 ozs. ; 
yolks of eggs, 6; lemon-juice (if added), 1 dessertspoonfiil. 

Obs. — The safer plan with sauces liable to curdle is to thicken them 
always in a jar or jug, placed in a saucepan of water ; when this is not 
done, they should be held over the fire, but never placed upon it 

PARSILET-OEBEN, FOB COLOURING SAUCES. 

(rather a quantity of young parsley, strip it firom the stalks, wash it 
very ctean, shake it as dry as possible in a cloth, pound it in a mortar, 
press al! the juice closely from it through a hair-sieve reversed, and put 
it into a clean jar; set it into a pan of boiling water, and in about three 
minutes, if gently simmered, the juice will be poached sufficiently ; lay 
it then upon a clean sieve to drain, and it will be ready for use. 

TO CRISP PARSLEY. 

Pick some branches of ^oung parsley, wash them well, drain them 
from the water, and swing them in a clean cloth until they are quite 
dry ; place them on a sheet of writing paper in a Dutch oven, before a 
brisk fire, and keep them frequently turned until they are quite crisp. 
They will be done in from six to eight minutes. 

FRIED PARSLEY. 

When the parsley has been prepared as for crisping, and is mtUe 
dry, throw it into plenty of lard or butter, which is on the point of boil 



CHAP. IV.3 SAUCES. lis 

\ng ; take it up with a skimmer the instant it is crisp, and drain it on a 
cloth spread upon a sieve reversed, and placed before the fire. 

TARTAR MUSTARD. 

Rub four ounces of the best mustard very smooth with a full tea^ 
spoonful of salt, and wet it by degrees with strong horseradish vinegar, 
a dessertspoonftil of cayenne or of Chili vinegar, and one or two of tar- 
ragon vinegar, when its flavour is not dislikml. A quarter-pint of vin^ 
gar poured boiling upon an ounce of scraped horseradish, and left &t 
one night, closely covered, will be ready to use for this mustard, but it 
will be better for standing two or three days. 

Mustard,. 4 ozs. ; salt, large teaspoonful ; cayenne, or Chili vinegar, 
1 dessertspoonful; horseradish vinegar, third of'^pint. 

Obs. — ^This is an exceedingly pungent compound, but has many 
admirers. 

ANOTHER TARTAR MVSTARD. 

Mix the salt and mustard smoothly, with equal parts of horseradish 
vinegar and of common vinegar. Mustard made by these receipts will 
keep long, if put into jars or bottles, and closely stopped. Cucumber, 
eschalot, or any other of the flavoured vinegars for which we liave 
given receipts, may in turn be used for it, and mushroom, gherkin, or 
India pickle-liquor, likewise. 

HILD MUSTARD. 

Mustard for instant use should be mixed with milk, to which a spoon- 
ful or two of very thin cream may be added. 

MUSTARD THE COMMON WAT. 

The great art of mixing mustard, is to have it perfectly smooth, and 
of a proper consistency. The liquid with which it is moistened should 
be added to it in small quantities, and the mustard should be well nibbed, 
and beaten with a spoon. Mix a half teaspoonful of salt with two 
ounces of the flour of mustard, and stir to them by degrees, sufficient 
boiling water to reduce it to the appearance of a thick batter ; do not 
put it into the mustard-glass until cold. Some persons like a half-tear 
spoonful of sugar, in the finest powder, mixed with it It ought to be 
sufficiently diluted always to drop easily from the spoon. 

VRENCH BATTER ; (for frying vegetables, and frit apple, peach, or orange 

fritters.) 

Cut a couple of ounces of good butter into small bits, pour on it less 
than a quarter-pint of boiling water, and when it is dissolved, add three 
quarters of a pint of cold water, so that the whole shall 'not be quite 
milk warm ; mix it then by degrees, and very smoothly, with twelve 
ounces of fine dry flour, and a small pinch of salt, if the batter be for 
fruit fritters, but with more if for meat or vegetables. Just before it is 
used, stir into it the whites of two eggs beaten to a solid froth ; but pre- 
viously to this, add a little water should it appear too thick, as somv 
flour requires more liquid than other, to bring it to the proper con- 
sistency. 

Butter, 2 ozs.; water, fix>m | to nearly 1 pint; little salt; flour, J lb.*: 
whites of 2 eggs, beaten to snow.

TO P&SPARB BREAB FOR nHYIlfO FIBH. 

Cut thick slices from the middle of a loaf of light biead^ pare the 
crust entirely from them, and dry them gradually in a cool oven until 
they are crisp quite through ; let them become cold, then roll or beat 
them into fine crumbs, and keep them in a dry place for use. To strew 
over hams or cheeks of bacon, the bread should be left all night in the 
oven, which should be sufficiently heated to brown, as well as to harden 
it : it ought indeed to be entirely converted into equally-coloured cnist 
It may 1^ silted through a dredging-boz on to the hams, after it has 
been reduced almost to powder. 

BROWNED FLOUR FOR THICKENING SOUPS AND GRAVIES. 

Spread it on a tin or dish, and colour it without burning, in a gentle 
ovon« or before the fire in a Dutch or American oven : turn it often, or 
the edges will be too much browned before the middle is enough sa 
This, blended with butter, makes a convenient thickening for soups or 
gravies, of which it is desirable to deepen the colour ; and it requires 
fees time and attention than the French rotuc of page 92. 

FRIED BREAD-CRUIIBS. 

Crrate lightly into very tine crumbs four ounces of stale bread, and 
shake them through a cullender, without rubbing or touching them with 
the hands. Dissolve two ounces of fresh butter in a frying-pan, throw 
in the crumbs, and stir them constantl^i over a moderate fire, until they 
are all of a clear gold colour; lift them out with a skimmer, spread 
them on a soft cloth laid upon a sieve reversed, and dry them before the 
fire. They may be more delicately prepared by browning them in a 
gentle oven without the addition of butter. 

Bread, 4 ozs. ; butter, 2 ozs. 

FRIED BREAD, OR SIPPETS OF BREAD FOR OARNISHINO. 

Cut the crumb of a stale loaf in slices a quarter-inch thick: form 
them into diamonds, or half diamonds, or shape them with a paste-cut- 
ter in any other wav ; fry them in fresh butter, some*of a very pale 
brown, and others a deeper colour : dry them well, and place them al- 
ternately round tlie dish that is to be garnished. They may be made to 
adhere to the edge of the dish, when they are required for ornament 
only, by means of a little flour and white of egg brushed over the side 
which .is placed on it: tliis must be allowed to dry before they are 
served. 

THE RAJAH^S SAUCE. 

Strain, very clear, the juice of six fine lemons; add to it a small tea- 
spoouful of salt, a drachm of good cayenne-pepper, and a slight strip or 
two of the lemon-rind cut extremely thin. Give the sauce three or 
four minutes simmering: turn it into a China jug or basin; and when 
it IS quite cold, strain it again, put it into small dry bottles, cork 
them well, and store them in a cool place which is free from damp. 
The sauce is good without being boiled, but is apt to ferment after a 
time: it is, we think, of much finer flavour than Chili vinegar. 

Lemon-juice ^ pint; salt 1 smaU teaspoonful; cayenne 1 drachm; 
simmered 5 minutes.

CHAPTER V. 
STORE SAUCES. 

OBSERVATIONS. 

A wELL-selected stock of these will always prove a convenient r^ 
•oaroe for giving colour and flavour to soups, gravies, and made dishes ; 
but unless the consumption be considerable, they should not be over- 
abimdantly provided, as few of them are improved by age, and many are 
altogether spoiled by long keeping, especially if they be not perrectly 
secured from the air by sound corking, or if stored where there is the 
slightest degree of damp. To prevent loss, they should be examined at 
short intervals, and at the first appearance of mould or fermentation, 
such as will bear the process should be reboiled, and put, when again 
quite cold, into clean bottles ; a precaution often especially needful for 
mushroom catsup when it has been made in a wet season. This, with 
walnut catsup, Harvey's sauce, cavice, lemon-pickle, Chili, cucumber, 
and eschalot vinegar^ will b^ all that is commonly needed for family 
use, but there is at the present day an extensive choice of these stores 
on sale, in London, and should there be a demand for them in America, 
they could easily be procured. 

MUSHROOM CATSUP. 

Cut the ends of the stalks from two gallons of freshly-gathered mnsh- 
looms (the large flaps are best for this purpose, but they diould not be 
worm-eaten) ; break them into a deep ear&en pan, and strew amongst 
them three-quarters of a pound of salt, reserving die larger portion of it 
for the top. Let them stand %r three, or «ven four days, aod stir them 
gently once every four and twenty hours; then drain on (iie liquor with- 
out pressing the mushrooms; strain and measure it; put it into a very 
clean stewpan, and boil it qqickly until reduced nearly or quite half. 
For every quart, allow half an ounce of whole black pepper, and a 
drachm if mace ; or, instead of the pepper, a quarter-teaspoonful (ten 
grains) offfood cayenne ; pour the catsup into a clean jug or jar, lay a 
folded cloth over it, and keep it in a cool place until the following day; 
pour it gently from the sediment, put it into small bottles, cork them 
well, and rosin them down. A teaspoonful of salad-oil may be 'poured 
ioto each bottle before it is corked, the better to exclude liie aur from 
the catsup: it must be kept in a dry cool place. 

Mcieihrooms, 2firallons; salt, 4 lb.; to macerate three or four days. 
To each quart of liquor, i oz. black pepper, or quarter-teaspoonful cay- 
enne ; and 1 drachm mace : to be reduced half; 

Obs, 1. — Catsup made thus will not be too salt, nor will the flavour 
of the mushrooms be overpowered by tliat of the spices ; of which a 
larger quantity, and a greater variety, can be used at will. 

Obs. 2. — ^After the mushrooms have stood for three or four days, as 
we have directed, the whole may be turned into a large stewpan, brought 
slowly to a boil, and simmered for a few minutes before the liquor is 
strained off We think the catsup keeps rather better when this is 
done, but we recommend only just sufficient simmering to preserve it

well. When the muflhrooma are crushed, or mashed, as some authors 
direct, the liquor will necessarily be very thick ; it is better to proceed 
as above, ana then to boil the squeezings of ^e mushrooms with the 
sediment of the catsup^ and sufficient clov^ pcpper, allspice, and ginger, 
to flavour it highly : this second catsup will be round very useful to mix 
with common thickened sauces, hashes, and stewa In some seasons it 
is necessary to boil the catsup with the spice a second time after it has 
been kept for three or four months: this, by way of precaution, can 
always be done, but it had better then be put into large bottles in the 
first instance, and stored in the small ones afterwards. 

DOUBUE MUSHROOM CATSUP. 

On a gallon of fresh mushrooms strew three ounces of salt, and pour 
to them a quart of ready-made catsup (that which is a year old will do 
if it be perfectly good) ; keep these stirred occasionally for four days, 
then drain the liquor very dry from the mushrooms, and boil it for fifteen 
minutes, with an ounce of whole black pepper, a drachm and a half of 
mace, an ounce of ginger, and three or four grains only of cayenne. 

Mushrooms, 1 gallon ; salt, 3 ozs. ; musliroom catsup, 1 quart ; pepper- 
corns, 1 oz. ; mace, 1} drachm ; ginger, 1 oz. ; cayenne, 3 to 4 grains: 
15 minutes. 

COMPOUin), OR COOK*S CATSUP. 

Take a pint and a half of mushroom catsup when it is first made, and 
ready boiled (the double is best for the purpose), simmer in it for five 
minutes, an ounce of small eschalots or onions, nicely peeled ; add to 
these half a pint of walnut catsup, and a wineglassful of cayenne vine- 
gar,* or of Chili vinegar ; eive the whole one boO, pour it out, and when 
cold, bottle it with the eschalots. 

Mushroom catsup, 1^ piat; eschalots or onions, 1 oz. ; walnut catsup 
or pickle, ^ pint ; cayenne or Chili vinegar, 1 wineglassful. 

WALNUT CATSUP. 

The vinegar in which walnuts have been pickled, when they have 
remained in it a year, will generally answer all the purposes for which 
this catsup is required, particularly if it be drained fi-om them and boiled 
for a few minutes, with a little additional spice, and a few eschalots; 
but where the vinegar is objected to, it may be made by boiling either 
the expressed juice of young walnuts for an hour, with six ounces of 
fine anchovies, four ounces of eschalots, half an ounce of black pepper, 
a quarter ounce of cloves, and a drachm of mace, to every quart; or as 
follows ; — 

Pound in a mortar a hundred young walnuts, strewing amongst them 
as they are done half a pound of salt ; then pour to them a quart of 
strong vinegar, and let them stand until they have become quite black, 
keeping them stirred three or four times a day; next add a quart of 
strong old beer, and boil the whole together for ten minutes; strain it, 
and let it remain until the next day ; then pour it off clear from the 
sediment, add to it one large head of garlic bruised, half an ounce of 
nutmegs bruised, the same quantity of cloves and black pepper, and two 
drachms of mace : boil these together for half an hour, and the following

are thoroughly bruised and broken, and then put them into a stone iar, 
with half a pound of eschalots, cut in slices, one head of garlic, half a 
pound of salt, and two quarts of vinegar ; let them stand for ten days, 
and stir them night and morning. Strain off the liquor, and boil it for 
half an hour with the addition of two ounces of anchovies, two of whole 
pepper, half an ounce of cloves, and two drachms of mace; skim it well, 
strain it ofi; and when it is quite cold pour it gently fiom the sediment 
(which may be reserved for flavouring common sauces) into small dry 
bottles ; secure it from the air by sound corking, and store it in a d^ 
place.

LEMON PICKLE OR CATSUP. 

Either divide six small lemons into quarters, remove all the pips that 
are in sight, and strew three ounces of salt upon them, and keep them 
turned in it for a week, or, merely make deep incisions in them, and 
proceed as directed for pickled lemons. When they have stood in a 
warm place for eight davs, put into a stone jar two ounces and a half 
of finely scn^ied horseraaish, and two ounces of eschalots, or one and a 
half of garlic ; to these add the lemons with all their liquor, and pour on 
them a pint and a half of boiling >inegar in which half an ounce of 
bruised ginger, a quarter ounce of whole white pepper, and two blades 
of mace have been simmered (br two or three minutes. The pickle 
will be fit for use in two or three months, but may stand four or five 
before it is strained o£

FONTAC CATSUP FOR FISH. 

On one pint of ripe elderberries stripped from the stalks, pour three* 
quarters oi a pint of boiling vinegar, and let it stand in a coed oven aU 
night; the next day strain off the liquid without pressure, and boil it for 
five minutes with a half-teaspoonfi]l salt, a small race of dinger, a blade 
of mace, forty corns of pepper, twelve cloves, and four eschalots. Bottle 
it with the spice when it is quite cold. 

BOTTLED TOMATAS, OR TOMATA CATSUP. 

Cut half a peck of ripe tomatas into quarters ; lay them on diahe^ 



tl8 MOBBRK OOOSSKT. [CHAP. T. 

and sprinkle over them half a pound of salt The next day drain the 
juice frcMm them through a hair-sieve into a stewpan, and boil it half an 
hour with three dozens of small capsicums, and half a pound of escha- 
lots ; then add the tomatas, which should be ready pulped through a 
strainer. Boil the whole for thirty minutes longer ; have some clean 
bottles, kept warm by the fire, fill them with the catsup while it is quite 
hot ; cork, and rosin them down directly. 

Tomatas, ^ peck ; salt, ^ lb. ; capsicums, 3 doz. ; eschalots, ^ lb. : 
^ hour. After pulp is added, ^ hour. 

Obs, — This receipt has been kindly contributed by a person who 
makes by it every year large quantities of the catsup, which is consi- 
dered excellent : for sauce, it must be mixed with gravy or melted butp 
ter. We have not ourselves been able to make trial of it . 

EPIGUREAN 8AU0E. 

Mix well, by shaking them in a bottle « quarter pint of Indian soy, 
half a pint of Chili vinegar, half a pint of walnut catsup, and a pint and 
a half of Uie best mushroom catsup. These proportions make an excel- 
lent sauce, either to mix with melted butter, and to serve with fish, or 
to add to difiTerent kinds of gravy ; but they can be varied, or added to^ 
at pleasure. 

Indian soy, ^ pint; Chili vinegar, i pint; walnut catsup, i pint; 
mushroom catsup, 1^ pint. 

Obs. — ^A pint of port wine, a few eschalots, and some thin strips of 
leraon-rind will convert this into an admirable store-sauce. Less soy 
would adapt it better to many tastes. 

TARRAGON VINBOAB. 

Gather the tarragon just before it blossoms, which will be late in 
July, or early in August; strip it fi*om the larger stalks, and put it into 
small stone jars or wide-necked bottles, and in doing this twist some of 
the branches so as to bruise the leaves and wring them asunder; then 
pour in sufficient distilled or very pale vinegar to cover the tarragon ; 
let it infiise lor two months, or more : it will take no harm even by 
standing all the winter. When it 16 poured of^ strain it very clear, put 
it into small dry bottles, and cork them well. Sweet basil vinegar is 
made in exactly the same way, but it should not be left on the leaves 
more than three weeks. The jars or bottles should be filled to the neck 
with the tarragon before the vinegar is added : its flavour is strong and 
peculiar, but to many tastes very agreeable. It imparts quite a foreign 
character to the dishes for which it is used. 

GREEN MINT VINEGAR. 

Pick and sliffhtly chop, or bruise, fi-eshly-gathered mint, and put it 
into bottles; fill them nearly to the necks, and add vinegar as for tar* 
ragon : in forty days, strain it ofi; and bottle it for use. 

The mint itself; ready minced for sauce, will keep well in vinegar 
though the colour will not be very good. 

CUCUMBER VINEGAR. 

First wipe, and then, without paring, slice into a jar some young and 
quickly-grown encumbers; pour on them as much boilinff vinegar as 
will cover them well, with a teaspoonful of salt and two-thirds as much 



CHAP. IV.] VrORE MAVaSM. 119 

of peppercorns to the pint and a half of vinegar: it may xemain on 
them for a month, or even for two, if well defended from the air. A 
mild onion can be intermixed with the cucumbers, when its flavour is 
considered an improvement. 

CELERY VINEGAR. 

Put into a wide-necked bottle or pickle-jar eight ounces of the white 
part of the root and stalks of fine fresh celery cut into slices, and pour 
on it a pint of boiling vineffar; when a little cool, cork it down, and in 
three weeks it will be ready to strain, and to bottle for keeping. Half 
an ounce of bruised celery-seed will answer the same purpose, when the 
root cannot be obtained. This is an agreeable addition to a salad, 
when its flavour is much liked: a half-teaspoonful of salt should be 
boiled in it« 

ESCHALOT, OR GARLIC VINEGAR. 

On from four to six ounces of eschalots, or on two of garlic, peeled 
and bruised, pour a quart of the best vinegar ; stop the jar or bottle close, 
and in a fortnight or three weeks the vinegar may be strained off for 
ose: a few drops will give a sufficient flavour to a sauce, or to a tureen 
of gravy. 

Eschalots, 4 to 6 ozs. ; or, garlic, 2 to 4 ozs. ; vinegar, I quart : 15 to 
21 days. 

Obs, — ^These roots may be used in smaller or in larger proportion, as 
a slighter or a stronger flavour of them is desired, and may remain longer 
in the vinegar without any detriment to it 

ESCHALOT WINE. 

This is a fiir more useful preparation even than the preceding one, 
since it can be used to impart the flavour of the eschalot to dishes for 
which acid is not required. Peel and slice, or bruise, four ounces of 
eschalots, put them into a bottle, and add to them a pint of sherry ; in a 
fortnight pour off the wine, and should it not be strongly flavoured with 
the eschalots, steep in it two ounces more, for another fortnight ; a half- 
teaspoonful of cayenne may be added at first The bottle should be 
shaken occasionally, while the eschalots are infusing, but should remain 
undisturbed for the last two or three days, that the wine may be clear 
when it is poured off to bottle for keeping. Sweet-basil wine is made 
bj steeping the firesh leaves of the herb in wine, from ten to fifteen days, 
fischalots, 4 oza ; sherry 1 pmt : 15 days, or more. 

HORSERADISH VINEGAR. 

On four ounces of young and freshly-scraped horseradish pour a quart 
of boiling vinegar, and cover it down closely: it will be ready for use 
in three or four days, but may remain for weeks, or months, before the 
vinegar is poured off An ounce of minced eschalot may be substituted 
for one of tlie horseradish, if the flavour be liked. 

CAYENNE VINEGAR. 

Put from a quarter to half an ounce of the best cayenne pepper into 
a bottle, and pour on it a pint of pale vinegar. Cork it closely, and 
shake it well every two Of three days. It may remain any length o( 
time before it is poured ofl^ but will very soon be ready for use. ' From 
being so extremely pungent, it is, for some purposes, preferable to Chili

vinegur, as the cayenne seasoning can be men with less of acid. It 
may be made of any degree of strength. We warn the young^ house- 
keeper against using esssnoe ofemfennB (or cayenne steeped in brandy) 
for flavouring any dishes, as the brandy is very perceptible always, ana 
gives an exceedingly coarse taste. 

Good cayenne pepper, ^ to J oz.; vinegar, 1 pint: infuse &om 2 
weeks to 12 montn& 

UEMON brahdt; (Jarjlavouring sweet ilts&ef.) 

Fill any sized wide-necked bottle lightly with the very thin rinds of 
fresh lemons, and cover them with gool bmndy ; let them remain three 
weeks, then strain off the spirit and keep it well corked for use: a few 
apricoUkemels bkinched and infused with the lenion*rind will give an 
agreeable flavour. 

ANOTHBB STORE-FLAYOCRINO VOR PUDDINGS OR CAKBB. 

Rasp on from two to four ounces of sugar the rinds of a couple of fine 
lemons, reduce the lumps to powder, and add it gradually to, and pound 
it with, an ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and wiped very dry. 
When these have been beaten to a fine paste, and the whole is well 
blended, press the mixture mto a small pan, tie a paper over, and keep 
it for use. The proportions can be varied at pleasure, and the quanti- 
ties increased : from a teaspoonfiil to three times as much can be mixed 
with the ingredients for a pudding. Cakes require more in proportion 
to their size. 

Rinds large lemons, 2 ; sugar, 2 to 4 ozs. ; bitter almonds, 1 oz. 

DRIED MUSHROOMS. 

Peel small, sound, freshly-gathered flaps, cut oflTthe stems, and scrape 
out the fur entirely; then arrange the mushrooms singly on tins or 
dishes, and dry them as gradually as possible in a genUe oven. Put 
them, when they are done, into tin canisters, and store them where 
they will be secure from damp. French cooks give them a single boil 
in water, from which they then are well drain^, and dried, as usuaL 
When wanted for table, they should be put into cold gravy, slowly 
heated, and gently simmered, until they are tender. 

MUSHROOM POWDER. 

When the mushrooms have been prepared with great nicety, and 
dried, as in the foregoing receipt, pound them to a very fine powder; 
sift it, and put it immediately into small and perfectly dry bottles ; cork 
and seal them without delay, for if the powder be long exposed to the 
air, so as to imbibe any humidity, or if it be not well secured fh>m it in 
the bottles, it will be likely to become putrid: much of that which is 
purchased, even at the best Italian warehouses, is found to be so, and, 
as it is sold at a very high price, it is a great economy, as well as a 
surer plan, to have it carefully prepared at home. It is an exceedingly 
useful store, and an elegant addition to many dishes and sauces. To 
insure its being good, the mushrooms should be gathered in dry wea- 
thei; and if any addition of spices be made to the powder (some persons 
mix with it a seasoning of mace and cayenq^), they should be put into 
the oven for awhile before they are used : but even these precautions 
•vriil not be sufficient, unless the powder be stored in a very dry place 



OUAF. v.] 8T0BB tUOJCJUL 181 

after it is bottled. A teaspoonful df it* with ft quarter-piot of ftraof 
veal gravy, as much cream, and a small desserlBpoonfal of floiir» will 
make an excellent bechamel or white sauce. 

POTATO FLOUR ; (Feculc de Pornmet de terre,) 

Grate into a large vessel fbJl of cold water, six pounds of sound 
mealy potatoes, ana stir them well together. In six hours pour off the 
water, and add fresh, stirring the mixture well; repest this process 
every three or four hours duruig the day, change the water at night, 
and the next moming pour it off; put two or three quarts more to the 
potatoes, and turn them directly into a hairnsieve, set over a pan to 
receive the flour, which may then be washed through the sieve, by 
pouring water to it. Let it settle in the pan, drain off the water, spread 
the potato^diment on dishes, dry it in a slow oven, sift it, and put it 
into bottles or jars, and cork or cover them closely. The flour thus 
made will be beautifully white, and perfectly tasteless. It wDl remain 
good fi»r years. 

TO XAKS n4>17R or RICE. 

Take any quantity oi whole rice, wai^ it thoroughly, changing the 
water several times ; drain and press it in a cloth, then spread it on a 
dish, and dry it perfectly ; beat it in a mortar to a smooth powder, and 
sift it through a fine sieve. When used to thicken soup or sauces, mix 
it with a simdl quantity of cold water or of broth, and pour it to them 
while they are boiling. 

This flour, when newly made, is of much purer flavour than any 
Qsmdly prepared for sale. 

POWDER OF BJLYi^Y HERBS. 

All herbs which are to be dried for storing should be gathered in fine 
weather ; cleared firom dirt and decayed leaves ; and dried quickly, but 
without scorching, in a Dutch oven before the fire, or in any other that 
is not too much heated. The leaves should then be stripped firom the 
stalks, pounded, ^fled, and closely corked in separate bottles ; or several 
kinds may be mixed and pounded together for the convenience of sea- 
soning in an instant gravies, soujis, forcemeats, and made dishes : appn^ 
priate spices, celery-seed, and dried lemon-peel, all in fine powder, can 
be added to the herbs. 

THE DOOTOR*8 ZEST. 

Pound to the finest powder, separately, eight ounces of basket salt, a 
quarter-ounce of cayenne, a drachm of mace, and of nutmeg; of cloves 
and pimento, a drachm and a h&lf each ; then add the omer ingredi- 
ents, one by one, to the salt, and pound them together until they are 
perfectly well blended. Pat the zest into wide-mouthed phials, and 
cork them tightly. Half an ounce of mushroom-powder, and a drachm 
of dried lemon-peel, will greatly improve this mixture.

CHAPTER VI. 
FORCEMEATS. 

GENERAL REMARKS* 

The coarse and unpalatable compounds so constantly met with under 
the denomination of forcemeat, even at tables otherwise tolerably well 
served, show with how little attention they are commonly prepared. 

Many very indifferent cooks pique themselves on never doing any 
thing by rule, and the consequence of their throwing together at ran- 
dom (or **by guess" as they call it) the ingredients which ought to be 
proportioned with exceeding delicacy and exactness is, repeated failure 
m all they attempt to do. Long experience and a very correct eye 
may, it is true, enable a person to dispense occasionally with weights 
and measures, without hazarding the success of their operations ; but it 
is an experiment which the learner will do better to avoid. 

A large marble or Wedgwood mortar is indispensable in making all 
the finer kinds of forcemeat ; and equally so indeed for many other pur- 
poses in cookery ; no kitchen, therefore, should be without one ; and 
for whatever preparation it may be used, the pounding should be con- 
tinued with patience and perseverance until not a single lump nor fibre 
be perceptible in the mass of the articles beaten together. This parti- 
cularly applies to potted meats, which should resemble the smoothest 
paste ; as well as to several varieties of forcemeat Of these last it 
should be observed, that such as are made by the French method (see 
quenelles) are the most appropriate for an elegant dinner, either to 
serve in soups or to fill boned poultry of any Kind ; but when their 
exceeding lightness, which to foreigners constitutes one of their great- 
est excellencies, is objected to^ it may be remedied by substituting dry 
crumbs of bread for the panada, and pounding a small quantity of the 
lean of a boiled ham, with the other ingredients : however, this should 
be done only for the balls. 

No particular herb or spice should be allowed to predominate power- 
fiilly in these compositions; but the whole of the seasonings should be 
taken in such quantity only as will produce an agreeable savour when 
they are blended together. 

NO. 1. GOOD COMMON FORCEMEAT, FOR ROAST VEAL, TURKEYS, &C. 

Grate very lightly into exceedingly fine cnimbs, four ounces ^f the 
inside of a stale loaf,^and mix thoroughly with it, a quarter of an ounce 
of lemon-rind pared as thin as possible, and minced extremely small ; 
the same quantity of savoury herbs, of which two-thirds should be pars- 
ley, and one-third thyme, likewise finely minced, a little grated nut- 
meg, a half-teaspoonful of salt, and as much common pepper or cayenne 
as will season the forcemeat sufficiently. Break into these, two ounces 
of good butter in very small bits, add the unbeaten yolk of one egg, and 
with the fingers work the whole well together until it is smoothly 
mixed. It is usual to chop the lemon-rind, but we prefer it lightly 
grated on a fine grater. It should always be fresh for the purpose, or 
It will be likely to impart a very unpleasant flavour to the forcemeat 



CHAP, yi.3 FOBCEVEATS. 12B 

Half the rind of a moderate-sized lemon will be sufficient for this quan- 
tity ; which for a large turJiey must be increased one-half. 

iBread-crumbs, 4 ozs. ; lemon-rind, ^ oz. (or grated rind of i lemon) ; 
mixed savoury herbs, minced, ^ oz. ; salt, ^ teaspoonful ; pepper ^ to i 
of teaspoonful ; butter, 2 ozsl ; yolk, 1 egg. 

Obs, — ^This, to our taste, is a much nicer and more delicate force- 
meat than that which is made with chopped suet, and we would recom- 
mend it for trial in preference. Any variety of herb or spice may be 
used to give it flavour, and a little minced omon or eschalot can be add- 
ed to it also ; but these last do not appear to us suited to the meats for 
which the forcemeat is more particularly intended. Half an ounce of 
the butter may be omitted on ordinary occasions : and a portion of mar- 
joram or of sweet basil may take the place of part of the thyme and 
parsley when preferred to them. 

NO. 2. ANOTHER GOOD COMMON FORCEMEAT. 

Add to four ounces of bread-crumbs two of the lean of a boiled ham, 

Suite free from smew, and very finely minced ; two of good butter, a 
essertspoonful of herbs, chopped small, some lemon-e;rate, nutmeg, a 
little salt, a good seasoning of pepper or cayenne, and one whole e^g, 
or the yolks of two. This may be fried in balls of moderate size, Tor 
five minutes, to serve with roast veal, xx it may be put into the joint in 
the usual way. 

Bread-crumbs, 4 ozs. ; lean of ham, 2oz& ; butter, 2 ozs. ; minced herbs, 
1 dessertspoonful ; lemon-grate, 1 teaspoonful ; nutmeg, mace,and cay- 
enne, together, 1 small teaspoonful ; little salt ; 1 whole egg, or yolks of 2. 

NO. 3. SUPERIOR SUET FORCEMEAT, FOR VEAL, TURKXTt, &a 

Mix well together six ounces of fine stale crumbs, with an equal 
weight of beef-kidney suet, chopped extremely small, a large dessert- 
spoonful of parsley, mixed with ^ little lemon-thyme, a teaspoonful (^ 
salt, a quarter one of cayenne, and a saltspoonful or rather more of 
mace and nutmeg together ; work these up with three unbeaten egg- 
yolks, and three teaspoonsful of milk ; then put the forcemeat into a 
large mortar, and pound it perfectly smooth. Take it out, and let it 
remain in a cool place for half an hour at least before it is used : then roll 
it into balls, if it be wanted to serve in that form ; flour and fry them gen- 
tly from seven to eight minUtes, and dry them well before theyare dished. 

Beef suet finely minced, 6 ozs. ; bread-crumbs, 6 ozs. ; parsley, mixed 
with little thyme, 1 large dessertspoonful ; salt, 1 teaspoonfiil ; mace, 
large saltspoonful, and one-fourth as much cayenne ; unbeaten egg-yolks, 
3 ; milk, 3 teaspoonsful : well pounded. Fried in balls, 7 to 8 minutes, 
or poached, 6 to 7. 

Ohs. — The finely grated rind of half a lemon can be added to thui 
forcemeat at pleasure ; and for some purposes a morsel pf garlic, or 
three or four minced eschalots, may be mixed with it before it is put 
into the mortar. 

NO. 4 COMMON SUET FORCEMEAT. 

Beef suet is commonly used in the composition of this kind of force- 
meat, but we think that veal-kidney suet, when it could be obtained, 
would have a better efiect ; though the reader will easily comprehend 
that it is scarcely possible for us to have every variety of every receipt 



124 MODEBK COOKSRT. £cKAP. VI. 

which we insert put to the test : in some cases we are compelled mere- 
ly to suggest what appear to iis likely to be improvements. Strip care- 
fully every morsel of skin from the suet, and mince it small ; to six 
ounces add eiffht of bread-crumbs, with the same proportion of herbs, 
spice, salt, ami lemon-peel, as in the foregoing receipt, and a couple of 
whole eggs, which should be very slightly beaten, after the specks 
have been taken out with the point of a small fbrk. Should more liquid 
be required, the yolk of another egg^ or a spoonful or two of milk, may 
be used. Half this quantity will be sufficient for a small joint of veal, 
or for a dozen balls, which, when it is more convenient to serve it in 
that form, may be fried or browned beneath the roast, and then dished 
round it, though this last is not a very refined mode of dressing them. 
From eight to ten minutes will dry them well. 

NQ. 5. OYSTER FORCEMEAT. 

Open carefully a dozen fine plump natives, take ofi*the beards, strain 
their liquor, and rinse the oysters in it Grate four ounces of the crumb 
of a stale loaf into fine light crumbs, mince the oysters, but not too 
small, and mix them with the bread ; add an ounce and a half of good 
butter, broken into minute bits, the grated rind of half a small lemon, 
a small saltspoonful of pounded mace, some cayenne, a little salt, and a 
large teaspoonful of parsley: mix these ingredientB well, and work 
them together with the unbeaten yolk of one egg, and a little of the 
oyster liquor, the remainder of which can be add^ to the sauce which 
usually accompanies this forcemeat 

Oysters, 1 dozen ; bread-crumbs, 4 ozs. ; butter, 1} oz. ; rind i small 
lemon; mace, 1 saltspoonful; some cayenne and salt; minced parsley, 
1 krefO teaspoonful ; yolk 1 egg ; oyster-liquor, 1 dessertspoonful: rolled 
into balls, and fried firom 7 to 10 minutes, or poached from 5 to 6 
minutes. 

Obs, — In this forcemeat the flavour of the oysters should prevail 
entirely over that of all the other ingredients which are mixed with 
them. 

Na 6. ▲ FINER OTSTER FORCEMEAT. 

Pound the preceding forcemeat to the smoothest paste, with the addi- 
tion only of half an ounce of fre^ butter, should it be sufficiently dry to 
allow of it It is remarkably good when thus prepared, and may be 
poached or fried in balls for soups ot made dishes, or used to fill boned 
fowls, or the breasts of boiled turkeys with equally good effect 

NO. 7. MUSHROOM FORCEMEAT. 

Cut closely off the stems of some small, just-opened mushrooms, peel 
them, and take out the fur. Dissolve an ounce and a half of ^ood but- 
ter in a saucepan, throw them into it with a little cayenne, and a dight 
sprinkling of mace, and stew them softly, keeping them well ahaken, 
from five to seven minutes ; then turn them into a dish, e^ioread them 
over it, and raise one end, that the liquid may drain from them. When 
they are quite cold, mince, and then mix them with four ounces of fine 
bread-crumbs, an ounce and a half of good butter, and part of that in 
which they were stewed, should the forcemeat appear too moist to 
idmit of the whole, as the yolk of one e^g, at the least, must be added, 
to bind the ingr^ients together; strew m a saltspoonful of salt, a third 



CHAP, vl] forcsmeats. 125 

as much of oiyeniie, and about the same quantity of mace and nutmeg; 
with a teafipoonful of grated lemon-rind. The seasonings must be rathe^ 
sparingly used, that the flavour of the mushrooms may not be aver- 
powered by them. Adix the whole thoroughly with the unbeaten yoUc 
of one egSf or of two, and use the forcemeat poached in small balls Son 
soup, or med and served in the dish with roast fi>wls» or round minced 
veal ; or to fill boiled fowls, partridges, or turkeys. 

Small mushrooms, peeled and trimmed, 4 ozs. ; butter, 1^ oz. ; slight 
sprinkling mace and cayenne : 5 to 7 minutes. Mushrooms minced ; 
bread-crumbs, 4 ozs.; butter, 1^ oz. (with part of that used in the stew- 
ing) ; salt, 1 saltspoonful ; third as much of cavenne, of mace, and of 
nutmeg; grated lemon-rind, 1 teaspoonful; yolk of 1 or 2 eggs. In 
balls, poached, 5 to 6 minutes ; fried, 6 to 8 minutes. 

Obs, — ^This, like most other forcemeats, is improved by being well 
beaten in a large mortar after it is entirely mixed. 

MO. 8. ONION AND SAGE STUFFINO, FOR PORK, OEE8E, OR DUCKS. 

Boil three large onions from ten to fifteen minutes, chop them smalU 
and mix with them an equal quantity of bread-crumbs, a heaped table- 
spoonful of minced sage, an ounce of butter, a half saltspoonful of pej^ 
per, and twice as much of salt, and put them into the body of the goose; 
part of the liver boiled for two or three minutes, and shred fine, is some- 
times added to these, and the whole is bound together with an egg-yolk 
or two ; but they are quite as frequently served without The onions 
can be used raw, when their very strong flavour is not objected to, but 
the odour of the whole dish will then be soidewhat overpowering. 

Large onions, 3 : boiled 20 to 30 minutes. Sage, 2 to 3 dessertspoons- 
ful (or ^ to I oz.) ; butter, 1 oz. ; pepper, ^ teaspoonful ; salt, 1 teap 
spoonful. 

NO. 9. MR. COOKB*S FORCEMEAT FOR D17CK8 OR GEESE. 

Two parts of chopped onion, two parts of bread-crumbs, three of but- 
ter, one of pounded sage, and a seasoning of pepper and salt 
This receipt we have not proved. 

NO. 10. FORCEMEAT BALLS FOR MOCK TURTLE SOUPS. 

The French forcemeat, No. 15 of the present Chapter, is the most 
elegant and appropriate forcemeat to serve in mock turtle, but a more 
solid and highly seasoned one is usually added to it in this country. In 
very commcm cookery the ingredients are merely chopped small and 
mixed together with a moistening of eggs ; but when the trouble of 
pounding and blending them properly is objected to, we would recom- 
mend the common veal forcemeat, No. 1, in preference, as the undressed 
veal and suet, when merely minced, do not produce a good eflect Four 
ounces each of these, with an ounce or so of the lean of a boiled ham, 
and three ounces of bread-crumbs, a large dessertspoonful of minced 
parsley, a small portion of thyme, or marjoram, a saltspoonful of whitu 
pepper, twice as much salt, or more, a little cavenne, half a small nut 
meg, and a couple of eggs, well mixed with a fork first, to separate the 
meat, and after the moistening is added, with the fingers, then rolled 
into balls, an(^ boiled in a little soup for twelve minutes, is the manner 
in which it is prepared ; but the reader will find the following rece/pt 
very superior to it : — Rasp, that is to say, scrape with a knife» clear

ftom the fibre, fbar ounces of veal, which sfaoald be cut into thick slices; 
•nd taken quite free from skin and fat ; chop it fine, and then pound it 
as smoothly as possible in a lar^e mortar, with three ounces of the 
nsped fiit of an unboiled ham, of efood flarour, or of the finest bacon, 
Mia one of butter, two ounces of bread-crumbs^ a taUespoonfiil of the 
lean <»f a boiled ham, should it be at band,, a good seasoning of cayenne, 
nutmeg, and mace, mixed together, a heaped dessertspoomul of minced 
h'erbs^ and the yolks of two eggs; poach a small bit when it is mixed, 
and add an]r fur&er seasoning it may require; and when it is of good 
fiavour, roll it into balls oimodereAe size, and boil &em twelve minutes ; 
then drain and slip them into the soup. No forcemeat should be boiled 
in the soup itself, on account of the fat which would escape from it in 
the process : a little stock should be reserved for the purpose. 

Very common : — Lean of neck of veal, 4 ozs. ; iMsef-kidney suet, 4 
ozs., both finely chopped ; bread-crumbs, 3 ozs. ; minced parsley, large 
dessertspoonful; thyme or marjoram, small teaspoonful; lean oif boiled 
ham, 1 to 2 ozs.; white pepper, 1 saltspoonful; salt, twice as much; 
^ small nutmeg ; eggs, 2 : in balls, 12 minutes. 

Better forcemeat : — ^Lean veal rasped, 4 ozs. ; hi of unboiled ham, or 
finest bacon, 3 ozs. ; butter, 1 oz. ; bread-crumbs, 2 ozs. ; lean of boiled 
ham, minced, 1 large tablespoonfiil ; minced herbs, 1 heaped dessert- 
spoonful ; full seasoning of mace, nutmeg, and cayenne, mixed ; yolks 
of eggs, 2: 12 minutes. 

Na 11. EGO BALLS. 

fioil four or five new-laid eggs for ten or twelve minutes^, and lay 
them into fresh water until they are cold. Take^ out the ydks, and 
pound them smoothly with the beaten yolk of one raw egg^ or more, if 
required ; add a little salt and cayenne, roll the mixture into very snudl 
balls, and boil them for two minutes. Half a teaspoonful of fiour is 
sometimes worked up with the eggs. 

Basd yolks of eggs, 4 ; 1 raw ; little salt, cayenne : 2 minutes. 

NO. 12. BSAIN CAKES. 

Wash and soak the brains well in oold water, and aflerwaids in hot ; 
then remove the skin and large fibres, and boil them in -water, slightly 
salted, from two to three minutes; beat them up with a teaspoonful of 
sage, very finely chopped, or with equal parts of sage and parsley, half 
a teaspoonful or rather more of salt, half as much mace, a little white 
pepper or cayenne, and one egg; drop them in small cakes, and fry them 
a nne light brown : two yolks of eggs will make the cakes more deli- 
cate than the white and yolk of one. A teaspoonful of flour and a litl^ 
lemon-grate are sometimes added. 

HO. 13. ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR BRAIN CAKES. 

Boil the brains In a little eood veal-ffravy very gently for ten minutes, 
drain them on a sieve, and when cold, cut them into thick dice; dip 
them into beaten yolk of eg^, and then into very fine bread-crumbs^ 
mixed with salt, pounded spices, and fine herbs, minced extremely 
Binall ; fiy them of a light brown, drain and dry them well, and slip 
them into the soup or hash after it is dished. When broth or gravy is 
otT at hand, the faiuins may be boiled in water.

NO, 14 AN EXCELLENT FRENCH FCMICEMSAT. 

Take six oonces of veal free from ht and skin, cut it Into dice and 
put it into a saueepan with two ounces erf* batter, a large teaspoonftil of 
parsley finely minced, half aa much thyme, salt, and grated lemon-rind, 
and a sufficient seasoning of nutmeg, cayenne, and mace, to flavour it 
pleasantly. Stew these very gently mm twelve to fifteen minutes, 
then lift out the veal and put into the saucepan two ounces of bread- 
crumbs; let them simmer until they have absorbed the gravv yielded 
by the meat ; keep them stirred until they are as dir as possible ; beat 
the yolk of an egg to them while they are hot, and set them iside to 
cool. Chop and pound the veal, add the bread to it as soon as it is cold, 
beat them well together, with an oqnce and a half of fresh butter, and 
two of the finest bacon, scraped quite clear from rust, skin, and fibre ; 
pot to them the yolks of two small eggs, and mix them well ; then take 
the forcemeat from the mortar, and set it in a yfety cool j^ce until k 
is wanted for use. 

Veal, 6 ozs. ; butter, 2 ozs. ; minced parsley, 1 teaspooufiil ; thyme, 
salt, and lemon-peel, each 1 teaspoonful ; little nutmeg, cayenne, and 
mace : 12 to 15 minutes. Bread-crumbs, 2 ozs. ; butter, 1^ oz. ; rasped 
bacon, 2 ozs. ; yolks of effgs, 2 to 9. 

Obs. 1. — When this forcemeat is intended to fill boned fowls, the 
livers of two or three, boiled for four minutes, or stewed with the veal 
for the same length of time, then minced and pounded with the other 
ingredients, will be found a great improvement; and, if mushrooms can 
be procured, two tablespoonsful of them chopped small, should be stewed 
and beaten with it also. A small portion of the best end of the neck 
will afiS>rd the quantity of lean required for this receipt, and the remains 
of it wiU make ezcel4t gmvy. 

NO. 15. FRENCH FORCEMEAT CALLE0 QUENELLES. 

This is a peculiarly light and delicate kind of forcemeat, which, by 
good French cooks, is compounded with exceeding care. It is served 
abroad in a varietv of forms, and is made of very finely-grained white 
veal, or of the undressed flesh of poultry, or of rablHts, rasped quite free 
from sinew, then chopped and pounded to the finest paste, first by itself 
and afterwards with an equal quantity of boiled calf's udder or of but- 
ter, and of panada, which is but another name for bread soaked in 
cream or gravy and then dried over the fire until it forms a sort of 
paste. As the three ingredients should be equal in volume, not in 
weight, they are each rolled into a separate ball before they are mixed, 
that their size may be determined by the eye. When the fat of the 
fillet of veal (which in England is not often divided for sale, as it is in 
Prance) is not to be procured, a rather less proportion of butter wiH 
serve in its stead. The following will be found a very good, and not a 
troublesome receipt for veal forcemeat of this kind. 

Rasp quite clear from sinew, after the fat and skin have been entirely 
clearea from it, four ounces of the finest veal ; chop, and pound it well : 
if it be carefully prepared there will be no necessi^ for passing it 
through a sieve, but this should otherwise be done. Soak in a small 
saucepan two ounces of the crumb of a stale loaf in a little rich but 



128 MODESN OOOKERT. £cHAP. Yl. 

pal« yeal gravy, or white sauce ; then press and drain as much as pos- 
sibk of the moisture from it, and stir it over a gentle fire until it is as 
dry as it will become without burning : it will adhere in a ball to the 
tponn, and leave the saucepan quite dry when it is sufficiently done. 
Mix with it, while it is still hot, the yolk of one egg, and when it is 
quite cold, add it to the veal with three ounces of very fresh butter, a 
quarter-teaspoonful of mace, half as much cayenne, a little nutmeg, and 
a saltspoonful of salt When these are perfectly beaten, and well 
blended together, add another whole egg -after having merely taken out 
the germs ; the mixture will then be ready for use, and may be moulded 
into balls, or small thick oval shapes, a little flattened, and poached in 
soup or gravy from ten to fifteen minutes. These queneUet may be 
served by themselves in a rich sauce, as a comer dish, or in conjunction 
with other things. They may likewise be first poached for three or 
toiir minutes, and left on a drainer to become cold ; then dipped into 
egg and the finest bread-crumbs, and fried, and served as croquettes.

The very finest sausage-meat, highly seasoned, and made with an 
equal proportion of fat and lean, is an exceedingly good forcemeat for 
yeal, chicken, rabbit, and some few other pies ; savoury herbs minced 
small, may be added to heighten its flavour, if it be intended for imme- 
diate eating ; but it will not then remain good quite so long, unless they 
should have been previously dried. To prevent its being too dry, two 
or three spoonsful of cold water should be mixed with it before it is put 
into the pie. One pound of lean veal to one and a quarter of the pork- 
£it is sometimes used, and smoothly pounded with a high seasoning of 
spices, herbs, and eschalots, or garlic, but we cannot recommend the 
introduction of these last into pies unless they are especially ordered : 
mushrooms may be mixed with any kind of forcemeat with far better 
effect Equal parts of veal and fat bacon will also make a good force- 
meat for pies, if chopped finely and well spiced.

PANADA. 

This is the name given to the soaked bread which is mixed with the 
French forcemeats, and which renders them so peculiarly delicate. 
Pour on the crumb of two or three rolls, or on that of any oUier very 
light bread, as much good boiling broth, milk, or cream as will covet 
and moisten it well ; put a plate over to keep in the steam, and let it 
remain for half an hour, or more ; then drain off the superfluous liquid, 
and squeeze the panada dry by wringing it round in a thin cloth into a 
ball ; put it into a small stewpan, or well tinned saucepan, and pour to 
it as much only of rich white sauce, or of gravy, as it can easily absorb, 
and stir it constantly with a wooden spoon, over a clear and gentle fire, 
until it forms^ a very dry paste, and adheres in a fhass to the spoon'; 
when it is in this state, mix with it, thoroughly, the unbeaten yolk of 
two firesh eggs, which will give it firmness, and set it aside to become

qaite cold befere It is put into the mortar. The beet French cooks give 
the highest degree of savour that they can to this panada, and add no 
other seasoning to the forcemeats of which it forms a part : it is used 
in an equal proportion with the meat, and calf's udder or buttei of 
which they are composed, as we have shown in the preceding receipt 
for quenelles. They stew slowly, for the purpose, a small bit of lean 
ham, two or three minced eschalots, a bayleaf, a few mushrooms, s 
little parsley, a clove or two, and a small blade of mace, in a little good 
butter, and when they are sufficiently browned, pour to them as much 
broth or gravy as will be needed for the panada ; and when this, bacf 
simmered from twenty to thirty minutes, so as to have acquired the 
poper flavour, without being much reduced, they strain it over, and 
boil it into the bread. The common course of cookery in an English 
kitchen does n6t often require the practice of the greater niceties and 
refinements of the art: and trouble (of which the French appear to be 
perfectly regardless when the excellence of their preparations is con« 
cemed) is there in general so much thought of, and exclaimed against, 
that a more summary process would probably meet with a better chance 
<^ success. 

A quicker and rougher mode of making the panada, and indeed the 
forcemeat altogether, is to pour strong veal broth or gravy upon it, and 
after it has soaked, to boil it dry, without any addition except that of a 
little fine spice, lemon-grate, or any other favourite seasoning. Minced 
herbs, salt, cayenne, and mace may be beaten with the meat, to which 
a Bmall portion of well-pounded ham may likewise be added at pleasure. 



CHAPTER VIL 
BOILING, ROASTING, &c. 

TO BOIL MBAT. 



Large joints of meat should be neatly trimmed, wa^Ked extremely 
clean, and skewered or bound firmly into good shape, wnen they are of 
a nature to require it; then well covered with cold water, brought to 
boil over a moderate fire, and simmered until they are done, the scum 
being carefully and entirely cleaned from the surface of the water, as it 
gathers there, which will be principally from within a few minutes of 
Its beginning to boil, and during a few minutes afterwards. If not tho- 
roughly skimmed oif at the proper time, it will sink, and adhere to the 
joint, giving it a very uninviting appearance. 

We cannot too strongly again impress upon the cook the advantages 
of gentle simmering over the usual fast-boiling of meat, by which, as 
has been already l&cibly shown (see article BoniUon, Chapter I.), the 
outside is hardened and deprived of its juices before the inside is half 
done, while the starting of the fiesh from the bones which it occasions^ 
9Dd the altogether ragged aspect which it gives, are most unsightly. 



190 MODXIIN COOKERY. [CHAP. VII. 

Pickled or salted meat requires longer boiling than fresh; and that 
which is smoked and dried longer still. This last should always be 
slowly heated, and if, from any circumstances, time cannot have been 
allowed for soaking it properly, and there is a probability of its being 
too salt when served, it should be brought very sofUv to boil in a large 
quantity of water, which should in part be changed bb soon as it m- 
comes quite briny, for as much more that is ready boiling. 

It is customary to lay large joints upon a fish-plate, or to throw some 
wooden skewers under them, to prevent their sticking to the vessel in 
which they are cooked ; and it is as well to take the precaution, though, 
unless they be placed over a very fierce fire, they cannot be in danger 
of this. The time allowed for them is about the same as for roasting, 
from fifteen to twenty minutes to the pound. For cooking rounds of 
bee( and other ponderous joints, a pan of this form is very convenient 

Bv means of two almost equally expensive preparations, called a 
podee, and a blanc^ the insipidity which results from boiling meat or 
vegetables in water only, mav be removed, and the whiteness of either 
wul be better preserved. Turkeys, fowls, sweetbreads, calf *b brains, 
cauliflowers, and artichoke bottoms, are the articles for which the poUee 
and the hUmc are more especially used for refined foreign cookerjr : the 
reader will judge by the rollowing receipts how far they are admissible 
into that of the economist 

POEXiEE. 

Cut into large dice two pounds of lean veal, and two pounds of fat 
t)acou, cured without saltpetre, two large carrots, and two onions ; to 
tliese add half a pound of n'esh butter; put the whole into a stewpan, and 
stir it with a wooden spoon over a gentle fire, until the veal is very 
white, and the bacon is partially melted ; then pour to them three pint4 
of clear boiling broth or water, throw in four cloves, a small bunch oi 
two of thyme and parslev, a bay-leaf, and a few corns of white pepper *, 
boil these gentlv for an hour and a half, then strain the poilee through 
a fine sieve, and set it by in a cool place. Use it instead of water for 
boiling the various articles we have already named : it will answer for 
several in succession, and will remain good for many days. Some cooks 
order a pound of butter in addition to the bacon, and others substitute 
bee^uet in part for this last 

A RLANC. 

Put into a stewpan one pound of fiit bacon rasped, one pound of beef 
suet cut small, and one pound of butter, the strained juice of two lemons, 
a couple of bay-leaves, three cloves, three carrots, and three onions 
divided into dice, and less than half a pint of water. Simmer these 
gently, keeping them often stirred, until the fat is well melted, and the 
water has evaporated ; then pour in rather more than will be required 
for the dish which is to be cooked in the blanc; boil it softly until all 
the ingredients have given out their full flavour, skim it well, and salt 
if needed, and strain it off* for use. A calfs head is often boiled in thid.

Rcnsting, which is quite the favourite 
DMde of dreBsing meat in the United States, 
aod one, of consequence, most bmiliar 
to ua, requires unremitting attentitHi oa 
the pertoi the cook, rather than any great 
exertion of ekUl. I^arge kilchena are 
UBually fitted with tt nnoke-jack, by meana 
of which several spits, if neediul, can be 
kept turning at the same time; but in 
small establishments, a roeater which al- 
lows of some economy in point of fuel ia 
more commonly used. That ahown in tha 
print is of very advontagpeous construction 
in this respect, as a joint may be cooked 
in it with a comparatively souill fire, the 
heat being strongly reflected &om the 
screen upon the meal; in consequence of 
this, it should never be placed very close 
to the grate, aa the surft.ce of the joint 
would then become dry and hard. 

A more convenient form of roaster, with 
a spit placed horizontally, and turned by 
means of a wheel and chain, of which the 
movement is regulated by a spring con- 
tained in- a box at the top, is of the same 
economical order as the one above. 

For roasting without either of these, I 
make up a. fire proportioned in width and 
height lo the joint which is to be roasted, 
and which it ^uuld surpass in dimensions 
every way, by two or three inches. Place 
Bome moderate-sized lumps of coal on the 
top; let it be ftee from smoke and ashes 
in front; and so compactly arranged that 
it will neither require to be disturbed, nor 
supplied with fresh liiel, Ibr some cod- • 
siderable time after the me^t ia laid down. 
Spit the joint and place it very far from 
the fire at first; keep it constantly basted, 
and when it is two perls done, move it nearE 

properly browned; hut guard carefully against it being burned. A 
tew minutes before it is taken from the spit, sprinkle a little fine salt 
over it, haste it thoroughly with its own dripping, or with butter, and 
dredge it with flour: aa aoon as the troth is well risen, dish, and serve 
the meat Or, to avoid the necessity of the frothing, which ia often

will then form a savoury incrufliltatipn upon it, and assist to prevent the 
escape of its juices. When meat or poultry is wrapped m buttered 
paper it must not be floured until this is removed, which should be M- 
teen or twenty minutes befi^re either is served. 

Remember always to draw back the dripping-pan when the <flre has 
to be stirred, or when fresh coals are thrown on, that the cinders and 
ashes may not &11 into it 

When meat is very lean, a dice of butter, or a small quantity of cla« ' 
rified dripping should be melted in the pan to baste it with at first; 
though the use of the latter should be scrupulously avoided for poultry, 
or any delicate meats, as the flavour it imparts is to many persons pe- 
culiarly objectionable. Let the spit be kept bright and clean, and wipe 
it before the meat is put on ; baUnce the joint well upon it, that it may 
turn steadily and if needful secure it with screw-skewers. A cradle 
spit, which IS so constructed that it contains the meat in a sort of frame- 
work, instead of passing through it, may be often very advantageously 
used instead of an ordinary one, as the perforation of the meat by this 
last must always occasion some escape of the juices; and it is, more- 
over, particularlv to be objected to in roasting joints or poultry which 
have been boned and filled with forcemeat The cradle spit (for which 
see " Turkey Booed and Forced," Chapter XII.) is much better suited 
to, these, as well as to a sucking pig, sturgeon, salmon, and other large 
fish ; but it is not very commonly to be found in our kitchens, many of 
which exhibit a singular scantiness of the conveniences which fiicilitate 
the labours of the cook. 

For heavy and substantial joints, a quarter of an hour is generally 
allowed for every pound of meat ; and, with a sound fire and frequent 
basting, will be found sufficient when the process is conducted in the 
usual manner ; but bv the slow method, as we shall designate it, almost 
double the time will be required. Pork, veal, and lamb, should always 
be well roasted ; but many eaters prefer mutton and beef rather under- 
dressed, though some persons have a strong objecticm to the sight even 
of any meat that is not thoroughly cooked. 

Joints which are thin in proportion to their weight, requure less of 
the fire than thick and solid ones. Ribs of beef, for example, will be 
sooner ready to serve than an equal weight of the rump, round or sir- 
loin; and the neck or shoulder of mutton, or spare rib of pork, than 
the leg. 

When to preserve the succulence of the meat is more an object than 
to eeonomize fuel, beef and mutton should be laid at twice the usual dis- 
tance from the fire, and allowed to remain so until they are perfectly 
heated through ; the roasting, so managed, will of course be dow ; and 
firom three hours and a half to four- hours will be necessary to cook by 
this method a leg of mutton of ordinary size, for which two hours would 
amply suffice in a common way ; but the flesh will be remarkably ten- 
der, and the flow of gravy from it most abundant It should not be 
drawn near the fire until within the last hour, and should then be 
placed only so close as to brown it properly. No kind of roast indeed 
should at any time be allowed to take colour too quickly ; it should be 
heated ^dually, and kept at least at a moderate distance from the fire 
until it IS nearly done, or the outside will be dry and hard, if not burned, 
while the inside will be only half-cooked.

The application of steam to culinary par- 
poses is becoming very general in our kitchens 
at the present day, especially in those of large 
establishments, many of which are furnished 
with apparatus for its use, so admirably con- 
structed, and so complete, that the process may 
be conducted on an extensive scale, with very 
slight trouble to the cook ; and with the fiir- 
tber advantage of being at a distance from the 
Jire, the steam being conveyed by pipes to the Saueepan, with Stamner. 
vessels intended to receive it. Fish, butcher's meat, poultry, vegetiir 
bles, puddings, maccaroni, and rice, are all subjected to its action, in- 
stead of being immersed in water, as in simple boiling ; and the result 
is to many persons perfectly- satisfactory ; though, as there is a difier- 
ence of opinion amongst firstprate cooks, with regard to the comparative 
merits of the two modes of dressing meat and Jlsh^ a trial should be 
^ven to the steaming, on a small scale, before any great expenses are 
incurred fbr it, which may be done easily with a common saucepan or 
boiler, fitted like the one shown above, with a simple tin steamer. Sei^ 
vants not accustomed to the use of these, should be warned against boil- 
ing in the vessel itself any thing of coarse or strong flavour, when the 
article steamed is of a delicate nature. The vapour from soup contain- 
ing onions, fbr example, would have a very bad effect on a sweet pud- 
ding especially, and on many other dishes. Care and discretion, there- 
ibre, must be exercised on this point. By means of a kettle fixed over 
it, the steam of the boiler in the kitchen range, may be made available 
fbr cooking, in the way shown by the engraving, which exhibits fish, 
potatoes, and their sauces, all in procuress 
of steaming at the same time. The limits 
of our work do not permit us to enter at ^^^ 
much length upon this subject, but the ^^ 
reader who may wish to understand the na- ^ 
ture of steam, and the various modes in 
which its agency may be applied to domes- 
tic purposes, will do well to consult Mr. 
Webster's excellent work, (EncyclopcBdia 
of Domestic Economy,) of which we have 
more particularly spoken in another chap- 
ter. The quite inexperienced cook may require to be told, that any 
article of food which is to be cooked by steam in a saucepan of the form 
exhibited in the first of the engravings of this section, must be prepared 
exactly as for boiling, and laid mto tihe sort of strainer affixed to the top 
of the saucepan ; and that water, or some other kind of liquid, must be 
put into the saucepan itself, and kept boiling in it, the lid being first 
closely fixed into the steamer.

This very wholesome, convenient, and economical mode of cookery is 

by no means so well understood nor profited by in England or Amenca 

as on the continent, where its advantages are fully appreciated. So

smoke and blaze of a large coal fire are very unfavourable to many 
other modes of cookery as well. The American as well as the French 
have generally the advantage of the embers and ashes of the wood 
^hich is their ordinary fuel ; and they have always, in addition, a stove 
of this construction in which charcoal or braise (for explanation of this 
word, see remarks on preserving, Chapter XXI.) only is burned ; and 

upon which their stewpans can, when there 
is occasion, be left uncovered, without the 
danger of their contents being spoiled, 
which there generally is with us. It is

been made in our own stoves ;* and the hot

Bteiii'pans must be placed on trevets high above the fire, and be con- 
stantly watched, and moved, as occasion may require, nearer to, or fur7

No copper'vessels from which the inner tinning is in the slightest 
degree worn away should ever be used for this or for any other kmd of 
cookery; for not health only, but life itself; may be endangered by 
them.f We have ourselves seen a dish of acid fruit which had been 
boiled without sugar, in a copper pan from which the tin lining was 
half worn away, coated with verdigris after it had become cold; and 
firom the careless habits of the person who had prepared it, the chances 
were greatly in fiivour of its b^ing served to a family afterwards, if it 
had not been accidentally discovered. Salt acts upon the copper in the 
same manner as acids : vegetables, too, from the portion of the latter 
which they contain, have the same injurious effect; and the greatest 
danger results from allowing preparations containing any of Uiese to 
become cold (or cool) in the stewpan, in contact with the exposed part 
of the copper in the inside. Thick, well-tinned iron saucepans will

taken, dissolved in water, so as to form quite a syrup, by persons who may unfortu

as to be unpleasant eating. A brisk fire perfteily free from tmoke, a 
very clean gridiron, tender meat, a dish and plates as hot as they can 
be, and great despatch in sending it to table when done, are all essen- 
tial to the serving of a good broil. The gridiron should be well heated, 
and TuUied with mutton suet befi>re the meat is laid on, and it shculd 
be placed dopingly over the fire, that the &t may run off to the lack

done with kidneys aka Fish is &ess dry, and of better flavour, as well 
as less liable to be smoked, if it be wrapped in a thickly buttered sheet 
of writing paper before it is placed on the gridiron. For the more deli- 
catenshinned kinds, the bars should be rubbed with chalk instead of 
enet, when the paper is omitted. Cutlets, or meat in any other form, 
when egged and crumbed for broiling, should afterwards be dipped into 
clarified butter, or sprinkled with it plentifully, as the egg-yolk and 
bread will otherwise form too dry a crust upon it French cooks season 
(heir cntlets both with salt and pepper, and brush a little oil or butter 
oyer them to keep them moist; but unless this be done, no seasoning 
of salt should be given them until they are just ready to be dished : the 
French method is a very good one. 

Steaks or cntlets may be quickly cooked with a 
sheet or two of lighted paper only, m the apparatus 
shown in the preceding page, and called a conjurer. 
Lift off the cover and lay in the meat properly sea- 
soned, with a small slice of butter under it, and in- 
sert the lighted paper in the aperture shown in the 
plate ; in from eight to ten mmutes the meat will 
be done, and found to be remarkably tender, and 
very palatable : it must be turned and moved occa- 
sionally during the procesa This is an especially 
convenient nK>de of cooking for persons whose 
hours of dining are renderecT uncertain by the na- 
ture of their avocations. For medical men en- 
gaged in extensive country practice it has been 
often proved so. The conjurer costs but a few 
shillings. Another form of this economical appa- 
ratus, with which a pint of water may be made to 
boil by means of only a G^eet of paper wrapped round a cone, in the 
inside, is shown in the second plate. 

This is an operation, which, though apparently 
^very simple, requires to be more carefully and 
skilfully conducted than it commonly is. Its suc- 
cess depends principally on allowing the &t to 
attain the exact degree of heat which shall ^ive 
firmness, without too quick browning or scorcbmg, 
before anything is laid into the pan ; for if this be neglected the article 
fried will be saturated with the &t, and remain pale and flaccid. When 
the requisite degree of colour is acquired before the cooking is complete, 
the pan should he placed high above the fire, that it may be continued 
slowly to the proper point Steaks and cutlets should be seasoned with 
salt and pepper, and dredged on both sides lightly with flour before they 
are laid into the pan, in which they should 1^ often moved and turned,

moiftened with clarified Imtter, pg directed in Chapter IL, lor baked 
iolee, and placed in the oven for about half an hour, will be found very 
rich and highly flavoured. Part of the middle of the salmon led entire, 
well cleaned, and thproughlv dried, then seasoned, and securely wrapped 
in two or three folds of thickly buttered paper, will also prove excellent 
eating, if gently baked. (This may likewise be roasted in a Dutch 
Dven, either folded in the paper, or left without it, and basted with 
butter.) 

Hams, when freshly cured, and not over salted, if neatly trimmed, 
and closely wrapped in a coarse paste, are both more juicy, and of finer 
fiavour baked than boiled. Savoury or pickled beef, too, put into a deep 
pan, with a little gravy, and plenty of^ butter, or clipped suet on the 
top, to prevent the outside from becoming dry ; then covered with paste, 
or with several folds of thick paper, and set into a moderate oven for 
four or five hours, or even longer, if it be of large weight, is an excel- 
lent dish. A goose, a leg of pork, and a sucking pig, if properly attended 
to while in the oven, are said to be nearly, or quite as good as if roasted ; 
but baking is both an unpalatable and an unprofitable mode of cooking 
joints of meat in general, though its great convenience to many persons 
renders it a very common one. 

It is usual to raise meat from the dish in which it is sent to the oven 
by placing it, properly skewered, on a stand, so as to allow potatoes or 
a batter pudding to be baked under it. A fow button onions, freed from 
the outer skin, or three or four large ones, cut in halves, are sometimes 
put beneath a shoulder of mutton. Two sheets of paper spread sepa* 
rately with a thick layer of butter, clarified marrow, or any other fiit, 
and fastened securely over the outside of a joint, will prevent its being 
too much dried by the fierce heat of the oven. A fow spoonsful of water 
or (;ravy should be poured into the dish with potatoes, and a little salt 
fprmkled over them. 

A celebrated French cook recommends braUing in the oven: that is 
to say, after the meat has been arranged in the usual manner, and just 
hrouffbt to boil over the fire, that Sie braising pan, closely stopped, 
should be put into a moderate oven, for the same length of time as 
would b^ required to stew the meat perfectly tender. 

BBAISING. 

Braising is but a more expensive mode 
of stewing meat The following French 
recipe will explain Uie process. We 
would observe, however, that the layers 
of beef or veal, in which the joint to be 
braised is imbedded, can afterwards be con^ 
verted into excellent soup, gravy, or glate; 
and that there need, in consequence, be nv 
English Braising-pan. waste, nor any unreasonable degree of ex- 
pense attending it ; but it is a troublesome process, and quite as good a 
result may be obtained by simmering the meat in very strong gravy. 
Should the flavour of the bacon be considered an advantage, luices of it 
can bo laid over the article braised, and secured to it with a fillet of 
tape.

possible ; have ready some strips of unsmoked bacon^ half as thick as

and a bunch of sweet herbs, and place the fillet on them. Cover it 
with slices of bacon, put some trimmings of meat all round it, and pour 
on to it half a pint of good bouillon or gravy. Let it stew as gentlr at 
possible for two hours and a half; take it up, and keep it very hot; 
strain, and reduce the gravy by quick boiling until it is thick enoogh to 

Slaze with ; brush the meat over with it ; put the rest in the dish with 
le fillet, after the tape has been removed fiom it, and send it duectly 
to table." 

Equal parts of Madeira and gravy are sometimes used to moisten th« 
meat 

No attempt should be made to braise a joint in any vessel that is not 
verv nearly of its own size. 

A round of buttered paper is generally pot over the more delicate 
kinds of braised meat, to prevent £eir being browned by the fire, whidi 
in France is put round the lid of the braising-pan, in a groove made on 
purpose to contain it The embers of a wora fire mix^ with the hot 
ashes are best adapted to sustain the regular, but gentle degre^Mf heat 
required for this mode of cooking. 

The pan shown at the head of this section, with a closely fitting eof^ 
per tray, serving for the cover, is used 
commonly in England for braising; but a 
stewpan of modem form, or any other 
vessel which will admit of embers being 
placed upon the lid, will answer for the 
puroose as well. 

Common cooks sometimes stew meat in 
a mhitore of butter and water, and caU it

Larding Pins. 

Cut into slices, of the same length and thickness, some bacon of the 
finest qmlity ; trim away the outsides, place the slices evenly upon 
each other, and with a sharp knifb diviae them obliquely into small 
strips of equal size. For pheasants, partridges, hares, fowls, and fri- 
candeaux, the bacon should be about the eighth of ar inch square, and 
two inches in length ; but for meat which is to be larded quite through, 
instead of on the outside merely, the bits of bacon (properly called lar« 
dooas) must be at least the third of an inch square. 

In general, the breasts only of birds are kuded, the backs and thighs

ef mbbitB, and the whole of the upper surface of a fricandeau : these 
should be thickly covered with small lardoons, i^aced at regular inter- 
vals, and in lines which intersect each other, so as to Ibrm rather mi' 
nute diamonds. 

The following directions for larding a partridge will serve equally 
for poultry, or for other kinds of game : — 

Becure one end of the bacon in a slight larding-pin, and on the point 
of this take up sufficient of the flesh of the bird to hold the lanlooa 
firmly ; draw the pin through it, and part of the bacon, of which the 
two ends should be left of equal length. Proceed thus, until the breast 
of the pheasant is entirely varnished with lardoons, when it ought to 
resemble in appearance a cake thickly stuck with slips of almonds. 

The larger strips of bacon, after being rolled in a high seasoning of 
minced herbs and spices, are used to lard the inHde of meat, and they 
should be proportioned to its thickness, as they must be poissed quite 
through it For example : a four inch slice from a rump of beef will 
lequire lardoons of very nearly that length, which must be drawn 
through with a lar^e larding-pin, and left in it, with the ends just out 
of sight on either side. 

In France, truffles, anchovies, slices of toUgue, and of fat, all trimmed 
into proper shape, are occasionally used for larding. The ^con em- 
ployed there for the purpose is cured without any saltpetre (as this 
would redden the white meats), and it is never smoked : the receipt for 
it will be found in Chapter XL 

A tudjpy is sometimes larded with alternate lardoonsof&t bacon and 
of bullSk's tongue, which has been pickled but not dried : we appre- 
hend that the lean of a half-boiled ham, of good colour, could answer 
the purpose quite as well, or better. 

liirding the surface of meat, poultry, or game, gives it a good appear- 
ance, but it is a more positive improvement to meat of a dry nature to 
interlard the inside with large lardoons of well-seasoned, delicate, 
striped bacon. 

BONING. 

Very minute directions being given in other parts of our volume for 
this, we confine ourselves here to the following rules : — ^in disengaging 
the flesh from it, work the knife always close to the bone, and take 
every care not to pierce the outer skin. 

TO BLANCH HEAT OR YEGETTABLES. 

This is merely to throw either into a pan of boiling water for a few 
minutes, which gives firmness to the first, and is necessary for some 
modes of preparing vegetables. 

The breast only of a bird is sometimes held in the water while it 
boils, to render it firm for larding. To preserve the whiteness of meat, 
and the bright green of vegetables, they are lifted from the water aAer 
they have boiled a few minutes, and are thrown immediately into spring 
water, and left till cold. 

5 to 10 minutes. 

OLAZINO. 

This process we have explained at the article Olaze, Chapter ID. 
The sufface of the meat should be covered evenly, with two or three

separate layers of the glaze, which, if 
properly made, soon becomes firm. A 
ham should be well dried in the oven be- 
fore it is laid on. Cutlets of all kinds may 
be glazed before they are sent to table, 
with very good effect The figure above 
represents a g^laze-pot and brush, used 
for heating and applying the prreparation : 
a jar placed in a pan of boiling water 
may be substituted for the first, when it is 
not at hand. 






A very cheap apparatus, by which chops can be dressed before r 
clear fire, is shown by the first of these figures ; and the second is pecu 
liarJy convenient when bread or mnffins are required to be toasted ex- 
peditiously and in lar^e quantities, without much time and attention 
being bestowed upon tSem. 

To broum the surface of a duh without baking or fUfxcmg it at 

the fire. 

This is done with a salamander, as it is called, formed like the en- 
graving below ; it is heated in the fire, and held over the dish suffi- 
ciently near to give it colour. It is very much used in a superior order 
of cookery. A kitchen shovel is sometimes substituted for it on au 
emergency.

TO CHOOSE BEEF. 



If young and freshly killed, the lean of ox-heef will be smoothly 
grained, and of a fine, healthy, carnation-red, the fat rather white than 
yellow, and the suet white and firm. Heifer-beef is more closely 
grained, and rather less bright of colour, the bones are considerably 
smaller, and the fat of a purer white. 

' Of bull-beef we only speak to warn our readers, that it is of all meat 
the coarsest and the most rank in flavour. It may be known by its 
dark hue, its close tough fibre, and the scanty proportion, bad appear- 
ance, and strong odour of its fiit 

In choice and well-fed beef, the lean will be found intergrained with 
&t : very lean meat is always of an inferior quality. 

The ribs, the sirloin, and the rump, are the proper joints for roasting. 
The round, or buttock, the edge-bone, the second round, or mouse-but- 
tock, the shin, the brisket, the shoulder, or leg of mutton piece, and the 
clod may be boiled or stewed. The neck is generally used for soup or 
gravy ; and the thin flank for collaring. The best steaks are cut from 
the middle of the rump; the next best from the veiny piece, or from 
the chuck-rib. The inside of the sirloin, commonly used for the pur- 
pose in France, makes by &r the most delicate steaks; but though ex- 
eeedingly tender, they are considered by English epicures to be want- 
'me in flavour. 

The finest part of the sirloin is the chump-end, which contains the 
larger portion of the fillet: of the ribs, the middle ones are those gene- 
rally preferred by experienced housekeepers. 



CBAF nSL] BKKF. 143 

TO soAffr ORLonr, ob ribs cw beef. 

Let the joint hang as long* as it can possibly be kept perfectly sweet 
When it is first brought m, remove the pipe of marrow which runs 
along the backbone, and cut out the kernels from the fat Be very 
careful in summer to ffuard it firom flies ; examine it frequently in warm 
or damp weather ; and scrape off with a knife, or wipe away with a 
^ry cloth, any moisture which may appear on the surface : when this 
ha3 been done, dust some powdered ginger or pepper over it Unless 
the joint should be very large, its appearance will be improved by 
taking off the ends of the bones, which may then be laid in salt for a 
iew days, and afterwards boiled. Spit the beef firmly ; keep it &r 
back from the fire until it is well heated through ; baste it constantly ; 
and proceed as directed in the general rules for roasting (see page 131). 
Persons who object to meat being frothed for table, have it dredged 
with flour when it is first placed at the fire, and sprinkled with fine salt 
when it is nearly done. It is not necessarjr to paper the &t of beef, aa 
many cooks direct, if proper attention be given to it while roasting. 

As a general rule, it may be observed, Siat when the steam from the 
meat draws strongly towards the fire, it is nearly or quite ready to serve. 
The time required to roast it will depend on the state of the weather,* 
the size and strength of the fire, the thickc^ess of the joint, the use or 
non-use of a meat-screen or reflector, the general temperature of the 
kitchen and other contingencies. A quarter of an hour for each pound 
of meat is commonly allowed for solid, heavy joints, and, if the direc- 
tions we have given be attended to, this will not be found too much even 
for persons who prefer beef somewhat rare : it must be left longer at the 
fire if wished very thoroughly roasted, and quite double the usual time 
when the plan we have noticed at page 132, is adopted. When likely 
to be sent to tabid hashed, minced, or dressed a second time in any way, 
the juices of the meat should be dried up as little as possible when it is 
first cooked. 

ROAST RUMP OF BEEF. 

As this joint is generally too large to serve whole, as much of it as 
will form a handsome dish should ^ cut from the chump end to roast 
It must be managed as the sirloin, to which it is commonly preferred by 
connoisseurs. When boned and rolled into the form of a fillet of veal, 
88 it sometimes is, nearly or quite an additional hour should be allowed 
to dress it 

TO ROAST PART OF A ROUND OF BEEF. 

'The natural division of the meat will show where the silver side of 
the round is to be separated from the upper or tongue side, which is the 
proper part for roasting, and which will be found equally ffood and pro- 
fitable for the purpose, if allowed to hang as long as it can oe kept swee.^ 
before it is pressed. Care should be taken in dividing the meat, not to 
pierce the inner skin. The silver side, with the udder, if there diould 
be one to the joint, may be pickled, spiced, or simply salted, and will be 
excellent either way. The outside fiit should be drawn tightly round 

* The meat will be much sooner done in hot weather than in cold. If flrozen, it muat 
be thawed very gradually before it is pat to the fire, or no length of time will roast it ; 
tbia will be effected better by laying it into eold water for some hours before it is 
wanted, than by any other means.

the remainder of the bsei; wUeb nmet b» ftnlf dnwered, or bound 
with tape, to keep it in form. It will require long roasting at a sprang, 
ateady fire, and should be kept conatantly basted. 

Beer; 14 lbs.: 4i to 5 hours. 

06«.— We think that lardiJig the beef quite throi^h with large lar- 
doonsof firm &t,of udder, or of bacon, would be an improvement ; and 
we ought also to observe, that ualesa it be yeuog and ol fine quality, it 
will not answer well for roasting. 

TO BOAST A FILUST 0» BKBF. 

Raise the fillet from the inside of the sirloin, or ham p»t of it, widi 
a sharp knife; leave the ikt on, trim off the skin, lard it through, or all 
over, or roast it, quite plain ; baste it with butter, and send it very hot 
to table, with tomata sauce, or sauce piquante, or eschalot saace, in a 
tureen. It is sometimes served with brown gravy or corruit jellv: k 
should then be garnished witb forcemeat^balla, made as for hare. If net 
very large, an hour and a ouarter will loast it well with a brisk fire. 

ObB, — ^The remainder of the joint may be boned*, rolled, and Boasted, 
or braised ; or made into meat cakes; or served as a miniature round of 
bee£ 

1 hour, 15 nunutes. 

BOA0T BEXr STKAK. 

If extremelv tender, a large slice from the middle of the rump will 
make an excellent small dish of roast meat, when a joint is not easily 
to be procured. Let it be smoothly cut, from an inch to an inch and a 
half thick, flattened on a table, and the inside sprinkled with a little 
fine salt and cayenne, or common pepper. Make a roll of forcemeat, as 
No. 1 (page 122), adding, at pleasure, a flavouring of minced onion or 
eschalot, and increasing the quantity of spices; place this on one end 
of the steak, and roll it up tightly in it; skewer and bind the meat so 
that the forcemeat cannot escape, fasten a buttered paper over it, and 
roast it an hour and a half, or more, according to its size. Twenty 
minutes before it is served, take off the paper, and flour the meat, which 
should be kept well basted with butter all the time it is roasting. Send 
brown gravy to table with it, and pour a little over the beef. 

H hour, or more. 

TO BROIL BEEF STEAKS. 

The steaks should be from half to three-quarters of an inch thick, 
equally sliced, and freshly cut from the middle of a well-kept, finely 
grained, and tender romp of beef. Thev should be neatly trimmed, and 
once or twice divided, if very lar^e. The fire, as we have already said 
in the general directions for broilin? (page 135), must be strong and 
dear. The bars of the gridiron should be thin, and not very close toge- 
ther. When they are thoroughly heated, without being'sufficiently 
burning to scorch the meat, wipe and rub them with fresh mutton suet; 
next pepper the steaks slightly, but never season them with salt before 
they are dressed ; lay them on the gridiron, and when done on one side, 
turn them on the other, being careful to catch, in the dish in which they 
are tn be sent to table, any gravy which may threaten to drain from 
hem when they are moved. Let them be served the insUmi they are 
jaken from the fire ; and have ready at the moment, dish, cover, and

CSAP. Ym.] BBBF. 1*16 

plates, as hot as they can be. From eight to ten minutes will be snffi- 
cient to broil steaks for the generality of waters, and more than enough 
for Uiose who like them but partially done. 

Genuine amateurs seldoiji take prepared sauce or gravy with their 
steaks, as they consider the natural juices of the meat sufficient When 
any accompaniment to them is desired, a small quantity of choice mush- 
room catsup may be warmed in the dish that is lieated to receive them; 
and which, when the not very refined flavour of a raw eschalot is liked, 
as it is by some eaters, may previously be rubbed with one, of which 
the large end has been cut o£ A thin slice or two of fi'esh butter is 
sometimes laid under the steaks, where it soon melts and mingles with 
the gravy which flows from them. The appropriate tureen sauces for 
broiled beef steals are onion, tomata, oyster, eschalot, hot horseradish, 
and brown cucumber, or mushroom sauce. 

Obs, 1. — ^We have departed a little in this receipt from our previous 
instructions £)r broiling, by recommending that the steaks should be 
turned but once, instead of ** ofl;en," as all grlsat authorities on the sub" 
ject direct By trying each metliod, our readers will be able to decide 
for themselves upon the preferable one : we can only say, that we have 
never eaten steaks so excellent as those which have been dressed exactly 
in accordance with the receipt we have just given, and we have taken 
infinite pains to ascertain the really best mc^e of preparing this very 
favourite English dish, which so constantly makes its appearance bota 
carelessly cooked and ill served, especially at private tables. 

Obs, 2. — It is a good plan to throw a few bits of charcoal on the fire 
some minutes before the steaks are laid down, as they give forth a 
strong heat without any smoke. 

The upright gridirons, by which meat is rather toasted than broiled, 
though used in many kitchens and generally pronounced exceedingly 
convenient, where they have been tried, do not appear to us so well 
adapted for dressing steaks as those of less modern fashion, which are 
placed over, instead of before the fire. 

BEEF STEAKS A LA FRAN9AISE. 

The inside of the sirloin freed from skin, and cut evenly into round 
quarter-inch slices, should properly be used for these ; but when it can- 
not be obtained, part of the rump must be substituted for it Season 
the steaks with nrie salt and pepper, brush them with a little clarified 
batter, and boil them over a clear, brisk fire. Mix a teaspoonful of 
parsley, minced extremely fine, with a large slice of fresh butter, a 
little cayenne, and a small quantity of salt When the steaks are done, 
put the mixture into the dish intended for them, and lay them upon it ; 
garnish them plentifully with fried potatoes. It is an improvement to 
squeeze the juice of half a lemon on tlie butter, before the meat is 
heaped over it The potatoes should be sliced rather thin, coloured of 
a fine brown, and placed evenly round the meat 

BEEF STEAKS A LA FRAN^AisE (entr£e) ; (another receipt. 

Cut the beef into small thin stQgks as above, season them with fine 
salt and pepper, dredge them lightly with flour, and fry them in butter 
over a brisk fire ; arrange them in a chain round a very hot dish, and 
pour into the centre a little olive sauce.

This may be cut from one to two inches thick, and the time of stew- 
mg it must be proportioned to its size. Dissolve a slice of butter in a 
large saucepan or stewpan, and brown the steak on both sides, moving 
it often that it may not bum ; then shake in a little flour, and when it 
is coloured pour in by degrees rather more than sufficient broth or water 
to cover the meat When it boils, season it with salt, take off the scam, 
slice in one onion, a carrot or two, and half a turnip; add a small bunch 
of sweet herbs, and stew the steak very softly from two hours and a 
half to three hours. A quarter of an hour before it is served, stir well 
into the gravy three teaspoonsful of rice flour smoothly mixed with a 
little cayenne, half a wineglassful of mushroom catsup, and a slight 
seasoning of spice. A teaspoonful of currie powder, in addition, will 
improve both the flavour and the appearance of the sauce. The onion 
is sometimes browned with the meat; and the quantity is considerably 
increased. Eschalots may be used instead, where their strong flavour 
is approved. A few button-mushrooms, stewed from twenty to thirty 
minutes with the meat, will render the catsup unnecessary. Wine, or 
any fevourite store sauce, can be added at will. 

2} to 3 hours. 

^ FRIED BEEF iFTBASf 

We have little to add here to the directions of page 136, which are 
sufficient to enable the cook to send a dish of fried steaks to table pro- 
perly dressed. Currie sauce, highly onionedf is frequently served 
with them. 

BEEF STEAK STEWED IN ITS OWN orayt; {Good and whohsome.^ 

Trim all the fat and skin from a rump steak of nearly- an inch thick, 
and divide it once or twice ; just dip it into cold water, let it drain lor 
an instant, sprinkle it on both sides with pepper, and then flour it rather 
thickly ; lay it quite flat into a well-tinned iron saucepan or stewpan, 
which has been rinsed with cold water, of .which a tablespoonful should 
be left in it. Place it over (not upon) a very gentle fire, and keep it 
|ust simmering from an hour and a half to an hour and three quarters, 
When, if the meat be good, it will have become perfectly tender. Add 
salt to it when it first begins to boil, and turn it when rather more than 
half done. A couple of spoonsful of gravy, half as much catsup, and a 
slight seasoning of spice, would, to many tastes, improve this dish, of 
which, however, the great recommendation is its wholesome simplicity, 
which renders it suitable to the most delicate stomach. A thick mut- 
ton cutlet from the middle of the leg is excellent dressed thus. 

IJ to 1 j hour. 

BEEF OB MUTTON CAKE; (Vert/ good.) 

Chop two pounds of lean and very tender beef or mutton, with three 
quarters of a pound of beef suet; mix them well, and season them with 
a dessertspoonful of salt, nearly as much pounded cloves, a teaspoonful 
of pounded mace, and half a teaspoonful of cayenne. Line a round 
baking dish with thin slices of fat b^con, press the meat closely into it, 
smooth tlie top, and cover it with bacon, set a plate on it with a weight, 
and bake it two hours and a quarter. Take off the bacon, and serve 
the meat hot, with a little rich brown gravy, or set it by until cold.

this dish can be chopped up with it instead of suet, where it is liked as 
well ; and onion, or eschalot, shred fine, minced savoury herbs, grated

added to vary it in flavour.

24; young turnips, 6; small lump of sugar; white pepper, nearly ^ 
teaspoonful; salt, twice as much: 1^ to 1^ hour. . 

A GOOD ENGLISH STEW. 

On three pounds of tender rump of beef, freed from skin and fat, and 
cut down into two-inch squares, pour rather more than a quart of cold 
broth or gravy. When it boils add salt if required, and a little cayenne, 
and keep it just simmering for a couple of hours ; then put to it the 
grated rind of a large lemon, or of two small ones, and half an hour 
after stir to it a tablespoonful of rice-flour, smoothly mixed with a wine- 
glassful of mushroom catsup, a dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, and a 
teaspoonful of soy : in fifteen minutes it will be ready to serve. A 
glass and a half of port, or of whits>wine, will greatly improve this 
Hew, which may likewise be flavoured with the store-sauce of page 
117, or with another, which we find excellent for the purpose, maide 
with halfa pint of port wine, the same of mushroom-catsup, a quarter-

pint of walnat-piekle, a ttiblespooiilbl of the beet soy, and a de»ert- 
spoonfiil of cayenne-vinegar, all well shaken together and poured into 
a bottle containing the thin rind of a lemon and two fine mellow ancho- 
vies, of moderate size. A few delicately fried fercemeat-balls may be 
slipped into it after it is dished. 

06s. — The limits of onr work will not permit us to devote a fbrther 
space to this class of dishes, but an intelligent cook will find it easy to 
vary them in numberless ways. Mushrooms, celery, carrots, sweet 
herbs, parboiled' new potatoes, green peas, rice, and currie-powder may 
be advantageously used ibr that purpose. Oxtails, just blanched and 
cut into joints, will be found excellent substitutes fbr the beef: mutton 
and veal also may be dressed in the same way. The meat and vege- 
tables can be browned before broth or water is poured to them ; but, 
though perhaps mc^re savoury, the stew will then be much less delieate. 
£acb Aind of vegetable should be allowed something more than suffi- 
cient time to render it perfectly tender, but not so much as would 
reduce it to pulp. 

TO STEW SHIN OF BEEF. 

Wash, and set it on to stew in sufficient cold water to keep it just 
covered until it is done. When it boils, take off the scum, and put an 
ounce and a quarter of salt to the gallon of water. It is usual to add a 
few cloves and some black pepper, slightly bruised and tied up loosely 
in a fold of muslin, two or more onions, a root of celery, a bnuch of 
savoury herbs, four or five carrots, and as many turnips, either whole or 
sliced : if to be served with the meat, the last two will- require a little 
more than the ordinary time of boiling, but otherwise they may be sin>- 
mered with the meat from the beginning. Give the beef from four to 
five hours* gentle stewing ; and serve it with part of its own liquor 
thickened and flavoured, or quite plain. An excellent dish for a fiimily 
may be made by stewing the thick fleshy part of the shin or leg in 
stock made of the knuckle, with a few bits of lean ham, or a slice ot 
hung beef from which the smoked edffes have been care^lly pared 
away, and some spice, salt, and vegetables: by frying these last before 
they are thrown into the soup>pot the savour of the stew will be greatly 
heightened ; and a tureen of good soup may be made of its remains^ 
after it has been served at table. 

Ox-cheek, after having been soaked fbr four or Gtwe hours, and wa^ed 
with great nicety, may be dressed like the shin ; but as it has little fla- 
vour, the gravy should be strained, and quite cleared from fat, then put 
into a clean saucepan, and thickened as soon as it boils, with the fol- 
lowing mixture : — three dessertspoonsful of rice-flour, nearly a wine- 
glassful of catsup, a teaspoonful of currie-powder, or a little powdered 
ginffer and cayenne. When these have stewed for ten niinutes, dish 
the liead, pour tiie sauce over, and serve it. 

Shin of beef! 4 to 5 hours. Ox-cheek, 2 to 3 hours. 

ntBNGH BEEF A LA MODE ; (a comtHon receipt) 

Take seven or eight pounds of a rump of beef (or of any other tender 
jmnt), free from bone, and skewer it firmly into a good shape. Put 
two ounces of butter into a thick saucepan or stewpan, and when ft 
boils stir to it a tablespoonful of flour ; keep these well shaken over a 
gentle fire until they are of a fine amber colour; then lay in the bee^

and brown it on both sides, taking care that it shall not stick to the 
pan. Pour to it by slow degrees, letting each portion boil before the 
nest ib added, or the butter will float upon the surface and be difficult * 
to clear o3^ afterwards, three quarters of a pint of hot water, or gravy ; 
add a bunch of savoury herbs, one large or two small carrots cut in 
thick slices, two or three moderate-sized onions, two bay-leaves, and 
sufficient pepper and salt to season the g^ravy. Let the meat simmer 
gently from lour to five hours, and turn it when it is half done. When 
Teady to serve, Hfl the beef into a hot dish, lay the vegetables round, 
and pour the gravy over it, after having taken out the herbs and 
skimmed away the fat In France, half or the whole of a calf's foot is 
stewed with the bee( which is there generally larded through with 
thick strips of fat bacon. (For larding, see page 139.) Veal dressed 
in this way is even better than beef. The stewpan used for either 
should be as nearly of the size of the meat as possible. 
Beef, 7 to 8 lbs. : 4 to 5 hours. 

STEWED SIRLOIN 01* BEEF. 

As a matter of convenience we have occasionally had this joint 
stewed instead of roasted, and have found it excellent Cut out the 
inside or fillet as entire as possible, and reserve it for a separate dish ; 
then remove the bones with care, or let the butcher do this for you; 
spread the meat fiat on a table and cover the inside with thin slices of 
striped bacon, after having first strewed over it a mixed seasoning of a ^ 
small teaspoonful of salt, half as much mace or nutmeg, and a moderate 
quantity of pepper or cayenne. Roll and bind the meat firmly, lay it 
into a stewpan or thick iron saucepan nearly of its size, and add the 
bones and as much good beef broth as will nearly cover the joint 
Should this not be at hand, put a few slices of lean ham or bacon under 
the beef, and lay round it three pounds of neck or knuckle of veal, or of 
stewing beef, divided into several parts ; then pour to it cold water in- 
stead of broth. In either case, so soon as it has boiled a few minutes 
and been well cleaned from scum, throw in a large faggot of savoury 
herbs, three or &ur carrots, as many leeks, or a large onion, stuck with 
a dozen cloves ; and, an hour later, two blades of mace, and half a 
teaspoonful of peppercorna Stew the beef very gently indeed from 
four to five hours, and longer, should the joint be large : serve it with a 
good Espagnole, sauce piquante, or brown caper sauce. Add what salt 
may be needed before the vegetables are thrown in ; and, afler the meat 
is lifted out, boil down to soup or gravy the liquor in which it has been 
stewed. To many tastes it would be an improvement to fiour and 
brown the outside of the beef in butter before the broth or water is 
poured to it : it may also be stewed (but somewhat longer) half-covered 
with rich gravy, and turned when partially done. Minced eschalots 
may be strewed over the inside before it is rolled, when their strong 
savour is relished, or veal forcemeat may supply their place. 

TO STEW A RUMP OF BEEF. 

This joint is more easily carved, and is of better appearance when 
the bones are removed before it is dressed. Roll and bind it firmly 
cover it with strong cold bsef broth or gravy, and stew it very gently 
indeed from six hours to between seven and eight; add to it, after iliQ

■cum \ma been well cleared ofl( one lar^ or two moderate-fitzed onions

a large faggot of savoury herbs. When the beef is perfectly tender 
quite through, which may be known by probin? it with a sharp thin 
•kewer, remove the fillets of tape, dish it neatly, and serve it with a 
rich Espagnole, and a garnish of forced tomatat, or with a highly flar 
voured bcown English ^^avy, and stewed carrots in the dish: for these 
last the mild preparation of garlic or eschalots, of pa£f6 llO, may be 
substituted with good efiect ; they shoulcl be well dmined^ laid round the 
meat, and a little brown gravv poured over the whole. 

This is the most simple and economical manner of stewing the beef; 
but d^ould a richer one be desired, half roast the joint, and stew it after- 
wards in strong gravy, to which a pint of mushrooms, and a pint of 
sherry or Madeira, should be added an hour before it is ready for table. 
Keep it hot while a portion of the gravy is thickened with a well-made 
brown roux (see Chapter IV., page 96), and seasoned with salt, cay- 
enne, and any other spice it may require. Grarnish it with large balls 
of forcemeat, highly seaso/ied with minced eschalots, rolled in egg and 
bread-crumbe» and fried a fine golden brown.

from 4 to 5 hours.

BE£F PALATEd. (ENTREC.) 

First rub them well with salt, to take off the slime ; then wash them 
thoroughly in several waters, and leave them to soak for half an hour 
before they are dressed. Set them over the fire in cold water, and boil 
them gently until tlie skin will peel o^ and the palates are tolerably 
tender. It is difficult to state the exact time required for this, as some 
will be done enough in two hours and a half, and others in not less than 
from four to five hours. When thus prepared, the palates may be cut 
into various forms, and simmered until fit to serve, in rich brown gravy, 
highly flavoured with ham, cayenne, wine, and lemon-peel; or they 
wul make an excellent currie. As they are very ^nsipid of themselves^ 
they require a sauce of eoEae piquancy, in which, after they have been 
peeled and trimmed, they should be stewed from twe;;nty to thirty min- 
utes, or until they are perfectly tender. The black parts of them miist 
be cut away, when the skin is taken oS, An onion, stuck with a few 
cloves, a carrot sliced, a tea^Kwnful of whole white pepper, a sQice of 
butter, and a teaspoonful of salt, may be boiled with the palates in the 
first instance ; and they will be found very good, if sent to table in the 
curried gravy of Chapter XIV., or in the Soubise of Chapter IV., made 
thinner than the receipts direct.

They should be sent irom the butcher ready jomted. SoUk and wash

and cover them with cold broth or water. As soon as they boil, remove 
the scum, and add a half^teaspoonfizl of salt, or as much more as may he 
needed, and a little common pepper, or cayenne, an onion stuck witb 
half a dozen cloves, two or three small carrots, and a bunch or two of 
parsley. When these have simmered for two hours and a quarter, try 
the meat wkh a fork, and should it not be perfectly tender, let it remain 
over the fire until it is so. Ox-tails sometimes require nearly or quite 
three hours' stewing: they may be served with the vegetables, or with^ 
the gravy strained from them, and thickened like the English stew, of 
page 147.

TO SAI.T AND PICKLE BEEF, IN VARIOUS WAYS. 

Let the meat bang a couple of days in mild weather, and four or 6ve 
in winter, before it is salted or pickled. Durmg the heat of summer it 
is better to immerse it entirely in brine, that it may be secured alike 
from the flies, and from the danger of becoming putrid. Trim it, and 
take out the kernels from the fiit; then rub a little fine dry salt over it, 
and leave it until the following day ; drain it well from the blood, which 
will be found to have flowed from it, and it will be ready ^ any of the 
following modes of curing, which are all excellent of their kind, and 
have been well proved. 

In very cold weather, the salt may be applied quite warm to the 
meat : it should always be perfectly dry, and reduced to powder. 

Saltpetre hardens and renders meat indigestible ; sugar, on the con- 
trary, mellows and improves it much ; and it is more texSer when cured 
with bay salt than when common salt is used for it. 

TO SAUr AND BOIL A ROUND OF BEEF. 

Mix an ounce of saltpetre, finely powdered, with half a pound of very 
coarse sugar, and rvb the beef thoroughly with them ; in two days add 
three-quarters of a pound of common salt, well dried and beaten ; tuna 
and rub the meat well in every part with the pickle for three weeks^ 
when it will be fit to dress. Just wash off the salt, and skewer the beef 
as round tmd as even as possible ; bind it tightly with broad tape, cover 
it with cold water, and let it simmer gently for at least five houra 
Carrots, mashed turnips, or cabbages, are usually served with boiled 
beef; and horseradish stewed for ten minutes in equal parts of vine^r 
and water, then pressed weU from them, and mixed with some rich 
melted butter, is a good sauce for it

Obs, — ^Beef cured by this receipt, if properly boiled, is tender, of 
eood colour and flavour, and not over salt The rump, edge-bone, and 
brisket may be salted, or pickled in the same way as the round. 

HAMBI7ROH PICKLE FOR BEEF, HAMS, AND TONGUE. 

Boil together, for twenty minutes, two gallons of water, three pounds 
of bay salt, two pounds of coarse sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, and 
two of black pepper, bruised, and tied in a fold of muslin ; clear off the 
scum thoroughly, as it rises, pour the pickle into a deep earthen-pan, 
and when it is quite cold lay m the meat, of which every part must be 
perfectly covered with it A moderate-sized round of beef will be 
ready for table in a fortnight; it should be turned occasionally in the 
brine. Five pounds of common salt may be substituted for the quantity 
of bay salt given above ; but the meat will not be so finely flavoured. 

Water, 2 gallons; bay salt, 3 lbs. ; saltpetre, 2 ozs. ; black pepper, 2 
ozs. ; sugar, 2 lb& : 20 minute& 

ANOTHER FICKLE FOR TONGUES, BEEF, AND HAMS. 

To three gallons of spring water add six pounds of common salt, two 
pounds of bay salt, two pounds of common loaf sugar, and two ounces 
of saltpetre. Boil these over a gentle fire, and be carefiil to take off all 
the scum as it rises : when quite cold it will be fit for use. Rub the 
meat to be cured with fine salt, and let it drain for a 'day or two, in 
order to free it fi^m the blood ; then immerse it in the brine, taking 
care that every part of it shall be covered. Young pork should not 
remain more than from three to five days in the pickle; but hams for 
dryinff may be left in it for a fortni^t at least : tongues will be readv 
in ramer less time. Beef may remain firom one week to two, accord- 
ing to its size, and the degree of saltness desired for it A little expe- 
rience will soon teach the exact time required for the different kinds of 
meat When the pickle has been in use for about three months, boil it 
up again gently, and take the scum carefully off Add to it three 
pouads of common salt, four ounces of sugar, and one of saltpetre: it 
will remain good for a year or more. 

Water, 3 gallons ; common salt, 6 lbs. ; bay salt, 2 lbs. ; loaf sugar, 
2 lb& ; saltpetre, 2 ozs. : boil 20 to 30 minutes. 

DUTCH, OR HUNG BEEF. 

For fourteen pounds weight of the round, the rump, or the thick 
fiank of bee^ mix two ounces of saltpetre with the same quantity of 
coarse sugar ; rub the meat with them in every part, and let it remain 
for two days, then add one pound of bay salt, four ounces of common 
salt, and one ounce of ground black pepper. Rub these ingredients 
thoroughly into the beef, and in four days pour over it a pound of trea- 
cle; rub and turn it daily for a fortnight; drain, and send it to be 
smoked. When wanted for table, lay it mto plenty of cold water, boil 
it very slowly, and press it under a heavv weight while hot A slice 
of this beef, from which the edges have been carefiilly trimmed, wii«

the meat at first, and the treacle may fie altogether omitted ; cloves 
and mace, too, may be added in the same proportion as for spioed beef. 

COLLARED BEEF. , 

Only the thinnest part of the flank, or the ribs, which are not so 
generally used for it, will serve conveniently ibr collaring. The first 
of these should be hunff in a damp place for a day or two^ to soften the 
outer skin; then rubbed with coarse sugar, and left for a couple of days; 
when, ibr eight pounds of the meat, one ounce of saltpetre and half a 
pound of salt should be added. In ten diays it will be fit to dresa^ The 
bones and tough iun^* skin must be removed, and the beef sprinkled 
thickly on the under side with parsley and other savoury herbs shred 
small, before it is rolled, which should be done very tightly : it must 
then be secured with a cloth, and bound as closely as possible with 
broad tape. It will require nearly or quite five hours of gentle boiling, 
and should be placed while hot under a weight, or in a press, without 
having the tape and cloth removed.

Mix half an ounce of saltpetre with the same quantity of pepper, four 
ounces of bay salt, and four of common salt ; with these rub well from 
six to seven pounds of the thin flank, and in tour days add seven ounces 
of treacle ; turn the beef daily in the pickle for a week or more ; dip it 
into water, bone it and skin the inside, roll and bind it up very tightly,, 
lay it into cold watier, and boil it for three hours and a half. We have 
found beef dressed by this receipt extremely good: herbs can, of course, 
be added to it as usual. Spices and juniper berries would to many 
tastes improve it, but we give the receipt simply as we have been ac« 
customed to have it used.

dered ; the saltpetre rubbed first equally over the meat, and the sail? 
next applied in every part It ^onld be rubbed thoroughly with the

06«.— We have not ourselves tested this receipt, but the meat cured 
by it has received such high commendations from several of our friends 
who have partaken of it frequently, that we ihink we may safely insert 
it without The proportion of allspice appears to us more than would 
be agreeable to many tastes, and we would rather recommend that part 
of it should be omitted, and that a portion of nutmeg, mace, and cloves 
should be substituted for it ; as we have found these spices to answer 
well in the following receipt. 

SPICED BEEF ; {ffood and wholesome,) 

For twelve pounds of the round, rump, or thick flank of bee( take a 
large teaspoouiul of freshly-pounded mace, and of ground black pepper, 
twice as much of cloves, one small nutmeg, and a quarter teaspoonful 
of cayenne, all in the finest powder. Mix them toell with seven ounces 
of brown sugar, rub the beef with them and let it lie three days; add 
to it then hsuf a pound of fine salt, and rub and turn it once in twenty- 
four hours for twelve days. Just wash, but do not soak it ; skewer, or 
bind it into good form, put it into a stewpan or saucepan nearly of its 
size, pour to it a pint and a half of good beef broth, and when it begins 
to boil, take off the scum, and throw in one small onion, a moderate^ 
sized &^got of thyme and parsley, and two large, or four small carrots. 
Let it smimer quite softly for four hours and a half, and if not wanted 
to serve hot, leave it in its own liquor until it is nearly cold. This is 
an excellent and far more wholesome dish than the hard, bright- 
coloured beef which is cured with large quantities of salt and Kdtpetre: 
two or three ounces of juniper-berries may be added to it with the spice, 
to heighten its flavour. 

Boef, 12 lbs. ; sugar, 7 ozs. ; mace and black pepper, each, 1 large 
teaspoonful; cloves, in powder, 1 large dessertspoonfiil ; nutmeg, 1; 
cayenne, ^ teaspoonful: 3 days. Fine salt ^ lb. : 12 days. Beef broth 
(or bouillon), l| pint; onion, 1 small; bunch of herbs; carrots, 2 large, 
or 4 small : stewed 4^ hours. 

Obs, — We give this receipt exactly as we have often had it used', but 
eelery and turnips might be added to the gravy; and when tiie appear- 
ance of the meat is much considered, three-quarters of an ounce of salt- 
petre may be mixed with the spices; the beef may also be plainly boiled 
m water only, with a few vegetables, or baked in a deep pan with a 
little gravy. No meat must ever be left to cool in the stewpan or sauce- 
pan in which it \b cooked; it must be lifted into a pan of its own depth» 
and the liquor poured upon it

A MINIATUKE ROUHD OF BESF. 

** Select a fine rib of beef, and have it cut small or large u> width, 
according to your taste ; it may thus be made to weigh from five to 
twelve pounds, or more. Takt out the bone, and wrap the meat round 
like a fillet of^veal, securing it with two or three wooden sk/^^wers; 
place it in a strong pickle for four or ^ve daprst aiid then cook it, taking 
care that it does not boil, but only simmers from forty minutes, or more, 
according to its size. It is best to put it on in hot water, as it will not 
draw the gravy so much as cold. Many persons adjust a rib of beef in 
this way for roasting : let them try it saiteid, and they need not envy the 
possessor of the finest round of beef." We give the receipt to our read- 
ers in its original form, and we can assure them, firom our own experi- 
ence, that it i» a good one ; but we would recommend that, in dressing 
the meat, quite the usual time for each pound of it should be allowed. 
When boned and rolled at the butcher's, the skewers should be removed 
when it is first brought in ; it should be well wiped with a dry cloth, or 
washed with a little fresh brine, and a small quantity of salt and salt- 
petre should be rubbed over the inside ; it may then be firmly bound 
with tape, and will be quite ready to boil when taken frqm the pickle. 
The sirloin, after the inside fillet is removed, may be cured and dressed 
in the same way, and will be found super-excellent, if the beef be well 
fiitted and properly kept- The Hamburg pickle (pee page 152,) is per- 
haps the best for these joints. Part of the rump, taken clear of bone, 
answers admirably when prepared by this receipt 

BEEF EOLL, OR, CAHELLON DE BCEUF. (ENTREE.) 

Chop and mix thoroughly two pounds of lean and very tender beei^ 
with one pound of slightly striped liacon; season them with a large tea- 
spoonful of pepper, a little salt, a s*nall nutmeg, or two-thirds as much 
of mace, the grated rind of a lemon, or a teaspoonful of thyme and pars- 
ley finely minced. Form the whole into a thick rouleau, wrap a but- 
tered paper round it, enclose it in a paste made of flour and water, and 
send it to a moderate oven for a couple of hours. Remove the paper 
and the crust, and serve the meat with a little brown gravy. Lamb 
and veal are excellent dressed in this way, particularly when mixed 
with plenty of mushrooms. Brown cucumber sauce should be served 
with the lamb ; and currie, or oyster sauce, when there are no mush- 
rooms, with the veal. A flavourinff of onion or of eschalot, where it is 
liked, can be added at pleasure to the beef; suet, or the fiit of the meat, 
may be substituted for the bacon.

from ten to t\Yelve minutes, and then, should it be too dry, add a little 
boiling water, broth, or gravy ; stew it two minutes longer, and serve it 
directly.

Make a little brown thickening (see paffe ^2) with about an ounce 
and a half of butter, and a dessertspoonful or flour ; when it begins to be 
coloured, shake lightly into it a laige teaspoonful of fioely-shrS parsley 
or mixed savoury herbs, two*thinls as much of salt, and half the quan- 
tity of pepper. Keep these stirred over a gentle fire until the thicken- 
ing is of a deep yellow brown ; then add a pound of rum|>-steak, finely 
mmced, and keep it well separated with a fork until it is quite hot ; next 
pour to it gradually half a cupfiil of boiling water, and Stew the col lops 
very gently for ten minutes. Before they are served, stir to them a 
little catsup. Chili vinegar, or lemon-juice : a small quantity of minced 
onion, eschalot, or a particle of garlic, may be added at first to the thick- 
ening when the flavour is not objected to.

raw state, into small jars, and pour on the top some clarified butter. 
When wanted for use, put the clarified butter into a fi'ying-pan, and 
slice some onions into the pan and fry them. Add a little water to them, 
and then put in the minced meat Stew it well, and in a few minutes 
it will be fit to serve.*' 

BEEF TONOUBB. 

These may be cured by any of the receipts which we have already 
given for pickling beef, or for those which will be found fqrther on for 
hams and^ bacon. Some persons prefer them cored with salt and salt- 
petre only, and dried naturally in a cool and airy room. For such of 
our readers as like them highly and richly flavoured we give our own 
method of having them prepared, which is this : — *^ Rub over the tongue 
a handful of fine salt, and let it drain until the following day; then, 
should it weigh ftom seven to eight pounds, mix thoroughly an ounce 
of saltpetre, two ounces of the coarsest sugar, and half an ounce of black 
pepper ; when the tongue has been well rubbed with these, add three 
ounces of bruised juniper*berries; and when it has laid two days, eight 
ounces of bay salt, dried and pounded ; at the end of three days more, 
pour on it half a pound of treacle, and let it remain in the pickle a fort- 
night after this ; then hang it to drain, fold it in brown paper, and send 
it to be smoked over a wood fire for two or three wee^ Should the 
peculiar flavour of the juniper-berries prevail too much, or be disa]>- 
proved, they may be in part, or altogether, omitted ; and six ounces of 
sugar may be rubbed into the tongue in the first instance when it is 
liked better than treacle. 

Tongue, 7 to 8 Iba ; saltpetre, 1 oz. ; black pepper, ^ oz.; sugar, 3 
ozs. ; juniper-berries, 8 ozs. : 2 days. Bay salt, 8 ozs. : 3 days. Trea- 
cle, i lb. : 14 days.

appearance, should be trimmed away : it is indeed usual to take the root 
un entirely, but some families prefer it lefl; on for the sake of the flit

VEE9 TONGvm ; (a SuffoUc receipt) 

For each very large tongue, mix with half a pound of salt two ounces 
of saltpetre and ttiree-quarters of a pgund of the coarsest sugar; rub the 
tonfi^ues daily, and turn them in the pickle for ^\e weeks, when they 
will be fit to be dressed, or to be smoked.

TO DRB88 BEEF TONOVES. 

When taken fresh from the pickle they require no soaking utAeas 
they should hare remained in it much beyond the usual time, or have 
been cured with a more than common proportion of salt ; but when they 
have been smoked and hung fbr some time, they should be laid for two 
or three hours in cold, and as mnch longer in tepid water, before they 
are dressed : if extremely dry, ten or twelve hours must be allowed to 
soften them, and they snould always be brought very slowly to boiL 
Tw^o or three carrots and a large bunch of savoury herbs, added after 
the scum is cleared off, will improve them. ' They should be simmered 
until they are extremely tender, when the skin will peel from them 
easily. A highly dried tongue will usually require from three and a 
half to four hours' boiling ; an nnsmoked one, about an hour less ; and 
for one which has not been salted at all, a shorter time will suffice. 

TO ROAST A BEEF HEART. 

Wash and soak the heart very thoroughly, cut away the lobes, fill 
the cavities with a veal forcemeat (No. 1, page 126), secure it well 
with a needle and twine, or very coarse thread, and roast it at a good 
fire for an hour and a half, keeping it basted plentifully with butter. 
Pour mehed butter over it, after it is dished, and send it to table as hot 
as possible. Many persons boil the heart for three quarters of an hour 
before it is put to the fire, and this is said to render it more delicate eat- 
ing; the time of roasting must of course be proportionately diminished* 
Gocxf brown gravy may be substituted for the melted butter, and cur- 
rant jelly also may be served with it 

1§ hour, or more. 

BEEF KIDNEY. 

Trim, and cut the kidney into slices; season them with salt and 
pepper, and dredge them well with flour ; fry them on both sides, and 
when they are d^e through, lift them ont, empty the pan, and make a 
gravy for them with a small slice of butter, a dessertspocwiy of flcnur, 
pepper and salt, and a cup of boiling water; shake these round and ^ive 
them a minute^s simmering : add a little mushroom catsup, lemon-juice, 
eschalot vinegar, or any store sauce that will give a good flavour. 
Minced herbs are to many tastes an improvement to this dish, to which 
a small quantity of onion shred fine can be added when it is liked. 

6 to 9 minutes. 

AS EaLCELLENT HASH OF COLD BEEF. 

Put a slice of butter into a thick saucepan, and whcfn it boils throw 
in a dessertspoonful of minced herbs, and an onion (or two or three 
eschalots) shred small : shake them over the fire until lightly browned, 
then stir in a tablespoonfiil of flour, a little cayenne, some mace or nut- 
meg, and half a tea«poonful of salt When the whole is well colouredL

168 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP. YUU 

pour to it three ouarters of a pint or more of broth or gravy, according^ 
to the quantity or meat to be served in it. Let this trail gently for fi& 
teen minutes; then strain it; add ba^^ & wineglassful of mushroom or 
of compound catsup; lay in the meat, and keep it by the side of the fire 
until it is heated through and is on the point of simmering, but be sure 
not to let it boiL Put some fried or toasted sippets into a very hot dish, 
and serve the hash directly. 

▲ COMMON HASH OF COLD BEEF OR MTrTOlf. 

Take the meat from the bones, slice it small, trim off the brown edges, 
and stew down the trimmings with the bones well broken, an onion, a 
bimch of thyme and parsley, a carrot cut into thick slices, a few pepper- 
corns, four cloves, some -salt, and a pint and a half of water. When 
this is reduced to little more than three-quarters of a pint, strain it^ 
clear it from the fat, thicken it with a large dessertspoonflil of rice 
flour, or rather less of arrow-root ; add salt and pepper if needed, boil 
the whole for a few minutes, then lay in the meat and heat it well. 
Boiled potatoes are sometimes sliced hot into a very common hash. 

Obs. — ^The cook should be reminded that if the meat in a hash or 
mince be allowed to boil, it will immediately become hard, and can then 
only be rendered eatable by very long- sievoing^ which is by no means 
desirable for meat which is already sufficiently done. 

BRESLAW OF BEEF; (jgood,) 

Trim the brown edges from half a pound of underdressed roast bee^ 
shred it small, and mix it with four ounces of fine bread-crumbs, a tea^- 
spoonful of minced parsley, and two-thirds as much of thyme, two ounces 
of butter broken small, half a cupfiil of gravy or cream, a high season- 
ing of pepper and cayenne, and mace, or nutmeg, a small teaspoonful of 
salt, and three large eggs, well beaten. Melt a little butter in a pie 
dish, pour in the beef, and bake it half an hour; turn it out, and send it 
to table with brown gravy in a tureen. When cream or gravy is not 
at hand, an additional egg or two, and rather liiore butter, must be used. 
We think that grated lemon-rind improves the breslaw. A portion of 
fiit fix)m the joint can be added where it is liked. The mixture is some- 
times baked in buttered cups. 

Beef, \ lb. ; bread-crumbs, 4 ozs. ; butter, 2 ozs. ; gravy or cream, ^

NORMAN HASH. 

Peel and fry two dozens of button onions in butter until they are 
lightly browned, then stir to them a tablespoonful of flour, and when 
the whole is of a deep amber shade, pour in a glass and a half of red 
wine, and a large cup of boiling broth or water ; add a seasoning of 
salt and common pepper, or cayenne, and a little lemon-pickle, catsup, 
or lemon-juice, and boil the whole until the onions are quite tender; 
cut and trim into small handsome slices the remains of either a roast or 
boiled joint of bee^ and arrange them in a clean saucepan ; pour the 
gravy and onions on them, and let them stand for awhile to imbibe the 
flavour of the sauce ; then place the hash near the fire, and when it is 
thoroughly hot serve it immediately, without allowing it to boiL

FRSHOH BBCBIFT FOR HASHED BOITIUiL 

Shake over a elow fire a bit of butter the size of an egg, and a table- 
rpoonful of flour; when they have simmered for a minute, stir to them 
a little finely-chopped onion, and a dessertspoonful of minced parsley; 
BO soon as the whole is equally browned, add suflScient pepper, salt, and 
nutmeg to season the hash properly, and firom half to three-quarters of 
a pint of boiling water or of bouillon. Put in the beef cut into small 
but thick slices; let it stand by the fire and heat gradually; and when 
near the point of boiling thicken the sauce with the yolks of three eggs, 
mixed with a tablespoonfiil of lemon-juice. For change, omit the effga, 
and substitute a tablespoonful of catsup, and another of pickled gher- 
kins [small cucumbers], minced or sliced. 

BAKED MINCBD BEEF. 

Mince tolerably fine, with a moderate proportion of its own fat, as 
much of the inside of a cold roast joint as will suffice for a dish : that 
which is least done is best for the purpose. Season it rather highly 
with cayenne and mace, or nutmeg, and moderately with salt ; add, 
when they are liked, one or two eschalots, minced small, with a few 
chopped mushrooms, either fresh or pickled, or two tablespoonsful of 
mushroom catsup. Moisten the whole, mixing it well, with a cupfvd 
of good gravy, and put it into a deep dish. Place on the top an inch- 
thick layer of bread-crumbs ; moisten these plentifully with clarified 
butter, passed through a small strainer over them, and send the mince 
to a slow oven for twenty minutes, or brown it in a Dutch oven. 

TO BOIL MARBOWJIONES. 

Let the large ends of the bones be sawed by the butcher, so that 
when they are dished they may stand upright ; and if it can be done 
conveniently, let them be placed in the same manner in the vessel in 
which they are boiled. Put a bit of paste, made with flour and water, 
over the ends where the marrow is visible, and tie a cloth tightly over 
them ; take the paste off before the bones are sent to table, and serve 
them, placed upright in a napkin, with slices of dry toasted bread, apart 
When not wanted for immediate use, they may be partially boiled, and 
set into a cool place, where they will remain good for many days. 

Large marrow bones, 2 hours; moderate sized, 1^ hour. Ix) keep: 
boil them*! i hour, and from ^ to j hour more when wanted for table. 

BAKED MARROW BONES. 

When the bones have been sawed to the length of a deep pie dish, 
wash and wipe them dry, lay them into it, and cover them entirely with 
a good batter. Send them to a moderate oven for an hour or more, and 
serve them in the batter. 

CLARIFIED MARROW FOR KEEPINO. 

Take the marrow from the bones while it is as fresh as possible ; cut 
it small, put it into a very clean jar, and melt it with a gentle heat, 
either in a pan of water placed over the fire, or at the mouth of a cool 
oven ; strain it through a muslin, let it settle for a minute or two, and 
pour it, clear of sediment, into small jars. Tie skins, or double folds 
of thick paper, over them as soon as the marrow is cold, and store it in 
a cool place. It will remain good for months.

Veal riiouM be Ikt, finely grained, w4iite, firm, and not overgrown : 
fx when very large it is apt to be coarte and tough. It is more diffi- 
cult to keep than any other meat except pork, and should never be 
allowed to acquire the slighteet taint before it is dressed, as any ap- 
proach to putridity renders it equally unwholesome and ofiensive to the 
taste. The fillet, the loin, the shoulder, and the best end of the neck, 
are the parts generally selected for roasting ; the breast and knuckle 
are more usually stewed or boiled. The udder, or firm white fiit of the 
fillet, is much used by French cooks instead of butter, especially in the 
composition of their forcemeats : for these, it is first well boiled, then 
left until quite cold, and afterwards thoroughly pounded before it is 
mixed with the other inched ients. The head and feet of the calf are 
valuable articles of food, both for the nutriment which the gelatinous 
parts of them afibrd, and for the great variety of modes in which they 
may be dressed. The kidneys, with the rich fat that surrounds them, 
and the sweetbreads especially, are well known delicacies^ the liv^ 
and the heart also are very good eatingf ; and no meat is so generally 
useful for rich soups and gravies as veal. 

TO TAKE THE HAIR RtOM A CALF*S HEAD WITH THE SKIN ON. 

It is better to do this before the head is divided ; but if only the half 
of one with the skin on can be procured, it must be managed in the 
same way. Put it into plenty of water which is on the point of sim- 
mering, but which does not positively boil, and let it remain in until it 
does 60, and for Qye or six minutes after^^^ids, hut at the first full bub- 
ble draw it from the fire and let it merely scakl; then lift it out, and 
wi^th a knife that is rutt sharp scrape (^ the hair as closely and as 
quickly as possible. The butchers have an instrument on purpose for 
the operation ; but we have bad the head look quite as well when done 
in the manner we have just described, as when it has bei^n sent in. 
ready prepared by them. After the hair is ofi^ the bead should be wdl

washed, and if it cannot be cooked the same day, it mast be wiped ex* 
tremely dry before it is hung up ; and when it has not been divided, it 
should be left whole until the time approaches for dressing it The 
brain must then be taken out, and both that and the head well soaked 
and washed with the greatest nicety. When the half head oolj is 
scalded, the brain should first be removed. Calves' feet are freed nrom 
the hair easily in the same manner ; indeed, we find it a better mode 
of having it cleared from them than the one we have given in Chapter 
XX., though that is practised by many good butchers. 

BOILED CAIiF's HEAD. 

When the head is dressed with the skin on, which many persona 
prefer, the ear must be cut ofi* quite close to it ; it will require three 
quarters of an hour or upwards of additional boiling, and should be 
served covered with fried crumbs : the more usual mode, however, is 
to boil it without the skin. In either case, first remove tlie brain, wash 
the head delicately clean, and soak it for a quarter of an hour; cover it 
plentifully with cold water, remove the scum as it rises with jBTreat 
care, throw in a little salt, and boil the head gently until it is per&ctly 
tender. In the mean time, wash and soak the brains first in cold and 
then in warm water, remove the skin or film, boil tliem in a small 
saucepan from fourteen to sixteen minutes, acceding to their size, and 
when they are done, chop and mix them with eight or ten Ba.ee leaves 
boiled tender, and finely minced, or, if preferred, with parsley boiled 
instead ; warm them in a spoonful or two of melted butter, or white 
sauce ; skin the tongue, trim ofi* the root, and serve it in a small dish 
with the brains laid round it Send the head to table very hot, with 
parsley and butter poured over it, and some more in a tureen. A cheek 
of bacon, or very delicate pickled pork, and greens, are the usual ac- 
companiments to boiled calf's head. 

We have given here the common English mode of serving this dish, 
by some epicures considered the best, and by others, as exceedingly 
insipid. On the Continent, tomata sauce takes the place of the parsley 
and butter ; and rich oyster or Dutch sauce are varieties oflen substi- 
tuted for it in this country. 

With the skin on, from 2^ to 2 j hours ; without the skin, from 1| to 
1 J hour. 

calf's head, the warder's way; (an excellent receipt,) 

Boil the half^head until tolerably tender; let it cool, and bone it 
entirely ; replace the brain, lay the head into a stewpan, and simmer 
it gently for an hour in rich gravy. From five and twenty to thirty 
minutes before it is dished, add, if procurable, half a pint of mushroom- 
buttons. Thicken the eravy, if needful, with rice-nour, or with flour 
and butter, and serve plenty of forcemeat-balls round the head. For 
dishes of this kind, a little sweet-basil wine, or a few sprigs of the herb 
itself, impart a very agreeable flavour. When neither these nor mush- 
rooms are within reach, the very thin rind of a small but fresh lemon 
may be boiled in the gravy, and the strained juice added at the instant 
of serving. 

Boiled from 1 to 2 hours ; stewed 1 hour.

pREPARJED CALF*8 HEAD ; (^thc Cook^$ receipt.) 

Take away the brains and tongtie from the half o£ a cairs head, ajid 
Ihen remove the bones, being careful in doing ae to keep the knile as 
close to them as poflsible, and to avoid piercing the otttar s^in : m this 
cionsists the whole art of boning, in which an attentive cook may easily 
render herself expert Next wash the bead and dry it in a clean cloth; 
sprinkle over the inside a little pounded mace and cayenne, or white 
pepper ; roll it up tightly, and bind it round with tape or twine. Lay 
mto a small stewpot three or four pounds of neck of veal or of bee( 
twice or thrice divided, and place the head upon it wit^ the bones weH 
broken ; pour in half a gallon of cold water, or as much as will suffice 
to keep the head covered until it is done, and simmer it very gently 
from an hour and a quarter to an hour and three quarters. When it is 
extremely tender, lift it out, and if wanted for table, remove the bind- 
ing, and serve it very hot, with currie sauce, rich oyster sauce, or egg 
sauce and brown grav^ ; but should the remains, or the whole of it fa« 
required for the f(3lowing receipts, pour no gravy over it : in the latter 
case do not take off the tape for several hours. The tongue may be 
stewed with the head, but will require rather less time. We do not 
think it neediul to repeat in every receipt our directions for adding salt 
to, and removing carefully the scum from, meats that are stewed or 
boiled, but the cook must not neglect cither. When the trouble of 
boning is objected to, it can be dispensed with for some of the dishes 
which follow, but not for all. After the head is taken out, boil the 
gravy until it is well reduced, and rich : it should be strongly jellied 
when cold. A bone of ham, or a slice of hun? beef will much improve 
its ftavour ; but vegetables must be avoided if it be wanted to keep : a 
little spice and a faggot of parsley may be added to it, and a calf's foot 
will be sure to give it the requisite degree of firmness. This receipt 
is for a head without the skin. 

HASHED calf's HEAD. 

When the whole of this dish has to be prepared, make for it a quart 
of stock, and proceed in all else as in making mock turtle soup; 
but after the bead has been parboiled, cut down a full pound and 
a half of it for the hash, and slice it small and thick, instead of dividing 
it into dice. Make the brains into cakes (see page 126), and gai^ 
nish the dish with forcemeat balls, rolled in egg, and in the finest 
bread-crumbs, then fried a delicate brown, and well drained, and dried 
upon a warm sieve reversed. The wine and other seasonings should 
be the same as for the soup. 

Rich gravy, 1 quart; flesh of calfs head, full 1} lb.; wine, and 
Dther seasonings, as for mock turtle soup. 

Obs. — The gravy for this hash should be stewed with ham, eschalots, 
&c., exactly as for the soup. 

CHEAP HASH OF CALF's HEAD. 

Take the flesh from the bone of a cold boiled head, and put it aside 
until wanted ; lake about three pints of the liquor in which it was

cocked ; break the bones, and etew them down wiCh a small 1)UDcfa of 
savoury herbs, a carrot, or two should they be soDall, a little careftillj 
fried onion, four cloves, a dozen corns of pepper, and either a slice or 
two of lean unboiled ham, or the bone of a boiled one, quite cleared of 
flesh, well bruised and broken, and freed carefully from any of the 
smoked oatsides. If neither of these can be had, worn half to a whole 
pGNind of neck of beef should be stewed with the bones, or the whole 
will be insipid in flavour. When the lionid is reduced nearly haM^ 
strain it, take off the fat, thickei^it with a little well-made roox, or, if 
more convenient, with flour and butter, stirred into it when it boils, or 
with rice flour or arrow-root, mixed with a little spice, mushroom cat* 
sap, or Harvey's sauce, and a small quantity of lemon pickle or Chili 
yinegar. Heat the meat slowly in the sauce when it is ready, but do 
not allow it to boil. The forcemeat, No, 1. of Chapter VI., may be 
rolled into .balls, fried, and served round ift The gravy should be %DeU 
seasoned. 

TO DRESS COLD CALF*S HEAD OR VEAL A LA MAPFRE D'hOTEL. (gOOD.) 

{English receipt.) 

Cut into small delicate slices, or into scollope of equal size, snffieient 
cold cairs head or veal for a dish. Next knead very smoothly together 
wilii a knife two ounces of batter, and a small dessertspoonful cf flour ; 
pat these into a stewpan &r well-tinned saucepan, and keep them stirred 
or shaken over a gentle fire until they have simmered fi>r a minute or 
two, but do not let them take the slightest colour ; then add to them in 
very small portbns (letting the sauce boil up after each is poured in) 
half a pint of pale veal gravy, or of good shin-of-beef stock, and when 
the whole is very smoothly blended, and has boiled for a couple of mi- 
Dotes, mix together and stir to it a tablespoonfol of common vinegar, & 
dessertqxmnfol of Chili vinegar, a little cayenne, a taMespoonml of 
good mushroom catsup, and a very tmaU bit of sugar ; and when the 
sauce again boils, strew a tablespoonful of mincra parsley over the 
meat, lay it in, and let it stand by the fire until it is quite heated 
through, but do not allow it to boil : if kept just at the simmering point 
fat ten or twelve minutes, it may be served perfectly hot without. The 
addition of the mushroom catsup converts this into an English sauce, 
and renders if in colour, as well as in flavour, unlike the French one 
which bears the same name, and which is acidulated generally with 
lemon-juice instead of vinegar. Pickled mushrooms are sometimes 
added to the dish : the parsley when it is objected to may be omitted, 
and the yolks of two or three e^gs mixed with a little cream may be 
stirred in, but not allowed to boil, just before the meat is served. When 
veal is used for this hash instead of calf *s head, it should be cut into 
slices not much larger than a twenty-five cent piece, and freed entirely 
from fikt, sinew, and the brown edges. When neither broth nor gravy 
is at hand, a morsel or two of lean ham, and a few of the trimmings or 
bones of the head or joint, may be boiled down to supply its olace. 

Sufficient cold calf's head, or meat, for a dish ; butter, 2 ozs. ; floor, 
1 small dessertspoonful ; gravy, or strong broth, ^ pint ; vinegar, and 
mushroom catsup, of each 1 tablespoonful ; Chili vinegar, 1 dessert^

CALF*8 HEAD BRAWN; (authoT* 8 receipt) 

The half of a fine large calf's head, with the skin on, will best an- 
swer for this brawn. Take out the brains, and bone it entirely, or get 
the butcher to do this; rub a littJe fine salt over, and let it drain for ten 
or twelve hours ; next wipe it dry, and rub it well in every part with 
three-quarters of an ounce of saltpetre finely powdered (or ^th an ounce 
should the head be very large) and mixed with four ounces of common 
salt, and three of bay salt, also beaten fine ; turn the head daily in this 
pickle for four or five days, rubbing it a little each time ; and then pour 
over it four ounces of treacle, and continue to turn it every day, and 
baste it with the brine very frequently for a month. Hang it up for a 
night to drain, fold it in brown paper, and send it to be smoked where 
wood only is burned, from three to four weeks. When wanted for table, 
wash and scrape it very clean, but do not soak it; lay it, with the rind 
downwards, into a saucepan or stewpan, which will hold it easily; cover 
it well with cold water, as it will swell considerably in the cooking; let 
it heat rather slowlv, skim it thoroughly when it first begins to simmer, 
and boil it as gently as possible from an hour and three-quarters to a 
couple of hours, or more, should it not then be perfectly tender quite 
through ; for unless sufficiently boiled, the skin, which greatly resem- 
bles brawn, will be unpleasantly tough when cold. When the fleshy 
side of the head is done, which will be twenty minutes or half an hour 
sooner than the outside, pour the water from it, leaving so much onl^ 
in the stewpan as will jast cover the gelatinous part, and simmer it 
until this is thoroughly tender. The head thus cured is very highly 
flavoured, and most excellent eating. The receipt for it is entirely 
new, having originated with ourselves. We give the reader, in addi- 
tion, the result of our first experiment with it, which was exceedingly 
successful:— *' A half calf's head, not very large, without the sSn, 
pickled with three ounces of common salt, two of &y salt, half ah oonce 
of saltpetre, one ounce of brown sugar, and half an ounce of pepper, left 
four days ; then three ounces of treacle added, and the pickling continued 
for a month ; smoked nearly as long, and boiled between one hour and 
a half, and two hours." The pepper was omitted in our second trial, 
because it did not improve the appearance of the dish, although it was 
an advantage in point of flavour. Juniper-berries might, we think, be 
added with advantage, when they are liked; and cayenne tied in a 
muslin might supply the place of the pepper. It is an infinite improve^ 
ment to have the skin of the head left on. 

TO ROAST A FILLET OF VEAL. 

Take out the bone and put a good roll of forcemeat (No. 1, page 122) 
under the flap, dividing first, with a sharp knife, the skin from the meat 
sufficiently to admit the quantity required ; secure it well, truss the veal 
firmly into good shape, place it at a distance fi*om the fire at first, and 
baste it with butter. The outside will have a richer crust of browning 
if the meat be washed, wiped tolerably dry, and well floured before it 
is laid to the fire. It should be carefully watched, and basted often, 
(hat the fat may not bum. Pour melted butter over it after it is dished, 



aad «erve witli it a liolled cheek of bacon t^ a lem<»i. Rout it fiaa 
tiiree hours and a half, to four hours and a hal^ according to its size. 

BOILED FILLET OF VEAL. 

A small and delicately white fillet should be selected for this purpose. 
Bind it round with tape, after having washed it thoroughly; cover it 
well with cold water, aiid bring it gently to boil ; wateh, and clear off 
carefully, the scum as it rises, and be, at the same time, very cautiout 
not to allovv the water to become smoked. Let the meat be gentlif «m»p 
tnered from three hours and a half to four and a half, accoMing to its 
weight Send it to table with rich white sauce, and a boiled tongue ; 
or make for it in the first instance the oyster forcemeat of ChapterVI.« 
and serve with the veal a tureen of well-made oyster sauce. 

Sj to 4} hours. 

ROAST LOOI OF WAI^ 

It is not usual to stuflT a l<Hn of veal, but we greatly recommend dM 
pmctice, as an infinite improvement to die joint Make the same force- 
meat as f(M* the fillet ; and insert it between the skin and the ilesfa just 
over the ends of the bone& Skew^ down the flap, place the joint at « 
moderate distance from a sound fire, keep it constantly basted, and. be 
especially careful not to allow the kidney fat to bum : to prevent this, 
•od to ensure the good appearance of liie joint, a buttered pap» is often 
fiistened round the loin, and removed alx>ut half an hour before it ii 
taken from the fire. It is the fashion in some counties to serve egg^ 
mnuee and brown gravy with roast loin, or breast of veal. 

The cook will scarcely need to be told that she must separate the 
iddn from the flank, with a sharp knife, quite from the end, to the place 
where the forcemeat is to be put, and then skewer the whole very se- 
curely. When the veal is not papered, dredge it well with flour soon 
afler it is laid to the fire. 

2 to 2^ hours. 

BOILED LOIN OF TEAL. 

If dressed with care and served with good sauces, this, when the meat 
18 small and white, is an excellent dish, and often more acceptable to 
persons of delicate habit than roast veal. Take from eight to ten pounds 
of the best end of the loin, leave the kidney in with all its &t, skewer 
or bind down the flap, lay the meat into cold water, and boil it as gently 
as possible from two hours and a quarter to two and a haH^ clearing on 
the scum perfectly, as in dressing the fillet Send it to table with well- 
made oyster sauce, or bechamel, or with white sauce well flavoured 
with lemon-juice^ and with parsley, boiled, pressed dry, and finely 
chopped. 

2^ to 2i hours. 

tfrKWED LOIN OF VEAL. 

Take part of a loin of veal, the chump end will do ; put into a large, 
thick, well-tinned iron saucepan, or into a stewpan, about a couple c^ 
ounces of butter, and shake it over a moderate fire until it begins to 
brown ; flour the veal well all over, lay it into the saucepan, and when 
it is of a fine, equal light-brown, pour gradually in veal broth, gravy, 
or boiling water to nearly half its depth ; add a little salt, one or two 
iJUced carrots, a small oQion, ch: more when the flavour is much liked* 



166. lEODERN COOKERY. [cHAP. IX. 

and a banch of parsley ; stew the veal very softly for an hoar or rather 
more; then turn it, and let it stew for nearly or quite another hour, or 
longer should it not appear perfectly done. As none of our receipts 
have been tried with large, coarse veal, the cooking must be regulated 
by that circumstance, and longer time allowed should the meat be of 
more than middling size. Dish the joint ; skim all the fat from the 
gravy, and strain it over the meat ; or keep the joint hot while it is 
rapidly reduced to a richer consistency. This is merely a plain fiunily 
stew. 

BOILED BREAST OF VEAL. 

Let both the veal and the sweetbread be washed with exceeding 
nicety, cover them with cold water, clear off the scum as it rises, throw 
in a little salt, add a bunch of parsley, a large blade of mace, and twenty 
white peppercorns; simmer the meat from an hour to an hour and a 
quarter, and serve it covered with rich onion sauce. Send it to table 
very hot The sweetbread may be taken up when half done, and cur- 
ried, or made into cutlets, or stewed in brown gravy. When onions 
are objected to, substitute white sauce and a cheek of bacon for them, 
or parsley and butter, if preferred to it 

1 to l| hour. 

TO BOAST A BBBA8T OF VEAL. 

Let the caul remain skewered over the joint till within half an hour 
of its being ready for table ; place it at a moderate distance from a 
brisk fire, baste it constantly, and in about an hour and a half remove 
the caul, flour the joint, and let it brown. Dish and pour melted butter 
over it, and serve it with a cut lemon, and any other of the usual ac- 
companiments to veal. It may be garnished with fried balls of the 
forcemeat (No. 1, Chapter VI.), about the size of a walnut. 

2 to 2^ hours. 

TO BONE A 8HOVLDER OF VEAL, MUTTON OR LAHB. 

Spread a clean cloth upon a table or dresser, and lay the joint flat 
apon it, with the skin downwards; with a sharp knife cut ofi* the flesh 

from the inner side, nearly down to the blade 
bone, of which detach the edges first, then 
work the knife under it, keeping it always 
close to the bone, and using all possible pre- 
caution not to pierce the outer skin ; when 
it is in every part separated from the flesh, 
loosen it from the socket with the point of 
Shoulder of Veal or Mutton, the knife, and remove it ; or, without di- 
boned and rolled. viding the two bones, cut round the joint 

until it is freed entirely from the meat, and proceed to detach the second 
bone. That of the knuckle is frequently left in, but for some dishes it 
is necessary to take it out ; in doing this, be careful not to tear the 
skin. A most excellent grill may be made by leaving sufficient meat 
for it upon the bones of a shoulder of mutton, when Siey are removed 
from the joint : it will be found very superior to the broiled blade-bone 
of a ro€ist shoulder, which is so much esteemed by many people.

herbs, miDced small ; season it well with salt, cayenne, and ponnded

from rind and rust Roll the veal, and bind it tightly with a iSllet ; 
roast it fer an hour and a half, then simmer it gently in sood brown 
gravy for five hours; add forcemeat balls before it is dished; skim the 
rat from the gravy, and serve it witli the meat. This receipt, for which 
we are indebted to a correspondent on whom we can depend, and which 
we have not, therefore, proved ourselves, is for a joint which weighs 
ten pounds before it is boned.' 

EOAST inSCK OF YSAL. 

The best end of the neck will make an excellent roast A forcemeat 
way be inserted between the skin and the fiesh, by first separating them 
with a sharp knife ; or the dish may be garnished with the forcemeat in 
balls. From an hour and three-quarters to a couple of hours will roast 
it Pour melted butter over it when it is dished, and serve it like other 
joints. Let it be floured when first laid to the fire, kept constantly 
Dasted, and always at a sufficient distance to prevent its bemg scorched. 

1| to 2 hours. 

For the forcemeat, see No. 1, Chapter VI. From 8 to 10 minutes 
will fry the balls. « 

KNUCKLE OF TEAL; (en Ragout) 

Cut in small thick slices the fiesh of a knuckle of veal, season it with 
a little fine salt and white pepper, flour it lightly, and fry it in butter to 
a pale brown, lay it into a very clean stewpan or saucepan, and just 
cover it with boiling water ; skim it clean, and add to it a faggot of 
thyme and parsley, the white part of a head of celery, a small quantity 
of cayenne, and a blade or two of mace. Stew it very softly firom an 
hour and three-quarters, to two hours and a half. Thicken and enrich 
the gravy if needful with rice-flour and mushroom catsup or Harvey's 
sauce, or with a large teaspoonful of flour, mixed with a slice of butter, 
a little good store-sauce and a glass of sherry or Madeira. Fried force- 
meat balls of No. 1, page 12^ may be added at pleasure. With an 
additional quantity of water, or of broth (made with the bones of the 
joint), a pint and a half of young green peas stewed with the veal fox 
an hour will give an agreeable variety of this dish. 

BOILED KNUCKLE OF TEAL. 

After the joint has been trimmed and well washed, put it into a ves- 
sel well adapted to it in size, for if it be very large, so much water will 
be required that the veal will be deprived of its flavour ; it should be 
well covered with it, and very gently boiled until it is perfectly tender 
in every part, but not so much done as to separate from the bone. Clear 
off the scum with scrupulous care when the simmering first commences, 
and throw in a small portion of salt ; as this, if sparingly used, will not 
redden the meat, and will otherwise much improve it Parsley and 
batter is usually both poured over, and sent to table with a knuckle of 
veal, and boiled bacon also should accompany it. From the sinewy 
nature of this joint, it requires more than the usual time of cooking, 9 
quarter of an hour to the pound not being suflicieut for it 

Yea^ 6 to 7 lbs.: 2 hours or more.

CniCKLS OV VBAL WITB KICK OB 0BECN FKAfl. 

Pour over a small knuckle of veal rather more than sufficient water 
to cover it ; bring it slowly to a boil ; take off all the scum with great 
care, throw in a teaspoonful of salt, and when the joint has simmered 
for about half an hour, throw in from eight to twelve ounces of well- 
washed rice, and stew the veal gently for an hour and a half longer, or 
until both the meat and rice are perfectly tender. A seasoning of cay- 
enne and mace in fine powder with more salt, should it be required, 
must be added twenty or thirty minutes berore they are served. For a 
superior stew, good veal broth may be substituted for the water. 

Veal, 6 lbs. ; water, 3 to 4 pints; salt, 1 teaspoonful : 30 to 40 min- 
utes. Rice, 8 to 12 ozs. : I4 hour. Seasoning of cayenne, mace, and 
more salt if needed. A quart or even more of fiill-grown green peas 
added to the veal as soon as the scum has been cleared ofiT will make a 
most excellent stew. It should be well seasoned with white pepper, 
and the mace should be omitted. Two or three cucumbers, pared and 
freed from the seeds, may be sliced into it when it boils, or four or five 
young lettuces shred small may be used to give it flavour. 

BORDTKX YEAXi CAKE; {gOOd,) 

Take a pound and a half of veal perfectly clear of fiit and Erkin, and 
eight ounces of the nicest striped bacon ; chop them separately, then 
mix them well together with the CTated rind of a small lemon, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, a fourth as much of cayenne, the third part of a nut- 
meg, grated, and a half'teaspoonful of freshly pounded mace. When it 
is pressed into the dish, let it be somewhat higher in the centre than at 
tiie edge ; and whether to be served hot or cold, lift it out as soon as it 
comes from the oven, and place it on a strainer that the fat may drain 
fiiom it : it will keep many days if the under side be dry. The bacon 
should be weighed after the rind, and any rust it may exhibit, have 
been trimmed from it : that cured by the East Farleigh receipt, (see 
Chapter XL) is best for the purpose. This cake is excellent cold, bet- 
ter indeed than the preceding one; but slices of either if preferred hot, 
may be warmed through in a Dutch oven, or on the gridiron, or in a 
few spoonsful of gravy. The same ingredients made into small cakes,^ 
well floured, and slowly fried from twelve to fifteen minutes, then served 
with gravy made in the pan as for cutlets, will be found extremely 
good. 

Veal, 1^ lb.; striped bacon, 6 ozs.; salt and mace, 1 teaspoonful 
each ; rind of lemon, 1 ; third of 1 nutmeg ; cayenne, 4 grains : baked 
1^ to 1^ hour. 

FRICANDEAIT OF VEAI^ (entree.) 

French cooks always prefer for this dish, which is a common one in 
their own country, that part of the fillet to which the fiU or udder is 
attached ;* but the flesh of the finer part of the neck, or loin, raised 
clear from t^ie bones, may be made to answer the purpose nearly, or 
quite as well, and often much more conveniently, as the meat with oft 
is not divided for sale as in France ; and to purchase the entire fillet, 
for the salie of the fricundeau, would render it exceedingly expensive. 
Xiay the veal flat upon a table, or dresser, with the skin uppermost, and 

-- I ■■■!■■■■ ■* I _ , ,, ,^^ 1^ _, 

* Called by them the nptx. 



CHAP. IX.J VBAL. 169 

endeavour, with one stroke of an exceedingly eiharp knife, to elear 
this of^ and to leave the surface of the meat extremely smooth ; next 
lard it thickly with small lardoons, as directed for a partridge (ptLjge 
140,) and make one or two incisions in the under side with the point 
of a knife, that it mar the better imbibe the flavour of the seasonines. 
Take a stewpan, of sufficient size to hold the fricandean, and uie 
proper quantity of vegetables compactly arranged, without much room 
bein^ left round the meat. Put into it a couple of large carrots, 
cut in thick slices, two onions of moderate size, two or three roots 
of parsley, three bay-leaves, two small blades of mace, a branch or 
two of lemon thjone, and a little cayenne, or a saltspoonful of white 
peppercorns. Raise these high in the centre of the stewpan, so as to 
support the meat, and prevent its touching the gravy. Cover them with 
slices of very fat bacon, and place the fricandeau gently on them ; then 
pour in as much good veal broth, or stock, as will nearly cover the vege- 
tables without reaching to the veal. A calf's foot, split in two, may 
with advantage be laid under them in the first instance. Stew the fn- 
candeau very gently for upwards of three hours, or until it is found to 
be extremely tender when probed with a fine skewer or a larding-pin. 
Plenty of live embers must then be put on the lid of the stewpan for 
ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, to render the lardoons firm. lAft 
out the fricandeau, and keep it hot; strain and reduce the gravy very 
quickly, afler having skimmed off every particle of fiit; glaze the veal, 
and serve it on a ragout of sorrel, cucumbers, or spinach. This, though 
rather an elaborate receipt, is the best we can ofler to the reader for a 
dish, which is now almost as fashionable with us as it is common on the 
Continent. Some English cooks have a very summary method of pre- 
paring it ; they merely lard and boil the veal until they can '* cut it 
with a spoon," then fflaze and serve it with " brown gravy in the dish.** 
This may be very tolerable eating, but it will bear small resemblance to 
Che French fricandeau. 
3| to 4 hours. 

SFRINO-SriEW OF VEAL. 

Cut two pounds of veal, free from fat, into small half^inch thick cut* 
lets; flour them well, and fry them in butter with two small cucumbers 
sliced, sprinkled with pepper, and floured, one moderate sized lettuce, 
and twenty-four green gooseberries cut open lengthwise and seeded. 
When the whole is nicely browned, lift it into a thick saucepan, and 
pour gradually into the pan half a pint, or rather more, of boiling water, 
orotJi, or gravy. Add as much salt and pepper as it requires. Give it 
a minute's simmer, and pour it over the meat, shaking it well round the 
pan as this is done. Let the veal stew gently from three quarters of 
an hour to an hour. A bunch of green onions cut small may be added 
to the other vegetables if liked; and the veal will eat better if slightly 
seasoned with ^t and pepper before it is floured ; a portion of &t can 
be left on it if preferred. 

Veal, 2 lbs. ; cucumbers, 2 ; lettuce, 1 ; green gooseberries, 24 ; water 
or broth, i pint or more : ^ to 1 hour.

taken from the neck, chop the bones very short, and trim away tb« 
greater part of the fat Arrange them as flat as they can be in a sauce- 
pan ; give a pint of hot water a boil in the pan in which they have been 
browned, and pour it on them; add a small faggot of parsley, and, 
should the flavour be liked, one of green onions also. Let the meat 
simmer softly for half an hour ; then cover it with small new potatoes 
which have had a single boil in water, give the saucepan a shake, and 
let the harrico stew very gently for ano^er half hoar, or until the pota- 
toe» are quite done, and the veal is tender. When the cutlets are thick 
and the potatoes approaching their full size, more time will be required 
for the meat, and the vegetables may be at once divided : if extremely 
young they will not need the previous boil. Before the harrico is 
served, skim the fat from it, and add salt aud pe}^r should it not be 
sufficiently seasoned. A few bits of lean bam, or shoulder of bacon 
browned with the veal, will much improve this dish, and for some tastes, 
a little acid will render it more agreeable. Very delicate pork chops 
may be dressed in the same way. 

Veal, 2 to 3 lbs.; water (or gravy), 1 pint; new potatoes, IJ to 2 
lbs. ; faggot, parsley and green onions : 1 hour or more. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 

Take them, if possible, free from bone, and after having trimmed 
them into proper shape, beat them with a paste roller until uie fibre of 
the meat is thoroughly broken ; flour them well to prevent the escape 
of the gravy, and fry them from twelve to fifteen minutes over a fire 
which is not sufficiently fierce to burn them before they are quite cooked 
through : they should be of a fine amber brown, and perfectly done. 
Lift them, into a hot dish, pour the &t from the pan, throw in a slice of 
fresh butter, and when it is melted, stir or dredge in a dessertspoonful 
of flour ; keep these shaken until they are well coloured, then poor 
gradually to them a cup of gravy or boiling water; add pepper, salt, a 
little lemon pickle or juice, give the whole a boil, and pour it over the 
cutlets : a few fbrcemeat-balTs, fried, and served with them, is usually 
a very acceptable addition to this dish, even when it is garnished or 
accompanied with rashers of ham or bacon. A morsel of glaze, or of 
the jelly of roast meat, should, when at hand, be added to the sauce, 
which a little mushroom powder would further improve: mushroom 
sauce, indeed, is considered by many epicures as indispensable with 
veal cutlets. We have recommended, in this one instance, that the 
meat should be thoroughly beaten, because we find that the veal is 
wonderfully improved by the process, which, however, we still depre- 
cate for other meat 

12 to 15 minutes. 

- TEAL cirrLETS, OR coLLOPS. (entree.) (A la Fran^ise.^ 

Cut the veal into small, thin, round coUops of equal size, arrange 
them evenly in a saute-pan, or in a small frying-pan, and sprinkle a 
little fine salt, white pepper, and grated nutmeg on them. Clarify, oi

% SCOTCH COLLOPS. (ENTREE.) 

Prepare the veal as for the preceding receipt, but dip the collope into 
beaten egg and seasoned bread-crumbs, and fry them directly in good 
butter, over a moderate fire, of a light golden brown ; drain them well 
in lifting them from the pan, and sauce them like the collops a la 
FrangaUe. 

TEAL CUTUSTS, A LA MODE DE LONDRES; OR, LONDON 

FASHION, (entree.) 

Raise the flesh entire from the upper side of Ihe best end of a neck 
of veal, free it from the skin, and from the greater portion of the fat, 
slice it equally into cutlets little more than a quarter of an inch thick, 
brush them with egg^ strew them with fine bread-crumbs, and fry them 
of a light brown. Toast, or fry apart as many small slices of bacon as 
there are cutlets, and let them be trimmed nearly to the same shape ; 
place them alternately on their edges round the inside of a hot dish (so 
as to form a sort of chain), and pour into the middle some rich gravy 
made in the pan, and very slightly flavoured with eschalot ; or substi- 
tute for this some good brown mushroom sauce. Savoury herbs, grated 
lemon-rind, nutmeg, or mace, salt, and white pepper, or cayenne, should 
be mixed with the bread-crumbs, in the proper proportions,. for cutlets 
of calTs head ; or they may be varied at pleasure. A cheek of bacon 
is best adapted to this dish. 

sweetbreads, (entree.) (Simply dressed,) 

In whatever way sweetbreads are dressed, they should first be well 
iKMiked in lukewarm water, then thrown into boiling water to blanch 
ihem, as it is called, and to render them firm. If lifted out after they 
have boiled from five to ten minutes, according to their size, and laid 
immediately into fresh spring water to cool, their colour will be the 
better preserved. They may then be gently stewed for three quarters 
of an hour in veal gravy, which, wiUi the usoal additions of cream, 
lemon, and egg-yolks, may be conv^ted into a fricassee sauce for them 
when they are done ; or they may be lifted from it, glazed^ and served 
with good Spanish gravy ; or, the glazing being omitted, they may be 
sauced with the simrp Maitre ^ Hotel sauce of page 99. They mav 
also be simply floured, and roasted in a Dutch oven, being often basted 
with butter, and frequently tamed. A full sized sweetbread, after 
having been Uanched, will require quite three quarters of an bour to 
dress it 

Kanched 5 to 10 minntes. Stewed | hour or more.

Boil the sweetbreads finr half an hour in water, or veal broth, and

brush them with yolks dteg^g, and dip them into very fine bread-crumbs, 
aeasoned with salt, cayeime, grated lemoa-rind, and mace; fiy them in

batter of a fine light brown, arrange them in a dish, placing them high 
in the centre, and pour under them a gravy made in the pan, thickened 
with mushroom powder, and flavoured with lemon-jdice ; or, in lieu of 
ihis, sauce them with some rich brown gravy, to which a glass of sherry 
or Madeira has been added. When it can be done conveniently, take 
as many slices of a cold boiled tongue as there are sweetbread cutlets ; 
pare the rind from them, trim them into good shape, and dress them 
with the sweetbreads, after they have been egged and seasoned in the 
same way ; place each cutlet upon a slice of tongud when they are 
dished. For variety, substitute croutons of fried bread, stamped out to 
the size of the cutlets, with a round or fluted paste or cake cutter. The 
crumb of a stale loaf, very evenly sliced, is best for the purpose. 

STEWED calf's feet; {cheap and good.) 

This is an excellent family dish, highly nutritious, and often very 
inexpensive, as the feet, during the summer, are usually sold at a low 
rate. Wash them with nicety, divide them at the joint, and split the 
claws; arrange. them closely in a thick stewpan or saucepan, and pour 
in as much cold water as will cover them about half an inch : three 
pints will be sufficient for a couple of large feet When broth or stock 
IS at hand it is good economy to substitute it for the water, as, by this 
means, a portion of strong and well-flavoured jellied gravy will be 
obtained for general use, the full quantity not being need^ as sauce fat 
the feet The whole preparation will be much improved by laying a 
thick slice of the lean of an unboiled ham, knuckle of bacon, hung 
beef, or the end of a dried tongue, at the bottom of the pan, before the 
other ingredients are added ; or, when none of these are at hand, by 
supplying the deficiency with a few bits of stewing-beef or veal :.the 
feet being of themselves insipid, will be much more palatable with one 
or the other of these additions. Throw in from half to three quarters 
of a teaspoonful of salt when they begm to boil, and, after the scum has 
been all cleared ofij add a few branches of parsley, a little celery, one 
small onion or more, stuck with half a dozen cloves, a carrot or two, a 
large blade of mace, and twenty corns of whole pepper ; stew them 
sofQy until the flesh will part entirely from the bones ; take it fh>m 
them ; strain part of the gravy, and skim ofT all the fat, flavour it with 
catsup, or any other store sauce, and thicken it, when it boils, with 
arrow-root, or flour and butter ; put in the flesh of the feet, and serve 
the dish as soon as the whole is verv hot A glass of wine, a little 
lemon-juice, and a few forcemeat-balls, will convert this into a very 
superior stew ; a handful of mushroom-buttons also simmered in it for 
half an hour before it is dished will vary it agreeably. 

Calf's feet (large), 2; water, 3 pints; salt, ^ to ^ teaspoonful ; onions, 
1 to 3; cloves, 6; peppercorns, 20; mace, large blade; little celery 
and parsley; carrots, 1 or 2: stewed softly, 2i to S^ hours. Mush- 
room catsup, 1 tablespoonful ; flour, or arrow-root, 1 large teaspoonful* 
butter, 1 to 2 ozs. Cfayenne, to taste.

CHAP. IX.2 TEAL. 178 

■onioiK, or cechalots, and braaches cf pareley, may be steeped witn it in 
tlie vinegar, when their flavour is relished ; but, in g^eneral, they would 
not, we think, be considered an improvement. Wash and wipe the 
liver very dry, slice it evenly, season it with pei^r, salt, and savoury 
herbs shred extremely small, then flour and fry it in butter quickly of 
a fine light brown ; lift it out and keep it very hot, while a gravy is 
made for it in the pan. Pour out the fat, throw in a small slice of fresh

zoning of pepper and salt; about a quarter-pint of boiling water, and a 
little lemon-juice. Chili vinegar, or lemon'^ickle ; shake the pan well 
round, ^ive the whole a boil ; sauce the liver with it, and send it to 
table with or without a garni^ of curled bacon. 

TO BOAST CALF^S LIVER. 

Take the whole or part of a fine white sound liver, and either lard it 
as a fricandeau upon the surface, or with large stripe of highly-seasoned 
bacon in the inside (see Larding, page 139) ; or should either of these 
modes be objected to, merely wrap it in a well-battered paper, and 
roast it from an hour to an hour and a quarter, at a moderate distance 
from a clear fire, keeping it constantly basted. Remove the paper, and 
froth the liver well from ten to fifteen minutes before it is done. It 
should be served with a sauce of some piquancy, such as a poivrade, or 
brown eschalot, in addition to some good ^vy. French cooks steep 
the liver over-night in vinegar, with a sliced onion and branches of 
savoury herbs laid over it ; this whitens and renders it firm. As an 
economical mode, some small bits of the liver may be trimmed o$ 
floured, and lightly fried with a sliced onion, and stewed down for 
gravy in three quarters of a pint of water which has been poured into 
Uie pan, with the addition of a few peppercorns, and a small bunch of 
herbs. A seasoning of salt must not be forgotten, and a little lemon- 
pickle, or juice, would generally be consider^ an improvement 

1 to 1} hour. 

BLANQUBTTS OF TXAL OB LAMB, WITH MUSHROOMS. (ENTREE.) 

Slice very thin die white part of some cold veal, divide and trim it 
into scajlc^ not larger than a shilling, and lay it into a clean saucepan 
or stewpan. Wipe with a bit of new flannel and a few grains of salt, 
&oai a quarter to half a pint of mushroom-buttons, and slice them into 
a little butter which just hegina to simmer; stew them to it from 
twelve to fifteen minutes, without allowing them to take the slightest 
ocdour; then lift them out and lay them on the veal. Pour boiling to 
them a pint of sauce toiimee (see page 93); let the blanquette remain 
near but not close to the fire for awhile ; bring it nearer, heat it slowly, 
and when it is on the point of boiling^ mix a spoonful or two of the 
sauce from it with the well-beaten yolks of four fresh eggs; stir them 
to the remainder ; add the strained juice of half a small lemon ; shake 
the saucepan above the fire until the sauce is just set, and serve the 
blanquette instantly.

rooms are not indispenaable for it, but they are always a great improve- 
ment. White sauce substituted for the thickened veal gravy will at 
once convert this dish into an inexpensive fricassee. Mace, salt, and 
cayenne, must be added to either preparation, should it require sea^ 
ioning. 

mNOSD VsAIk 

When there is neither gravy nor broth at band, the bcnes and trim- 
mings of the meat must oe boiled down to furnish what is required for 
the mince. As cold meat is very light in weight, a pound of the white 
part of the veal will be sufficient for a dish, and for this quantity a pint 
of gravy will be needed. Break down the bones of the joint well, add 
the trimmings of the meat, a small bunch of savoury herbs, a slice or 
two of carrot or of celery, a blade of mace, a few white peppercorns, 
and a bit or two of lean ham, boiled, or unboiled if it can be had, as 
either will improve the flavour of the mince. Pour to these a pint and 
a half of water, and stew them gently for a couple of hours; then strain 
off the gravy, let it cool and clear it entirely from the fat Cut the 
white part of the veal small with a very sharp knife, after all the 
gristle and brown edges have been trimmed away. Some persons like 
a portion of fiit minced with it, others object to the addition altogether. ^ 
Thicken the gravy with a teaspoooful and a half of flour smoothly mix^ ' 
with a small slice of butter, season the veal with a saltspoonflil or more 
of salt, and half as much white pepper and grated nutmeg, or pounded 
mace; add the lightly-grated rind of half a small lemon; mix the wuole 
well, put it into the gravy, and heat it thoroughly by the side of the 
fire without allowing it to boil ; serve it with pale*toasted sippets in 
and round the dish. A spoonful or two of cream is always an improve- 
ment to this mince. \ 

MINOED VEAL AND OTSTER& 

The most elegunt mode of preparing this dish is to mince about a 
pound of the whitest part of the inside of a cold roast fillet or loin of 
veal, to heat it without allowing it to boil, in a pint of rich white sauce, 
or b^hamel, and to mix with it at the moment of serving three dozens 
of small oysters ready bearded, and plumped in their own strained 
liquor, which is also to be added to the mince ; the requisite quantity 
of^salt, cayenne, and mace should be sprinkled over the veal before it is 
put into the sauce. Garnish the dish with pale fried sippets of bread, 
or with fleurons* of brioche, or of puff-paste. Nearly half a pint of 
mushrooms minced, and stewed white in a little butter, may be mixed 
with the veal instead of the oysters ; or should they be very small they 
may be added to it whole : from ten to twelve minutes will be sufficient 
to make them tender. Balls of delicately firied oyster-forcemeat laid 
round the dish will give another good variety of it

FRICAfiSBED YEAU 

Divide into small, thick, handsome slices of equal size, about a couple 
of pounds of veal, quite free from fat, bone, and skin ; dissolve a couple 
of ounces of butter in a wide stewpan, and just as it begins to boil lay 
in the veal, and shake it over the fire until it is quite firm on both sides ; 
but do not allow it to take the slightest colour. Stir in a tablespoonfiil 
of flour, and when it is well mixed with the cutlets, pour gradually to 
them, shaking the pan often, sufficient boiling veal gravy to almost 
cover them. Stew them gently from fifty to sixty minutes, or longer 
should they not be perfectly tender. Add a flavouring of mace, some 
salt, a quarter-pint of rich cream, a couple of egg-yolks, and a little 
lemon-juice, observing, when the last are added, Uie directions given 
far a blanquette of veal, page 173. Strips of lemon-rind can be stewed 
in the gravy at pleasure. Two or three dozens of mushroom-buttons, 
added twenty mmutes before it is served, will much improve this 
fricassee.

white snd clear: when this is yellow, the meat ifl rank, and of bad 
quality. Mutton is not considered by experienced jud^s to be in per- 
fection until it is nearly or quite five years old ; but to avoid the addi- 
tional expense of feeding the animal so long, it is commonly brought 
into the market at three years old. The leg and the loin are the supe- 
rior joints ; and the preference would probably be given more frequently 
to the latter, but for the superabundance of its fet, which renders it a 
not very economical dish. The haunch consists of the leg and the part 
of the loin adjoining it ; the saddle, of the two loins together, or of the 
undivided hack of Uie sheep: these last are always roasted, and are 
served usually at good tables, or for company-^linners, instead of the 
smaller joints. The dioulder, dressed in the ordinary way, is ijot vei^ 
highly esteemed, but when boned, rolled, and filled with forcemeat, it 
is of more presentable appearance, and to many tastes, far better eating; 
though some peraons prefer it in its natural form, accompanied by stewed 
onions. It is occasionally boiled or stewed, and covered with rich onion 
sauce. The neck is sometimes roasted, but it is more generally boiled ; 
the scrag, or that part of it which joins the head, is seldom used for any 
other purpose than making broth, and should be taken off before the 
joint is dressed. Cutlets from the thick end of the loin are commonly 
preferred to any others, but tbey are frequently taken likewise from the 
best end of the neck (sometimes called the l>ack^ribs) and from the mid- 
dle of the leg. Mutton kidneys are dressed in various ways, and are 
excellent in many. The trotters and the head of a sheep may be con- 
verted into very good dishes, but they are scarcely wotih the trouUe 
which is required to render them palatable. The loin and the leg are 
occasionally cured and smoked like hams or bacon. 

TO ROAST A HAUNCH OF MUTTON. 

This joint should be well kept, and when the larder-accommodations 
of a house are not good, the butcher should be requested to bang it the 
the proper time. Roast it carefully at a large sound fire, and let it 
remain at a considerable distance for at least a couple of hours ; then 
draw it nearer, but never sufficiently so to burn or injure the fat Keep 
It constantly basted ; flour it soon after it is laid to the fire, instead of 
frothing it, as this latter mode is not generally relished, though fiishion 
is in its favour. In from three and a half to four jiours, the haunch will 
be done, and it will require something less of time when not kept back 
at first, as we have advised ; but if roasted entirely on the plan men- 
tioned at page 132, it will be much finer than in the usual way. Serve 
it with a good Espagnole, or with plain mutton-gravy and currant-jelly. 
This joint, when the meat is of very fine quality, may be dressed and 
served exactly like venison. 

3^ to 4 hours. 5 hours or more by the slow method. 

ROAST SADDLE OF MIITTOlf. 

7his is an excellent joint, though not considered a very economical 
one. It is usual for the butcher to raise the skin from it before it is 
sent in, and to skewer it on again, that in the roasting the juices of the 
meat may he better preserved, and the fat prevent^ from taking too 
lAuch colour, as this should be only slightly browned. In something 
leas than half an hour before the mutton is done, remove the skui, aM 



CHAP. X.] KCTTON. 177 

floor the joint lightly after having basted it well Our own great objeo* 
tion to frothed meat would lead us to recommend that the skin should 
be taken off half an hour earlier, and that the joint should be kept at 
sufficient distance from the fire to prevent the possibility of the fat being 
burned; and that something more of time should be allowed for the 
roasting. With constant Insting, great care, and good management, 
the cook may always ensure the proper appearance of this, or of any 
other joint (except, perhaps, of a haunch of venison) without having 
recourse to papering or pasting, or even to replacing the skin ; but when 
unremitted attention cannot be given to this one part of the dinner, it 
is advisable to take all precautions that can secure it from being spoiled. 
2^ to 2| hours. More if very large. 

TO ROAST A LEO OF MUTTON. 

In a cool and airy larder, a leg of mutton will hang many days with 
advantage, if the kernel be taken out, and the flap wii^ very dry when 
it is first brought in ; and it is never tender when freshly killed : in warm 
weather it should be well dredged with pepper to preserve it fi'om the 
flies. If washed before it is put upon the spit, it should be wiped as dry 
as possible afterwards, and well floured soon after it is laid to the fire. 
When the excellence of the joint is more regarded than the expense of 
fuel, it should be roasted by what we have denominated the slow 
method; that is to say, it should be kept at a considerable distance 
from the fire, and remain at it four hours instead of two: it may be 
drawn nearer for the last twenty or thirty minutes, to ^ive it colour. 
The gravy will flow from it in great abundance when it is cut, and the 
meat will be very superior to that roasted in the usual way. When 
this plan is not pursued, the mutton should* still be kept quite a foot 
from the fire until it is heated through, and never brought sufficiently 
near to scorch or to harden any part It should be constantly basted 
with its own fat, for if this be neglected, all other precautions will fiiil 
to ensure a good roast ; and after it is dished, a little fine salt should be 
sprinkled lightly on it, and a spoonful or two of boiling water ladled 
over. This is the most palatable mode of serving it, but it may be 
frothed when it is preferred so, though we would rather recommend that 
the flour should be dredged on in the first instance, as it then prevents 
the juices of the meat from escaping, and forms a savoury coating to it; 
while the raw taste Vhich it so often retains with mere frothing is to 
many eaters especially objectionable. 

Leg of mutton, 7 to 8 lbs. ; slow method 4 hours, common method 1} 
to 2 hours. 

SUPERIOR RECEIPT FOR ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

Cover the joint well with cold water, bring it gradually to boil, and 
let it simmer gently for half an hour ; then liu it out, put it immediately 
on to the spit, and roast it from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a 
half^ according to its weight. This mode of dressing the joint renders 
it remarkably juicy and tender ; but there must be no delay in putting 
it on the spit after it is lifted from the water ; it may be garnished with 
roast tomatas. 

Boiled, i hour ; roast, 1 J to 1 J hour.

cot throagh the middle of the skin from the kniicUe to the first joint, 
aod mise it from the flesh on the side along which the bone runs, until 
the knife is just above it, then cut through the flesh down to the bone ; 
work the knife round it in every part till you reach the socket ; next 
remove the flat bone from the large end of the joint, and pass the knife 
freely round the remaining one, as it is not needful to take it out clear 
of the meat; when you again reach the middle joint, loosen the skin 
round it with great care, and the two bones can then be drawn out 
without being divided. This being done, fill the cavities with the force- 
meat, Na 1. (page 122), adding to it a somewhat high seasoning of 
eschalot, garlic, or onion ; or cut out with the bone, nearly a pouid of 
the inside of the mutton, chop it fine with six ounces of delicate striped 
bacon, and mix with ^t thoroughly three-quarters of an ounce of pars- 
ley, and half as much of thyme and winter saVoiYf all minced extremely 
small ; a half teaspoonful of pepper (or a third as much of cayenne) ; 
the same of mace, salt, and nutmeg, and either the grated rind of a 
small lemon, or four eschalots finelv shred. When the lower part of 
the leg is filled, sew the skin neatly together where it has been cut 
open, and tie the knuckle round tightly, to prevent the escape of the 
gravy. Replace the flat bone at the large end, and with a long needle 
and twine, draw the edges of the meat together over it If it can be 
done conveniently, it is better to roast the mutton thus prepared an a 
cradle spit or upon a hanging or bottle-jack, with the knuckle dowx>- 
wards. Place it at first far from the fire, and keep it constantly basted. 
It will require nearly or quite three hours roasting. Remove the twine 
before it is served, and send it very hot to table with some rich brown 
gravv ; or it may be put into a braising-pan and stewed gently fi>ur or 
nve hours. 

MOCK VENISON. 

Hang a plump and finely-grained leg of mutton in a cool place, for 
as many days as it can possibly be kept without becoming altogether 
uneatable. Lay it on a dish, pour over, and rub well into i^ about half 
a small cupful of pyroligneous acid, and let it remain ten minutes. 
Wash it very thoroughly, cut ofiT the knuckle, and trim away the flap, 
and any part that may continue very ofl^nsive, or take a few inches 
from either end of the joint ; then lay it into a close-shutting stewpot, 
or thick iron saucepan of its own size, with no other liquid than the 
drops of water which adhere to it, and simmer it over a very slow fire, 
&om four and a half to five hours, turning it several times, that it may 
be equally done. Give it no seasoning beyond pepper and salt Should 
the gravy be too much reduced, add two spoonsml of boiling water, or 
of mutton gravy. Send the meat to table in its own juices, with cur- 
rant jelly, or sharp venison sauce apart We owe this receipt entirely 
to accident ; for, wishing to have proof of the anti* putrescent qualities 
of the pyroligneous acid, we had it applied to a leg of mutton which 
had been kept too long, and which was dressed in the way we have 
described. When brought to table, its resemblance to venison, both in 
appearance and flavour, was remarkable ; and several persons partook 
of it hashed on the following day, and were all perfectly unconscious 
that they were not really eating venison ; in the latter instance, it was 
served in rich gravy made in part of hare ; a glaas of port wine, a little 
compound catBop» and a thickening of rice flour were added. The 



CHAP. X.] ]fUTTOir« 171 

meat, of course, was only heated through, and not allowed to boH. On 
a second trial we found it an improvement to touch the mutton in every 

Eart with a feather dipped in the acid, as soon as it gave evidence of 
aving been sufficiently kept, and then to let it hang, three or four dayi 
longer : it was again washed with the acid, and ailerwards with cold 
water before it was dressed. 

TO SOIL A LEO OF mftton; (an excellent receipt.) 

Trim into handsome form a well-kept, but perfectly sweet leg of 
mutton, of middling weight ; wash, but do not soak it ; lay it into a 
vessel as nearly of its size as convenient, and pour in rather more than 
sufficient cold waj^r to cover it ; set it over a good fire, and when it 
begins to boil, take off the scum, and continue to do so until no more 
appears ; throw in a tablespoonful of salt (aflei#he first skimming), 
which will assist to bring it to the surface, and as soon as the liquor is 
clear, add two moderate-sized onions, stuck with a dozen cloves, a large 
&ggot of parsley, thyme, and savory, and four or five large carrots, 
and half an hour afterwards, as many turnips. Draw the pan to the 
side of the fire, and let the mutton be simmered gently for two hours 
and a half! from the time of its first beginning to boil. Serve it with 
caper, brown cucumber, or oyster sauce. If stewed softly, as we have 
directed, tlie mutton will be found excellent dressed thus ; otherwise, it 
will but resemble the unpalatable and ragged-looking joints of ftist^ 
boiled meat, so constantly sent to table by common £nglish cooks. 
Any undressed bones of veal, mutton, or beef, boiled with the joint, 
will improve it much, and the liauor will then make excellent soup or 
bouillon. 

2 to 2^ hours. 

COLD ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

When only a few slices have been cut from the middle of the ioint, 
it will still affi)rd a fillet of tolerable size, which, dressed in the follow- 
ing manner, will make a dish of better appearance and savour than a 
common hash or mince. Take off as much of the large end of the leg, 
quite through, as will render that side of the fillet perfectly flat ; cut 
also evenly through the joint, where it has been carved ; then remove 
the bone from the fillet, and replace it with veal forcemeat (No. 1, page 
122) ; put the meat, with the bones, knuckle, and trimmings, into a 
stewpot, or stout saucepan adapted to its size, and just cover it with 
water, or with broth in preference, when any .stock is at hand ; as soon 
as it boils, add a couple of onions, a bunch of parsley, two or even three 
hay-leaves, four or five carrots, and as many turnips {phnty of vege- 
tubleti in fiict), and simmer the whole gently for nearly, or quite a 
couple of hours. Thickening, spice, or store-sauce, can be added to the 
gravy at will, before the meat is served, which it should be with the 
vegetables round it . 

A FILLET OF MUTTON. 

Cut some inches from either end of a large and well-kept leg of 
mutton, and leave the fillet shaped like one of veal. Remove the bone, 
and fill the cavity with forcemeat (No. 1, page 122), which may be 
flavoured with a little minced onion, when its flavour is liked : more 
forcemeat ma^ be added by detaching the skin sufficiently on the flap 
side to admit it When thus prepared, the fillet may be floured, and

loaste^ served with currant-jelly and brown gravy, or with only melted 
batter poured over it ; or it may be stewed gently for nearly or quite 
four hours, in a pint of gravy or water, after having been floured and 
browned all ov^r in a couple of ounces of butter ; it must then be turned 
every hour, tiiat it mav be equally done. Two or three small onions, a 
fii^got of herbs, a couple of carrots sliced, four or five cloves, and twenty 
whole peppercorns can be added at wilL 
Roasted 2 hours, or stewed 4 hours. 

TO ROA8T A LOIN OF MUTTON. 

The flesh of the loin of mut&n is superior to that of the leg, when 
roasted; but to the frugal housekeeper this conshferation is usually 
overbalanced by the great weight of fat attached to it ; this, however, 
when economy is m#B considered than appearance, may be pared off 
and melted down for various kitchen uses, or finely chopped, and sub- 
stituted for suet in making hot pie or pudding crust When thus re- 
duced in size, the mutton will be soon roasted. If it is to be dressed in 
the usual way, the butcher should be desired to take off the skin ; care 
should be taken to preserve the fat from being ever so slightly burned ; 
it should be managed, indeed, in the same manner as the saddle, in 
every respect, and carved also in the same way, that is to say, the meat 
should be cut out in slices the whole length of the back-bone, and close 
to it 

Without the fat, 1 to 1} hour; with, 1^ to 1} hour. 

TO DRESS A LOIN OF MITITON LIKE VENISON. 

Skin and bone a loin of mutton, and lay it into a stewpan, or braisinfin. 
pan, with a pint of water, a lar?e onion stuck with a dozen cloves, half 
a pint of port wine and a spoonml of vinegar ; add, when it boils, a small 
faggot of tliyme and parsley, and some pepper and salt: let it stew 
three hours, and turn it often. Make some gravy of the bones, and add 
it at intervals to the mutton when required. 

This receipt comes to us so strongly recommended by persons who 
have partaken frequently of the dish, that we have not thought it need- 
ful to prove it ourselves. 

3 hours. 

TO ROAST A SHOULDER OF MUTTON. 

Flour it well, and baste it constantly with its own dripping; do not 
place it close enough to the fire for the &t to be in the slightest degree 
burned, or even too deeply browned. An hour and a half will roast it* 
if it be of moderate size. Stewed onions are often sent to table with it 
A shoulder of mutton is sometimes boiled, and smothered with anion 
sauce.

the mutton turned, and rubbed occasionally with the pickle from eight 
to ten days ; then roll it up tight, bind it with a fillet, and stew it genUy

These may be taken from the loin, or the best end of the neck, but 
the former are generally preferred. Trim off a portion of the fat, or the 
whole of it, ilnless it be liked; pepper the cutlets, heat the gridiron, rub 
it with a bit of the mutton suet, broil thern over a brisk fire, and turn 
them often until they are done ; tbis^ for the generality of eaters, will be

which they should not be. French cooks season them with pepper and 
salt, and five them a light coating of dissolved butter or of oil, before 
they are laid to the fire, and we have found the cutlets so managed 
extremely good. 

Lightly broiled, 7 to 8 minutes. Well done, 10 minutes.

when they are dished ; or they may be served quite dry, or with brown 
gravy ; or when none is at hand, with good melted butter seasoned with 
mushroom catsup, cayenne, and Chili vinegar, or lemon-juice. 

CHINA CHILO. 

Mince a pound of an undressed loin or leg of mutton, with or without 
a portion of its fat, mix with it two or three young lettuces shred sniall, 
a pint of young peas, a teaspoonful of salt, half as much pepper, four 
tablespoonsful of water, from two to three ounces of good butter, and, 
if the flavour be liked, a few green onions minced. Keep the whole 
well stirred with a fork, over a clear and gentle fire until it is quite hot, 
then place it closely covered by the side of the stove, or on a high trevet, 
that It may stew as softly as possible for a couple of hours. One or 
even two half^grown cucumbers, cut small by scoring the ends deeply 
as they are sliced, or a quarter-pint of minced mushrooms may be adaed 
with good effect; or a dessertspoonful of currie-powder and a large 
chopped onion. A dish of boiled rice should be sent to table with it 

Ikfutton, 1 pint; green peas, 1 pint; young lettuces, 2; salt, 1 tea- 
spoonful ; pepper, i teaspoonful ; water, 4 tablespoonsful ; butter, 2 to 3 
ozs. : 2 hours. Varieties : cucumbers, 2 ; or mushrooms minced, ^ pint ; 
or currie-powder, 1 dessertspoonful, and 1 large onion. 

A GOOD FAMILT eTTEW OF MFTTON. 

Put into a broad stewpan or saucepan a flat layer of mutton chops, 
freed entirely from fat and from the greater portion of the bone, then 
just dipped mto cold water, seasoned with pepper, and lightly dredged 
with flour; on these put a layer of mild turnips sliced half an inch 
thick, and divided into squares ; then some carrots of the same thick- 
ness, with a seasoning of salt and black pepper between Uiem ; next, 
another layer of chops, then plenty of vegetables, and as much weak 
broth or cold water as will barely cover the whole ; bring them slowly 
to a boil, and let them just simmer from two to three hours, according 
to the quantity. One or two minced onions may be strewed between 
the other vegetables when their flavour is liked. The savour of the 
dish will be mcreased by browning the chops in a little butter before 
they are stewed, and still more so by frying the vegetables lightly as 
well, before they are added to it A head or two of celery would to 
many tastes improve the flavour of the whole. In summer, cucumber, 
green onions, shred lettuces, and green peas may be substituted for the 
winter vegetables. 

Mutton, free from fat, 2$ lbs. ; turnips, 3 lbs. ; carrots, 3 lbs. ; celery 
(if added), 2 small heads : 2 to 3 hours. 

Ohs, — ^The ftit and trimmings of the mutton used for this and for 
other dishes into which only the lean is admissible may be turned to 
advantage by cutting the whole up rather small, and then boiling it in

a quart of water to the pound, with a little spice, a bunch of herbs and 
some salt, uatil the fat is nearly dissolved: the liquid will then, if 
strained off and left until cold, make tolerable broth, and the cake of 
fat which is on the top, if again just melted and poured free of sediment 
into email pans, will serve excellently for common pies and for frying 
kitchen dinners. Less water will of course produce broth of better 
qimlity, and the addition of a small quantity of fresh meat or bones will 
render it very good. 

411 IRISH STEW. 

Take a couple of pounds of small thick mutton cutlets with or with- 
out fat according to the taste of the persons to whom the stew is to be 
served ; take also four pounds of good potatoes^ weighed after they are 
pared, slice them thick, and put a portion of them, in a flat layer, into 
a large thick saucepan or stewpan ; season the' mutton well with pejv* 
per, and place some of it on the potatoes,* cover it with another layer, 
and proceed in the same manner with all, reserving plenty of the vege- 
table for the top ; pour in three quarters of a pint of cold water, and 
add, when tlie stew begins to boil, an ounce of salt ; let it simmer 
gently for two hours, and serve it very hot When the addition of 
onion is liked, strew in two or three minced ones with the potatoes. 

Mutton cutlets, 2 lbs. ; potatoes, 4 lbs. ; pepper, i oz. ; salt, 1 oz. ; 
water, j pint: 2 hours. 

Ohs. — ^For a real Irish stew the potatoes should be boiled to a mash : 
an additional quarter-hour may be necessary for the full quantity here, 
but for half of it two hours are quite sufficient. 

OVJIiETB OF COLD MUTTON. 

Trim into well-shaped cutlets, which should not be very thin, the re- 
mains of a roast loin or neck of mutton, or of a quite under-dressed 
stewed or boiled joint; dip them into egg and well-seasoned bread- 
crumbs, and broil or fry them over a quick fire that they may be browned 
and heated through without beinff too much done. This is a very good 
mode of serving a half^roasted loin or neck. When the cutlets are 
broiled they should be dipped into, or sprinkled thickly with butter just 
dissolved, or they will be exceedingly dry ; a fow additional crumbs 
should be made to adhere to them after they are moistened with this. 

MUTTON KIDNEYS A LA FBAN^AISE. (ENTBEE.) 

Skin six or eight fine fresh mutton kidneys, and, without opening 
them, remove the fiit ; slice them rather thin, strew over them a large 
dessertspoonful of minced herbs, of which two-thirds should be parsley 
and the remainder thyme, with a tolerable seasoning of pepper or cay- 
enne, and some fine salt. Melt two ounces of butter in a fryingHMin, 
put in the kidneys and brown them quickly on both sides ; when nearly 
done, stir amongst them a dessertspoonful of flour, and shake them well 
in the pan ; pour in the third of a pint of gravy (or of hot water in 
default of this), the juice of half a lemon, and as much of Harvey's 
sauce, or of mushroom catsup, as will flavour the whole pleasantly ; 
bring these to the point of boiling, and pour them into a dish garnished 
with fried sippets, or lift out the kidneys first, give the sauce a boil and 
pour it on them. We generally have the store-sauce of page 147 (see 
English stew) used to flavour this dish in preference to simple catsup. 



184 MODEBN COOKERY. [OHtf . X. 

In France, a couple of glasses of champagne, or, for variety, of claret, 
are frequently added to the gravy; one or port wine can be substituted 
for either of these. A deasertBpoonful of minced eschalots may be 
strewed over the kidneys with the herbs; or two dozens of very small 
ones, previously stewed till tender in firesh butter over a gentle fire, 
may be added after they are dialled. Tliis is a very excellent and 
approved receipt 
Fried 6 minutes. 

BROILBD MVTTOir SIDNEYS. 

Split them open lengthwise without dividing them ; strip off the skin 
and fat ; run a fine skewer through the points and across the back of 
the kidneys to keep them flat while broiling ; season them with pepper 
or cayenne ; lay them over a clear brisk fire, with the cut sides towards 
it; turn them in from fbur to five minutes; and in as many more dish, 
and serve them quickly, with or without a cold M&itre d Hotel sauce 
under them. French cooks season them with pepper and fine salt, and 
brush a very small quantity of oil, or clarified butter over them before 
they are broiled : we think this an improvement 

8 to 10 minutes.

Fry gently, in a little good butter, a dozen crotitons (slices of bread, 
of uniform shape and size, trimmed free from crust,) cut half an inch 
thick, about two inches and a half wide, and from three to fbur in length : 
lift them out and keep them hot. Split quite asunder six fine firesh kid- 
neys, after having freed them from the skin and fat ; season them with 
fine salt and cayenne ; arrange them evenly in a clean fryiug-pan, and 
pour some clarified butter over them. Fry them over a somewhat brisk 
fire ; dish each half upon a crouton ; make a sauce in the pan as fir 
veal cutlets, but use gravy for it instead of wat^, should it be at hand ; 
. add a little wine or catsup ; pour it round the croiitons, and serve the 
kidneys instantly.

TO ROAST A FORE QUARTER OF IAMB. 

This should be laid to a clear brisk fire, and carefully and plentifully 
basted from the time of its becoming warm until it is ready for table ; 
but though it requires quick roasting, it must never be placed sufficiently 
near the fire to endanger the fat, which is verv liable to catck or burn. 
When the joint is served, the shoulder should be separated from the 
ribs with a sharp knife, and a small slice of fresh butter, a little cay- 
enne, and a squeeze of lemon-juice should be laid between them ; if the 
cook be an expert carver, this had better be done before the lamb is 
sent to table. The cold Maftre d*Hotel sauce of page 100, may be sub- 
stituted for the usual ingredients, the parsley being omitted or not, 
according to the taste. Serve good mint sauce, and a fresh salad with 
this roast 

A leg, sbouldet. or loin of lamb should be cooked by the same direc- 
tions as the quarter, a difiTerence only being made in the time allowed 
finr each.

SADDLE OF LAMB. 

This is an exceedingly nice joint for a small party. It should be 
roasted at a brisk fire, and kept constantly basted with its own dripping : 
it will require from an hour and three quarters to two hours roasting. 
Send it to table with mint sauce, and if convenient, with brown cucum-

until the sugar is dissolved. 

ROAST LOIN OF LAMB. 

Place it at a moderate distance from a clear fire, baste it frequently, 
froth it when nearly done, and serve it with the same sauces as the pre- 
ceding joints. A loin of lamb may be boiled and sent to table with 
white cucumber, mushroom, common white sauce, or parsley and butter. 

1 to 1^ hour. 

STEWED LEG OF LAMB WITH WHITE SAUCE. (ENTREE.) 

Choose a small plump leg of lamb, not much exceeding five pounds 
in weighty put it into a vessel nearly of its size, withji few trimmings, 
or a bone or two of undressed veal if at hand ; cover it with cold water, 
bring it slowly to a boil, clear off the scum with great care when it is 
first thrown to the surface, and when it has all been skimmed oS^ add a 
bunch of thyme and parsley, and two carrots of moderate size. Let the 
lamb simmer only, but without ceasing, for an hovtr and a quarter ; 
serve it covered with bechamel, or rich English white sauce, and send 
a boil^ tongue to table with it, and some of the sauce in a tureen. 

1^ hour. 

LOIN OF LAMB STEWED IN BUTTER. (eNTREE.) 

Wash the joint, and wipe it very dry ; skewer down the flap, and lay 
it into a close-shutting and thick stewpan, or saucepan, in which three 
ounces of good butter have been just dissolved, but not allowed to boil ; 
let it simmer slowly over a very gentle fire for two hours and a quarter, 
and turn it when it is rather more than half done. Liil it out, skim 
and pour the gravy over it; send brown asparagus, cucumber, or sou« 
bise sauce to table with it ; or brown gravy, mint sauce, and a salad.

8E PORK. 



This meat is so proverbially, and we believe even dangerouBly on- 
wholesome when ill fed, or in any degree diseased, that its quality 
should be closely examined before it is purchased. When not home* 
fatted, it should be bought if possible of some respectable farmer, or 
miller, unless the butcher who supplies it can be perfectly relied on. 
Both the fat and lean should be very white, and the latter finely grained; 
the rind should be thin, smooth, and cool to the touch; if it be clammy, 
the pork is stale, and should l)e at once rejected ; it ought also to be 
scrupulously avoided when the fat, instead of being quite clear of all 
blemish, is full of small kernels, which are indicative of disease. The 
manner of cutting up the pork varies in difierent counties, and also 
according to the purposes for which it is intended. The legs are either 
made into hams, or slightly salted for a few davs and boiled ; they aro 
also sometimes roasted when the pork is not large nor coarse, with a 



CHAP. ZI.3 VOtLti. 18T 

fiavoury forcemeat inserted between the skin and flesh of the knuckle. 
The part of the shoulder called the hand is also occasionally pickled in 
the same way as hams and bacon, or it may be salted and boiled, but it 
is too sinewy for roastingf. After these and the head have been taken 
off, the remainder, without further division than being split down the 
back, ma^ be converted into whole side», or flitches, as they are usually 
called, of bacon ; but when the meat is large, and required in part for 
various other purposes, a chine may be taken out, and the fat pared off 
the bones of the ribs and loins for bacon ; the thin part of the body con- 
verted into pickled pork, and the ribs and other bones roasted, or made 
into pies or sausages. The feet, which are generally salted down for 
immediate use, are excellent if laid for two or Uiree weeks into the same 
pickle as the hams, then well covered with cold water, and slowly boiled 
until tender. 

The loins of young and delicate p(»'k are roasted with \h» skin <m ; 
and this is scored in regular stripes of about a quarter-inch wide with 
the point of a sharp knife, before the joints are laid to the fire. Tho 
skin of the leg also is just cut through in the same manner. This is 
done to prevent its blistering, kq^ to reader it more easy to carve, aa 
the skin (or cruclding') becomes so crisp and hard in the cooking, that 
it is otherwise sometimes difficult to divide it 

To be at any time fit for table, pork must be perfedhf sweet, and 
thoroughly cooked ; great attention also should be given to it when it ia 
in picUe, for if any part of it be long exposed to the aur, without being 
turned into, or well and frequently basted with the brine, it will often 
become tainted during the process of curing it 

TO HEI/r LABD. 

Strip the skin ftom the inside fat of a freshly killed and well-fed 
pi^ ; slice it small and thin ; put it into a new or well-scalded jar, set 
it mto a pan of boiling water, and let it simmer oVer a clear fire. As 
it dissolves, strain it into small stone jars, or deep earthen pans, and 
when perfectly cold, tie over it the skin that was cleared from the krd« 
or bladders which have been thoroughly wa^ed and wiped very drv. 
Lard thus prepared is extremely pure in flavour, and keeps perfectly 
well, if stored in a cool place ; it may be used with advantage in mak- 
infif pastry, as well as for frying fish, and for various other purposes. It 
is better to keep the last drainmgs of the fat apart from that which is 
first poured off, as it will not be quite so fine in quality. 

TO PRESERVE 17NMELTED LARD FOR HANT MONTBS. 

For the particular uses' to which the leaf-fat, or fleed, can be advan- 
tageously applied, see fleed-crust, Chapter XVI. It may be kept well 
during the summer months by rubbing fine salt rather plentifully upon 
it when it is first taken fh)m the pig, and leaving it for a couple of days; 
it should then be well drained, and covered with a strong brine : this, 
in warmer weather, should be changed occasionally. When wanted 
for use, lay it into cold water for two or three hours, then wipe it dry, 
and it will have quite the efiect of the fresh leaf when made into 
paste.

three heaped teaspoonaful of 
sage, minced very small,

cayenne. Sew it up with soft, but strong cotton, truss it as a hare, 
with the fore legs skewered hack, and ttie hind ones forward ; lay it to 
a Btrong, clear fire, but keep it at a moderate distance, as it would 
quickly blister or scorch if placed too near. So soon as it has become 
warm, rub it with a bit of Initter, tie it in a fold of muslin, or of thin 
cloth, and repeat this pmcess constantly while it is roasting. When 
the gravy begins to drop from it, pet basins, or small deep tureens 
tinder, to catch it in. As soon as the pi? is of a fine light amber brown, 
aitd the steam draws strongly towards the fire, wipe it quite dry with a 
clean cloth, and rub a bit of cold butter over it When it is half done, 
a pig iron, or, in lieu of this, a large fiat iron should be hung in the 
ceutre of the grate, or the middle of the pig will be done long befrve 
the ends. When it is ready for table, lay it into a veiy ht^ dish, and 
be&re Che spit is withdrawn, t&ke off and open the head, and split the 
body in two ; chop together quickly the stuffing and the brams, put 
tbem Into half a pint of good veal gravy, ready Uiickened, add a glan 
of Madeira or of sherry, and the gravy which has dropped from the 
pig; pour a small portion of this under the meat, and serve the remain- 
der as hot as possible in a tureen ; a little pounded mace and cayenne, 
with a squeeze of lemon-juice, may be added, should the flavour require 
heightening. Fine bread sauce, and plain gravy should likewise be 
■erved with it. Some persons still prefer the old-&shianed currant 
sauce to any other ; and many have the brains and stuffing stirred 
itrto rich melted butter, instead of gravy; but the receipt miich wo 
have given has usually been so much approved, that we can recom- 
mend it with some confidence, as it stands. Modern taste would per- 
haps be rather in &voui of rich brown gravy and thick tomala sauce, or 
sauce Poivrade. 

In dishing the pig, lav the body flat in the middle, and the head and 
etirs at the ends am sides. When very pure oil can be obtained, it is 
preferable to butter for the basting; it should be laid on with a bunch 
of feathers. A suckling of three weeks old is considered as best suited 
to the spit; and it should always be dressed, if possible, the day it is 
billed.

Raise the flesh from the bones of a cold roast pig, free it from the 
crisp outer skin or crackling, and cut it down into small handsome 
slices. Dissolve a bit of butter the size of an egg^ and, if they can be 
easily procured, throw in a handful of button-mushrooms, cleaned and 
sliced ; shake these over the fire for three or four minutes, then stir to 
them a dessertspoonful of flour, and continue to shake or toss them 
gently, but do not allow them to brown. Add a small bunch of parsley,

of cayenne or white pepper, half a pint of ^od veal or beef bioth, and 
from two to three glasses of light white wme. Let these boil gently

beaten yolks of three fresh eggs, and the strained juice of half a lemon.

TO ROAST PORK. 

When the skin is left on the joint which is to be roasted, it must be 
scored in narrow strips of equal width, before it is put to t^e fire, and 
laid at a considerable distance from it at first, that the meat may be 
heated through before the skin hardens or begins to brown ; it must 
never stand still for an instant and the basting should be constant 
Pork is not at the present day much served at very good tables, parti- 
cularly in this form ; and it is so still less with the old savoury stufling 
of sage and onions, though some eaters like it always with the leg: 
whej] it is ordered for this joint therefore, prepare it as directed fbt a 
goose, at page 125, and after having loosened the skin from the knuckle^ 
insert as much as can well be secured in it A little clarified butter, 
or salad oil may be brushed over the skin quite at first particularly 
should the meat not be very fat but unless remarkably lean, it wiH 
speedily yield sufficient dripping to baste it with. Jomts from which 
the fiit Imls been pared will require, of course, fiir less roasting than 
those on which the crackling is retained. Brown gravy and apple or 
tomata sauce are the usual accompaniments to all roasts of pork, except 
a sucking pig ; they should always be thoroughly cooked.

TO ROAST ▲ SADDLB Of PORK. 

The skin of this joint may be removed entirely, but if left on it must 
be scored lengthwise, or in the direction in which it will be carved. 
The pork should* be young, of fine quality, and of moderate size. Roast 
It very carefully, either by the directions given in the preceding receipt, 
or when the skin is taken oS, by those for a saddle of mutton, allowing 
in the latter case from three quarters of an hour to a full hour more 
of the fire for it in proportion to its weight Serve it with good brown 
|rravy and tomata sauce, or sauce Robert; or with apple sauce should 
It be preferred. 20 minutes to the pound, quite. 

[to ROAl»r SPARE-RIB. 

Spare-rib should be rubbed with powdered sage mixed with salt and 
pepper, before it is roasted. It will require, if large and thick, two or 
three hours to roast it ; a very thin one may be roasted in an hour. 
Lay the thick end to the fire. When you put it down, dust ou some 
flour, and baste with a little butter. 

The shoulder, loin, and chine are roasted in the same manner. A 
shoulder is the most economical part to buy, and is excellent boiled. 
Pork is always salted before it is boiled. 

Apple-sauce is always proper to accompany roasted pork ; this, with 
potatoes, mashed or plam, mashed turnips, and pickles, is good.] 

to broil or fry FORK CUTLETS. 

Cut them about half an inch thick from a delicate loin of pork, trim 
them into neat form, and take ofifpart of the fiit, or the whole of it when 
it is not liked ; dredge a little pepper or cayenne upon them, and broil 
them over a clear and moderate fire from fifteen to eighteen minutes, 
sprinkle a little fine saU upon them just before they are dished. They 
may be dipped into egg and then into bread-crumbs mixed with mincea 
sage, then finished in the usual way. When fried, flour them well, 
and season them with salt and pepper first. Serve them with gravy 
made in the pan, or with sauce Robert. 

cobbett^s receipt for curing bacon; (extracted from his *^ Cottage 

Economy.^) 

^ All other parts being taken away, the two sides that remain, and 
which are called flitches, are to be cured for bacon. They are first 
rubbed with salt on their inside, or flesh sides, then placed one on the 
other, the flesh sides uppermost, in a salting trough, which has a gutter 
round its edges to dram away the brine ; for to have sweet and fine 
bacon, the flitches must not be sopping in brine, which gives it the sort 
of taste that barrel-pork and sea-junk have, and than which nothing is 
more villanous. Every one knows how different is the taste of fresh 
dry salt fix}m that of salt in a dissolved state. Therefore, change the 
saU often ; once in four or five days. Let it melt and sink in, but let 
it not lie too long. Change the fiitches,~put that at bottom which was 
first on the4x>p. Do this a couple of times. This mode will cost you a 
ffreat deal more in salt than the sopping mode ; but without it your 
Sacoil will not be so sweet and fine, nor keep so well. As to the time 
required for making the flitches sufficiently salt, it depends on circum- 
stances; the thickness of the flitch, the state of the weather, the place 
wherein the salting is gomg on. It takes a loafer time for a thick than

for a thin flitch ; it takes longer in dry than in damp weather; it takes 
longer in a dry than in a damp place. But for the flitches of a hog of 
five score, in weather not very dry or very damp, about six weeks may 
do ; and as yoars is to be faty which receives little injury from over- 
salting, give time enough ; for you are to have bacon until Christmas 
comes again. The place for salting should, like a dairy, always be 
cool, but always admit of a free circmation of air; confined air, though 
cool, will taint meat sooner than the mid-day sun accompanied with a 
breeze. With regard to smoking the bacon, two precautions are neces- 
sarv : first, to hang the flitches where no rain comes down upon them, 
and next, that the smoke must proceed from wood, not peat, turf nor 
coal. As to the time that it requires to smoke a flitch, it must depend 
a good deal upon whether there be a constant fire beneath^ and whether 
the fire be large or small. A month will do if the fire be pretty con- 
stant, and such as a farm-house fire usually is. But over-smoking, or 
rather, too long hanging in the air, makes the bacon rtl«^ Great atten- 
tion should, therefore, 1^ paid to this matter. The flitch ought not to 
be dried up to the hardness of a board, and yet it ought to be perfectly 
dry. Before you hang it up, lay it on the floor, scatter the flesh-side 
pretty thickly over with bran or with some fine saw-dust, nol of deal or 
fir. Rub it on the flesh, or pat it well down upon it This keeps the 
smoke from getting into the little openings, and makes a sort of crust 
to be dried on. 

"■ To keep the bacon sweet and good, and free from hoppers, sifl fine 
some clean and dry wood-ashes. Put some at the bottom of a box or 
chest long enough to hold a flitch of bacon. Lay in one flitch ; and 
then put in more ashes, then another flitch, and cover this with six or 
eight inches of the ashes. The place where the box or chest is kept 
ought to be dry, and should the ashes become d&mp they should be put 
in the fire-place to dry, and when cold, put back again. With these 
precautions the bacon will be as good at the end of the year as on the 
first day." 

Ohs, — Although the preceding directions for cufing the bacon are a 
/ittle vagne as regards the proportions of salt and pork, we think those 
fbr its afler-management will be acceptable to many of our readers, as 
in our damp climate it is often a matter of great difficulty to preserve 
hams and bacon through the year from rust 

A OENITINE YORKSHIRE RECEIFT FOR CT7RINO HAMS Ain> BACON. 

*' Let the swine be put up to fast for twenty-four hours before they 
are killed (and observe that neither a time of severe frost nor very damp 
weather is &vourable for curing bacon). After a pig has been killed 
and scalded, let it hang twelve hours before it is cut up, then for every 
stone, or foutteen pounds weight of the meat, take one pound of salt, an 
ounce and a quarter of saltpetre, and half an ounce of coarse sugar. 
Rub the sugar and saltpetre first into the fleshy parts of the pork, and 
remove carefully with a fork any extravasated blood that may appear 
on it, together with the broken vessels adjoining ; apply the salt espo- 
cially to those parts, as well as to the shank-ends of the hams, and any 
other portions of the flesh that are more particularly exposed. Before 
the salt is added tp the meat, warm it a little before the fire, and use 
only a part of it ui the first instance ; then, as it dissolves, or is absorbed

by the meat, add the remainder at seTend diSmeot tiausB, Let the 
meat in the mean while lie either on clean straw, or on a cold brick or 
Btone floor : it will require fix>m a f(»rtnight to three weeks' caring^ 
according to the state of the atmosphere. When done, hang it in a 
C4K>1 dry place, where there is a thorough current of air, and let it- 
remain tliere until it is perfectly dry, when the salt will be found to 
have crystallized upon the surface. The meat may then be removed 
to your store, and kept in a cloae chest, surrounded with clean outer 
9trau>, If very large, the hams will not be in perfection in less thaa 
twelve months from the time of their being stored.** 

Pork, 20 stone ; salt, 20 Iba ; saltpetre, 20 ozs. ; sugar 10 ozs. : 14 to 
21 days. 

KENTIftH MODE OF CfJmNQ UP AND OURINO A FIO. 

To a porker of sixteen stone Kentish weight, (that is to say, eight 
pounds to the stone, or nine sUme two pounds of common weight,) allow 
two gallons of salt, two pounds of saltpetre, one pound of coarse sugar, 
and two pounds of bay-salt, well dried and reduced to powder. Put 
aside the hams and cheeks to be cured by themselves ; let the feet, ears, 
tail, and eye-parts of the head be salted for immediate eating. The* 
blade-bones, and ends of the loins and ribs reserved for sausage-meat, 
should it be wanted, and the loin and spare-ribs for roasting. Divide 
and salt tbe remainder thus : Mix well together the saltpetre, sugar, 
and bay-salt, and rub the pork gently with them in every part; cover 
the boUom of the pickling tub with salt, and pack in the pork as closely 
as possible, with a portion of the remaining salt between each layer. A 
very little water is sometimes sprinkled in to facilitate the dissolving of 
the salt, into a brine, but this is better avoided, if possible, and in damp 
weather will not be needed. If in a fortnight it should not have risen, 
80 as almost entirely to cover the meat, boil a strong brine of salt, salt- 
petre, sugar, and bay-salt ; let it remain till perfectly cold, and then 
pour it over the pork. A board, with a heavy stone weight upon it, 
should be kept upon the meat, to force it down under the brine. In 
firom three to feur months it will be fit fer table, and will be^ delicate 
and exeellent pickled pork. 

The pickling parts of a porker of sixteen stone (Kentish weighty or 
niae sUne two pounds of common weight, or fourteen pounds to the

TRENCH BACON FOR LARDINO. 

' Cut the bacon from the pig with as little lean to it as possible. Rub 
it well in every part, with salt which has been dried, reduced to powder, 
and sifted ; put the layers of bacon close against and upon each other, 
in a shallow wooden trough, and set in a cool, but not a damp cellar; 
add more salt all round the bacon, and lay a board, with a very heavy 
weight upon it Let it remain for six weeks, then hang it up in a dry 
and airy place.

portion can be diminished one-half, and the qnantity of salt as much ift- 
creased. Bacon also may be cured by this receipt, or by the Bordyke 
one for hams. A month is safficient time for the salting, unless th6 
pork be very large, when five weeks must be allowed ibr a ham. The 
ingredients may be well mixed, and all ap|Hied at the same time.

HAMS StPfiBIOB TO WESTPHALIA. 

Take the hams as soon as the pig is sufficiently cold to be cut up^ 
rub them well with common salt, and leave them for three days to 
drain; throw away the hriae, and fix a couple of hams of from fifteen to 
eighteen pounds weight, mix together two ounces of saltoetre, a pound 
of coarse sugar, and a pound of common salt ; rub the liams in every 
part with these, lav them into deep pickling-pans with the rind down* 
wards, and keep them for tliree oays well Covered with the salt and 
sugar ; then nour over them a bottle of good vinegar, and turn them in 
the brine, ana baste them with it daily for a month; drain them wellf 
rub them with bran, and let tbem be hung for a month high in a chim* 
ney over a wood-fire to be smoked.

O69.— Such of our readers as shall make trial of this admiraUa 
receipt, will acknowledge, we doubt not, that the hams thus cured ar» 
in reality superior to those oi Westphalia. It was originally given to 
th^public by the celebrated French cook, Monsieur Ude, to whom, after 
havmg proved it, we are happy to acknowledge our obligation for it. 
He directs that the hams when smoked should be hung as high as possi- 
ble from the fire, that the &t may not be melted ; a very necessarv pr^ 
caution, as the mode of their being cured renders it peculiarly liable to 
do sa This, indeed, is somewhat perceptible in the cooking, whidi 
ought, therefore, to be conducted with especial care. The hams should 
be very softly simmered,* and not over-done. They should be large, and 
of finely-fed pork, or the receipt will not answer. We give the result 
of our first trial of it, which was perfectly successfiiL

TO BOIL ▲ HAM. 

The degree of soaking which must be given to a ham before it is 
boiled, must depend both on the manner in which it has been cured, 
%nd on its age. If highly salted, hard, and old, a day and night, or even 
ionger, may be requisite to dilate the pores sufficiently, and to extract a 
portion of the salt To do either efiectually the water must be several 
times changed during the steeping. We generally find hams cured bv 
any of the receipts which we have given in this chapter quite enough 
soaked in twelve hours; and they are more frequently laid into water 
only early in the morning of the day on which they are boiled. Those 
pickled by Monsieur Ude^s receipt need much less steeping than an^ 
others. After the ham has been scraped, or brushed, as clean as possi- 
ble, pare away lightly any part which, from being blackened or rusty, 
would disfigure it ; though it is be^er not to cut the flesh at alt unless 
it be really requisite for the good appearance of the joint Lay it into 
a ham-kettle, or into any other vessel of a similar form, and cover it 
plentifully with cold water ; bring it very slowly indeed to boil, and 
^clear ofi^ carefully the scum which will be thrown up in great abundance. 
So soon as the water has been cleared from this, draw back the pan 
quite to the edge of the stove, that the ham may be simmered softly, 
but steadily, until it is tender. On no account allow it to boil &st A 
bunch of herbs and three or four carrots, thrown in directly after the 
water has been skimmed, will improve it. When it can be probed very 
easily with a sharp skewer, or larding-pin, lift it out, strip off the skin, 
which may be kept to cover the ham when cold, and should there be 
an oven at hand, set it in for a few minutes, after having laid it on a 
drainer ; strew fine raspings over it, or grate a hard-toasted crust, or sift 
upon it the prepared bread of page 114, unless it is to be glazed, when 
neither of these must be used. 

' Small ham, 3^ to 4 hours ; moderate sized, 4 to 4 J hours ; very large, 
5 to 5^ hours. 

Obs. — We have seen the following manner of boiling a ham recom- 
mended, but we have not tried it: — "Put into the water in which it is 
to be boiled, a quart of old cider and a pint of vinegar, a large bunch of 
sweet herbs, and a bay-leaf. When it is two thirds done, skin, cover it 
with raspings, and sejt it in an oven until it is done enough : it will 
prove incomparably superior to a ham boiled in the usual way." 

FRENCH RECEIPT FOR BOILING A HAH. 

After having soaked, thoroughly cleaned, and trimmed the ham, put 
over it a little very sweet clean hay, and tie it up in a thin cloth ; place 



CHAP. XI.3 PORK. 195 

it in a ham kettle, a braising pan, or any other vessel as nearly of its 
size as can be, and cover it with two parts of cold water, and one of 
light white wine (we think the reader will perhaps find cider a good 
substitute for this) ; add, when it boils and has been skimmed, four or 
£ve carrots, two or three onions, a large bunch of savoury herbs, and 
the smallest bit of garlic. Let the whole simmer gently from four to 
five hours, or longer should the ham be very large. When perfectly 
tender, lift it out, take off the rind, and sprinkle over it some fine 
crumbs, or some raspings of bread mixed with a little finely minced 
parsley. 

TO RiLKE ▲ HAM. 

Unless when too salt, from not being sufficiently soaked, a ham (par- 
ticularly a young and fresh one) eats much better baked than boiled, 
and remains longer good. The safer plan is to lay it into plenty of cold 
water over night The following day soak it for an hour or more in 
warm water, wash it delicately clean, trim smoothly off all rusty parts, 
and lay it with the rind downwards into a coarse paste rolled to about 
^n inch thick ; moisten the edges, draw, pinch them together, and fold 
^em over on the upper side of the ham, taking care to close them so 
that no gravy can escape. Send it to a well-heated, but not a fierce 
oven. A very small ham will require quite three hours baking, and a 
large one five. The crust and the skin must be removed while it is 
hot When part only of a ham is dressed, this mode is better fiir than 
boiling it. 

TO BOIL BACON. 

When very highly salted and dried, it should be soaked for an hour 
before it is dressed. Scrape and wash it well, cover it plentifully with 
cold water, let it both heat and boil slowly, remove all the scum with 
care, and when a fork or skewer will penetrate the bacon easily lift it 
oat, strip off the skin, and strew raspings of bread over the top, or grate 
upon it a hard crust which has been toasted until it is crisp quite 
through ; or should it be at hand, use for the purpose the bread recom- 
mended at page 114, then dry it a little before the fire, or set it for a 
few minutes into a gentle oven. Bacon requires long boiling, but the 
precise tiine depends upon its quality, the flesh of young porkers be- 
coming tender much sooner than that of older ones ; sometimes, too, the 
manner in which the animal has been fed renders the meat hard, and it 
will then, unless thoroughly cooked, prove very indigestible. From ten 
to fifteen minutes less for the pound must be allowed for unsmoked 
bacon, or for pickled pcnrk. 

Smoked bacon (striped), 2 lbs., from 1} to 1^ hour; unsmoked bacon, 
or pork, 1 to 1| hour. 

Obs, — ^The thickest part of a large gammon of bacon will require 
firom twenty to thirty minutes longer biiling than the thinner side. 

BACON BROILED OB FRIED. 

Cut it evenly in thin slices, or rashefSt as they are generally called, 
pare from them all rind and rust, curl them round, fasten them with 
small slight skewers, then fry, broil, or toast them in a Butch oven ; 
draw out the skewers before they are ^ent to tabic A few minutes 
will dress them either way. They may also be cookeu without being 
curled. The rind shocdd always be taken ofll^ and the bacon gently

much dried, or hardened : it should be cut thin. Fry what egga you 
want in butter, and when diahed lay an egg on each slice of ham, and

i>RBMn> luaHEBa of baoor. 

Slice rather thicker than for frying, some cold boiled bacon, and strew 
it lightly on both sides with fine raspings of bread, or with a mted 
crust which has been very slowly and gradually toasted until brown 
quite through. Toast or warm the rashers in a Dutch oven, and serve 
them with veal cutlets, or any other delicate meat The bacon thus 
dressed is much nicer than when l»t>iled or fried without the previous 
boiling.

TONBBUKIB BEAWN. 

Split open the head of a middling-sized porker, remove the brain and 
all the bones, strew the inside rather thickly with fine salt, and let it 
dniin until the followinfif day. Cleanse the ears and feet in the same 
manner; wipe them allfirom the brine, lay them into a large p&n, and 
rub them well with an ounce and a lialr of saltpetre mixed with six 
ounces .of sugar; in twelve hours, add six ounces of salt; the next day 
pour a quarter-pint of good vinegar over them, and keep them turned in 
the pickle every twenty-four hours, for a week, then wash it off the ears 
and feet, and boil them for about an hour and a half; bone the feet 
while they are warm, and trim the gristle from the large ends of the 
ears. When these are ready, mix a large grated nutmeg with a tea- 
spoonful and a half of mace, half a teaspoonful of cayenne, and as much 
of cloves. Wash, but do not soak the head ; wipe and Aitten it on a 
board ; cut some of the flesh from the thickest parts, and (when the 
whole of the meat has been seasoned equally with the spices) lay it on 
the thinnest ; intermix it with that of the ears and feet, roll it np very 
tight, and bind it firmly with broad tape ; fold a thin pudding-cloth quite 
closely round it, and tie it securely at both ends. A braising-pan, from 
its form, is best adapted for boiling it, but if there be not one at hand, 
place the head in a vessel adapted to its size^ with the bones and trim- 
mings of the feet and ears, a large bunch of savoury herbs, two mode- 
rate-sized onions, a small head of celery, three or four carrots, a tet^ 
spoonful of peppercorns, and sufficient cold water to cover it well ; boil 
it very gently for four hours, and leave it until two parts c<^ in the 
liquor in which it was boiled. Take off the cloth, and put the brawn 
between two dishes or trenchers, with a heavy weight on the wpper one. 
The next day take off the fillets of tape» and serve the head whole or 
sliced.

[Pickled pork takes more time than other meat If you buy your 
pork ready salted, ask how many days it has been in salt ; if many, it 
will require to be soaked in water before you dress it When you cook 
it, wash and scrape it as clean as possible ; when delicately dressed, it 
is a favourite dish with almost every body. Take care it does not boil 
fast; if it does, the knuckle will break to pieces before the thick part of 
the meat is warm through ; a leg of seven pounds takes three hours and 
a half very slow simmering. Skim your pot very carefully, and when 
you take the meat out of the boiler, scrape it clean. 

The proper vegetables are parsnips, potatoes, turnips, or carrots. 
Some like cabbage, but it is a strong, rank vegetable, and does not 
agree with a delicate stomach.] 

SAVSAGB-MEAT CAKE, OR, PAIN DE PORG FRAIS. 

Season very highly from two to three pounds of good sausage-meat, 
both with spices and with sage, or with thyme and parsley, if these be 
preferred ; press the mixture into a pan, and proceed exactly as for the 
veal-cake of page 168. A few minced eschalots can be mixed with the 
meat for those who like their flavour. 

SAUSAGES. 

Common farm-house sausages are made with nearly equal parts of 
fy.i and lean pork, coarsely chopped, and seasoned with salt and pepper 
only. They are put into skins (which have previously been turned 
inside out, scraped very thin, washed with exceeding nicety, and wiped 
Tery dry), then twisted into links, and should be hun^ in a cool airy 
laraer, when they will remain good for some length of time. Odd scraps 
and trimmings of pork are usually taken for sausage-meat when the pig 
is killed and cut up at home ; but the chine ana blade-bone are pre- 
ferred in general for the purpose. The pork rinds, as we have already 
stated, wul make a strong and almost flavourless jelly, which may be 
Used with excellent efiect for stock, and which, with the addition of 
Bome pOrk-bones, plenty of vegetables, and some dried peas, will make 
a very nutritious soup for those who do not object to the pork-flavour 
which the bones will give. Half an- ounce of salt, and nearly or quite 
a quarter-ounce of pepper will sufficiently season each pound of the 
nusage-meat 

KENTISH SAUSAGE-MEAT. 

To three pounds of lean pork add two of fat, and let both be taken 
clear of skin. As sausages are lighter, though not so delicate when 
the meat is somewhat coarsely chopped, this difference should be at- 
tended to in making them. When the fet and lean are partially mixed, 
strew over them two ounces and a half of dry salt, beaten to powder, 
and mixed with one ounce of ground black pepper, and three large 
tablespoonsfiil of sa^e, very finely minced. Turn the meat with the 
cbopping-knife, until die ingredients are well blended. Test it before 
lit is taken off the block, by frying a small portion, that if more season

portion to their size. This applies equally to geeae and ducks, of which 
the t»ee«t* likewise should be very plump, ana the feet yellow and flex- 
ible : when these are red and hard, the bills of (he same colour, and the 
■Un full of hairs, and eitremely coarse, the birds are old. 

White-legged fowls and chickens should be chosen Ibr boiling', be- 
caow their appearance is the most delicate when dressed ; but the dark-

are the better for being so, and are thought to lose their flavour by 
hanging even a day or twa Turkeys, as we have stated in our receipts 
for them, are very tough and poor eating if not sufficiently long kept 
A goose, a]^ in winter, should hang some days before it is dressed, and 
fowls, likewise, will be improved by it 

All kinds of poultry should be thoroughly cooked, though without 
being over-done, for nothing in general can more effectually destroy the 
appetite than the taste ana appearance of their flesh when brought to 
table half roasted or boiled. 

TO BONE ▲ FOWL OB TVBKET WITHOUT OPENING IT. 

After the fowl has been drawn and singed, wipe it inside and out with 
a clean cloth, but do not wash it Take off the head, cut through the 
skin all round the first joint of the legs, and pull them from the fowl^ 
to draw out the large tendons. Raise the flesh first from the lower part 
of the back-bone, and a little also fh>m the end of the breast-bone, if 
necessary ; work the knife gradually to the socket of the thigh ; with 
the point of the knife detach the joint from it, take the end of the bone 
firmly in the fingers, and cut the flesh clean from it down to the next 
joint, round which pass the point of the knife carefijUy, and when the 
skin is loosened from it in every part, cut round the next bone, keeping 
the edge of the knife close to it, until the whole of the leg is done. 
Remove the bones of the other leg in the same manner ; then detach 
the fledi from the back and breast-bone sufficiently to enable you to 
reach the upper joints of the wings ; proceed with these as with the 
le^ but be especially careful not to pierce the skin of the second joint: 
it IS usual to leave the pinions unboned, in order to give more easily its 
natural form to the fowl when it is dressed. The meiry-thought and 
neck-bones may now easily be cut away, the back and side-bones taken 
out without being divided, and the breast-bone separated cafefully -from 
the flesh (which, as the work progresses; must be turned back firom the 
bones upon the fowl, until it is completely inside out). After the one 
remaining bone is removed, draw the wings and legs back to their pro- 
per form, and turn the fowl the right side outwards. 

A turkey is boned exactly in the same manner, but as it requires a 
very large proportion of forcemeat to fill it entirely, the legs and wins* 
are sometimes drawn into the body, to diminish the expense of th]& 
If very securely trussed, and sewn, the bird may be either boiled, or 
stewed in rich gravy, as well as roasted, after being boned and forced. 

ANOTHER MODE OF BONING ▲ FOWL OR TURRET. 

Cut through the skin down the centre of the back, and raise the flesh 
carefully on either side with the point of a sharp knife, until the socketB 
of the wings and thighs are reached. Till a little practice has been 
gained, it will perhaps be better to bone these joints before proceeding 
further; but after they are once detached from it, the whole of the 
body may easily be separated fh>m the flesh and taken out entire : only 
the neck-bones and merrythought will then remain to be removed. 
The bird thus prepared maj either be restored to its original form, by 
fillmg the legs and winjrs with forcemeat, and the body with the livers 
of two or three fowls, if^ey can be procured, mixed with alternate lay* 
ers of parboiled tongue, fireed from the rind, fine 8au8r.ge meat, or veal

fbiceraeat, or thin slites of the nicest bacon, or aaght else of good fla- 
vour, which will give a marbled appearance to Sie fowl when it is 
carved ; and then be sewn np and trussed as usual ; or the legs and 
wings may be drawn inside the body, and the bird being first flattened 
tm a table may be covered with sausage meat, and the various other 
ingredients we have named, so placed that it shall be of equal thickness 
in every part ; then tijghtly rolled, bound firmly together with a fillet of 
broad tape, wrapped in a thin pudding-cloth, closely tied at both ends, 
and dressed as follows : — Put it into a braising-pan, stewpan, or thick 
iron saucepan, bright in the inside, and fitted as nearly as may be to its 
size ; add all the chickeQ-bones, a bunch of sweet herbs, two carroty 
two bay-leaves, a large blade of mace, twenty-four white peppercorns, 
and any trimmings or bones of undressed veal which may be at hand ; 
cover the whole with good veal-broth, add salt, if needed, and stew it 
very softly, from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half; let it cool 
in the liquor in which it was stewed ; and after it is lifted out, boil down 
the gravy to a jelly and strain it; let it become ccdd, clear off the fiit, 
and serve it cut into large dice or rouffhed, and laid round the fowl, 
which is to be served cokL If restored to its form, instead of being 
rolled, it must be stewed gently for an hour, and may then be sent to 
table hot, covered with mushroom, or any other good sauce that may be 
preferred ; or it may be left until the following day, and served gar- 
nished with the jelly, which should be firm, am! ver)iBlear and well- 
flavoured: the bquoF in which the cairs foot has been boiled down, 
aikied to the broth, will give it the necessary degree of consistency. 
French cooks add three or four onions to these preparations of poultry 
(the last of which is called a galaitiine) ; but these our own taste would 
lead us to reject 

Rolled, 1^ to li hour; galantine, 1 hour.

wipe, the outside well, without wetting it, and pour water plentifully 
through the inside. Fill the breast with forcemeat (No. 1, page I:<22), 
or with the finest sausage meat, highly seasoned with minced herbs; 
lemon-rind, mace, and cayenne. Truss the bird firmly, lay it to a clear

sound fire, baste it constantly and bountifiilly with batter, and serve it 
when done with good brown gravy, and well-made bread sauce. An 
entire chain of delicate fried sausages is still often placed in the dish, 
round a turkey, as a garnish. 

It is usual to fold and fasten a sheet of buttered writing-paper over 
the breast to prevent its being too much coloured : this should be re- 
moved twenty minutes before the bird is done. The £)rcemeat of 
chestnuts (No. 15, Chapter VI.) may be very advantageously substi- 
tuted for the commoner kinds in stuffing it, and the body may then be 
filled with chestnuts, previously stewed until tender in rich gravy, or 
simmered over a slow fire in plenty of rasped bacon, with a high sea- 
soning (^ mace, nutmeg, and cayenne, until they are so ; or, instead of 
this, well-made chestnut sauce, or a dish of stewed chestnuts, may be 
sent to table with the turkey. 

1^ to 2^ hours. 

Obs. — A turkey should be laid at first far from the fire, and drawn 
nearer when half done, though never sufficiently so to scorch it ; it 
should be well roasted, for even the most inveterate advocates of under- 
dressed meats will seldom tolerate the taste or sight of partially-raw 
poultry. 

TO BOIL A TURRET. 

A delicate la^ plump hen-turkey of 
moderate size should be selected for 
boiling. Pick and draw it, using the 
greatest precaution not to break the 
gall bladder; singe it with writing 
paper, take off the head and neck, cut 
through the skin round the first joint 
of the legs, and draw them off: this 
is best accomplished by listening the Turkey for Boiling, 

feet to a strongr hook, and then pulling' the bird away from it Wash it 
exceedingly clean, and then wipe it dry ; fill the breast with the force- 
meat No. 1 or 2 of Chapter VI;, or with the ouster, chestnut, or French 
forcemeat, of which the receipts are given m the same chapter. In 
truwing it draw the legs into the body, break the breast-bone, and give 
the turkey as round and plump an appearance as can be. Put it into 
plenty of warm water, clear off the scum with the greatest care as it is 
thrown to the surface, and boil the bird very gently from an hour and a 
half to two hours and a quarter. A very large turkey would require a 
longer time, but it is unsuited to this mode of cooking. When the 
oyster-forcemeat is used, a large tureen of rich oyster sauce should 
accompany the dish ; but celery sauce, or good white sauce, may other 
wise be sent to table with it ; and a boil^ ton^e or a small ham is 
usually served in addition. For a plain &mily dmner, a delicate cheek 
of bacon is sometimes substituted for either of these, and parsley and 
butter for a more expensive sauce. Fast boiling will cause the skin of 
the bird to break, and must therefore be especially avoided : it should 
hang for some days before it is dressed, for if quite freshly killed it will 
not be tender, but it must be perfectly sweet to be fit for table. 

Moderate-sized turkey, 1^ to 2 hours; large turkey, longer; very 
•mall one, less time.

TTRKET BONED AND FORCED ; (an excellent at9h,) 

Take a small, well-kept, but quite sweet hen-turkey, of from seven to 
eight pounds weight, and remove, by the receipt for a fowl (pa^e 200), 
all the bones except those of the pinions, without opening the bird ; 
draw it into shape, and fill it entirely with exceedingly fine sausage- 
meat, beginning with the le^ and wings; plump the breast well in pre* 
paring it, and when its origmal form is quite restored, tie it securely at 
tx>th ends, and at the extremities of the legs ; pass a slight iron skewer 
through these and the body, and another Sirough the wings and body ; 
then lay a twine over the back of the turkey, and pass it under the ends 
of the first skewer, cross it in the centre of the back, and pass it under 
the ends of the second skewer ; then carry it over the pinions to keep 
them firmly in their place, and fasten it at the n^k. When a cradle 
cppit, of which the engraving below shows the form, and which opens 



 




Cradle Spit. 

with a joint to receive the roast, is not at hand, a bottle-jack will be 
found more convenient than any other for holding the turkey ; and after 
the hook of this is passed through the neck, it must be further supported 
by a string running across the back and under the points of the skewer 
which confines the pinions to the hook ; fer, otherwise, its weight would 
most probably cause it to fiill. Flour it well, place it fiir from the fire 
until it is heated through, and baste it plentifully and incessantly with 
butter. An hour and three quarters will roast it well. Break and 
boil down the bones for gravy in a pint and a half of water, with a little 
salt, a few slices of celery, a dozen corns of pepper, and a branch or 
two of parsley. Brown gently in a morsel of good butter, a couple of 
ounces of lean ham, add to them a slight dredge of flour, and a little 
cayenne, and pour to them the broth from the ^nes, after, it has boiled 
an hour, and been strained and skimmed ; shake the stewpan well round, 
and stew the gravy until it is wanted for table ; clear it entirely frqm 
fat ; strain, and serve it very hot 

The turkey may be partially filled with the forcemeat No. 1 or 3, of 
Chapter VL, and the sausage-meat may then be placed on either side 
of it 

Hen turkey between 7 and 8 lbs. weight, boned, filled with sausage- 
meat, 3 to 4 lbs. ; or witii forcemeat No. 1, or with No. 3, Chapter Vl., 
1 lb. (that is to say, 1 lb. of bread-crumbs, and the other ingredients in 
proportion.) Sausage-foeat, 2 to 3 lbs. roasted 1} hour. 

Obs. — When a common spit is used for the turkey, it must be fka- 
tened 2o, and not put upon it. 

Bread sauce can be served with the bird, or not, at pleasure. 

It will be found an improvement to moisten the sausage-meat with 
one or two spoonsful of water : it should be finely minced, well spiced, 
and mixed with herbs, when the common forcemeat is not used in addi- 
tion. In preparing it a pound and a quarter of f^ should be mixed with 
each pound of the lean.

To give the turkey a very good appeanmce, the breast may be larded 
by the directions of page l39. 

TURKEY A tA FLAMANDE, OR, DIIVDB POUDREB. 

Prepare as for boiling a fine well-kept hen turkey ; wipe the inside 
th(Hrooghly with a dry cloth, but do not wash it; throw in a little salt to 
draw out the blood, let it remain a couple of hours or more, then drain 
and wipe it again ; next, rub the outside in every part with about feur 
ounces of fine dry salt, mixed with a large tablespoonful of pounded 
sugar; rub the turkey well with these, and turn it every day for foux 
days ; then fill it entirely with equal parts of choice sausage-meat, and 
of the crumb of bread soaked in boiling milk or crean^, and wrung dry 
in a cloth ; season these with the grated rind of a large lemon, a small 
nutmeg, some mace, cayenne, and fine herbs, in the same proportion as 
for veal forcemeat (No. 1, page 122.) Sew the turkey up verv securely, 
and when trussed, roll it m a cloth, tie it closely at both ends, and boil 
It very gently between three and four hours. When taken up, sprinkle 
it thick^ with fine crumbs of bread, mixed with plenty of parsley, shred 
extremely small. Serve it cold, with a sauce made of the strained 
juice and g^ted rind of two lemons, a t^spoonful of made-mustard, and 
one of pounded su^r, with as much oil as will prevent its being more 
than pleasantly acid, and a little salt, if needed; wotk these together 
until perfectly mixed, and send them to table in a tureen. 

This receipt was e^iven to us abroad, by a Flemish lady, who had had 
the dish often servecTwith great success m Paris. We have inserted it 
on her authority, not on our own experience ; but we think it may be 
quite depended on. 

TO ROAST A G008B. 

After it has been picked and singed with care, pot into the body of 

the goose two parboiled onions of mode- 
rate size, finely chopped, and mixed with 
half an ounce of mmced sage-leaves, a 
saltepoonful of salt, and half as much black 
pepper, or a proportionate Quantity of cay- 
enne ; to these add a small slice of ftesb. 
Goon ready for the Spit. butter. Truss the goose, and after it is on 
the spit, tie it firmly at both ends that it may turn steadily, and that the 
seasoning may not escape; roast it at a brisk fire, and keep it con- 
stantly basted. Serve it with brown gravy, and apple, or tomata sauce. 
When the taste is in favour of a stronger seasoning than the above, 
which occurs, we apprehend, but seldom, use raw onions for it, and in- 
crease the quantity ; but should one still milder be preferred, mix a 
handful of fine bread-crumbs with the other ingredients, or two or three 
minced apples. The body of a goose is sometimes filled entirely with 
mashed potatoes, which, for this purpose, ought to be boiled very dry, 
and well blended with two or three ounces of butter, or with some thick 
cream, some salt, and white pepper or cayenne : to these minced sage 
and parboiled onions can also be added at pleasure. A teaspoonfiil of 
made-mustard, half as much of salt, and a small portion of cayenne, 
smoothly mixed with a glass of pent wine, are sometimes poured into 
the goose just before it is served, through a cot made in the apron, 
li to labour.

06«. — ^We extract, fhr the benefit of otfr reader^ from a work in bur 
posseesion, the following passage, of which we have had no oppor- 
tunity of testing the correctness. ** Geese, with sage and onions, may 
be deprived of power to breathe forth any incense, thus : — Pare from a 
lemon all the yellow rind, taking care not to bruise the fruit nor to cut 
80 deeply as to let out the juice. Place this lemon in the centre of the 
seasoning within the bird. When or before it is brought to table, let 
the flap be gently opened, remove the lemon with a tablespoon ; avoid 
breaking, and let it iiistandy be thrown away, as its white pithy skin 
will have absorbed all the gross particles which dse would have 
escaped." 

' TO KOAST A GRSSN GOOHn. 

Season the inside with a.little pepper and salt, and roast the goose at 
a brisk fire from forty to fifty minutes. Serve it with good brown gravy 
only, and sorrel sauce. 

t6 BOAsrr jl fowu 

Strip ofiT the feathers, and carefbtly pick every stump or plug from 
the skin, as nothing can be more uninviting tiian the appearance of any 
kind of poultry where this has been 
neglected, nor jnore indicative of slo- 
venliness on the part of the cook. 
Take off the head and neck close to 
the body, but leave sufficient of the 
skin to tie over the part that is cut. 
In drawing the bird, do not open it 
more than is needful, and use' great Fowl for Roasting, 

precaution to avoid breaking the gall-bladder. Hold the legs in boiling 
water for two or three minutes, that the skin may be peeled from them 
easrly ; cut off the claws, and then, with a bit of lighted writing-paper, 
singe off the hairs without blackening the fowl. Wash, and wipe it 
afterwards very dry, and let the liver and gizzard be made delicately 
cleaTi, and fiLstened into the pinions. Trusi?, and spit it firmly ; fiour 
it well when first laid to the fire, baste it frequently with butter, and 
when it is done, d^aw out the skewers, dish it, pour a little good gravy 
over, and send it to table with bread, mushroom, eg^ chestnut, or olive 
sauce. A common mode of serving roast fowls' in Prance is aux cres' 
$ons, that is, laid upon young water-cresses, which have previously been 
freed from the outer leaves, thoroughly w^ashed, shaken dry in a clean 
cloth, and ^inkled with a little fine salt, and a small quantity of vine« 
gar : these shottld cover the dish, and after the fowls are placed on them« 
gravy should be poured over as usual. 

The body of a fowl may be filled with very small mushrooms pre- 
pared as for pa^idgee (see partridges with mushrooms), then sewn up, 
roasted, and served with mushroom-sauce : this is an excellent mode of 
dressing it A slice of fresh butter mixed with some salt and cayenne 
or pepper ; a little rasped baoon; or a bit or two of the lean of beef or 
veal minced, or cut into dice, may be put inside the bird when either is 
considered an improvement An ounce or two of fresh butter smoothly 
mixed with a teaspooniul of realfy good mushroom-powder, a little 
pounded mace, nitf and cayenne, will impart much more of flavour to 
the fi>wl.

206 MODEBN COOKXRT. [OBAF. XII. 

Full-iized fowl, 1 hour : yoang chicken, 25 to 35 minutei. 

OI/». — As we have already observed in our general remaika on roast- 
ing, the time must be regulated hy various circumalances, which we 
named, and which the cook should always lake into consideration. A 
buttered paper should be jastened over the breast, and removed about 
fifteen minutes before the fowl is served : tbia will {vevent its taking 
too much colour. 

BOAflT FOWL ; (a French Rectipl.') 

Fill the breast of a fine fowl with good forcemeat, roast it as usm 1, 
and when it is very nearly ready to serve take it from the fire, pour 
lukewarm butler over it in every port, and strew it thickly with veiy 
Sne bread-criimba; spriokle these amin with butter, and dip the fowl 
into more crumbe. Put it down to th^ fire, and when it is c^ a clear, 
light brown all over, take it carefully from the spit, dish, and serve it 
with lemon-sauce, and with gravy thickened and mixed with plenty of 
minced parsley, or with brown gravy and- any other sauce usually served 
with fowls. Savoury herbs slired small, spice, and lemon-grate, may 
be mixed with the crumbe at pleasure. Do not pour gravy over the 
fowl when it is thus prepared.

Bone a fowl without opening the back, and reelore it lo its original 
form by filling the vacant spaces in the lemand wings with forcemeat; 
put a roll of it also into the body, and a mrge sausage on either side; 
tie it very securely at both ends, truss it with fine skewers, and roast it 
for a full hour, keeping it basted plentifully with butter. When ap- 
pearance is not regard^, the pinions may be taken ofi*, and the legs and 
wings drawn inside the fowl, which wifl then require a much smaller 
proportion of forcemeat : — that directed for veal (Na 1, page 122), will 
answer quite well in a general way, but for a dinner of ceremony. No. 
17 or 16 of the same Chapter should be. used in preference. The fowl 
must be lied securely to the spit, not put upon it. Bone chickens are 
excellent when entirely filled with well-made mushroom-forcemeat, ol 
very delicate and nicely seasoned sausage-meat ; and etthec roasted or 
slewed. Brown gravy, or mushroom sauce should then be sent to table 
with them.

they are put in. A full-eized fowl will require about three quarters of 
an hoar from the time of its beginning to simmer ; but young chickens 
not more than from twenty to twenty-five minutes : they should be »f ry 
gently boiled, and the scum should be removed with great care as it 
gathers on the surface of the water. Either of the following sauces 
may be sent to table with them : parsley and butter, bechamel, Englisli 
white sauce, oyster, celery, or white-mushroom sauce. The fowls are 
often dished with small tufts of delicately-boiled cauliflower placed 
round them ; or with young vegetable marrow, scarcely larger than an 
egg, merely pared and halved after it is dressed : white sauce must be 
served with both of these. The livers and gizzards are not, at the 
present day, usually served in the wings of boiled fowls. When they 
are not so, the livers may be simmereid for four or five minutes, then 
pressed to a smooth paste with a wooden spoon, and mixed very gradu- 
ally with the sauce, which should not boil after they are added. 

Full-sized fowl, f hour : young chickens^ 20 to 25 minutes. 

Obs, — ^Half a gallon of cold added to an equal quantity of boiling 
water, will bring it to the proper degree of heat for putting in the 
fowls. For richer modes of boiling poultry, see Blanc and PoHee^ 
Chapter VIL 

TO BROIL A CHICKEN OR FOWL. 

Either of these, when merely split and broiled, is very dry and unsa- 
voury eating; but will be greatly improved if first boiled gently from 
five to ten minutes and left to become cold, then divided, dip{^ into egg 
and well seasoned bread-crumbs, plentifully sprinkled with clarified 
butter, dipped again into the crumbs, and broiled over a clear and ffenUe 
fire from half to three quarters of an hour. It should be served very 
hot, with mushroom-sauce, or with a little good plain gravy, which may 
be thickened and flavoured with a teaspoonful of mushroom powder 
(should it be at hand), mixed with half as much flour and a little butter; 
or with some Espagnole. It should be opened at the back, and evenly 
divided quite through ; the legs should be trussed like those of a boiled 
fowl ; the breast-bone, or that of the back may be removed at pleasure, 
and both sides of the bird should be made as. flat as they can, that the 
fire may penetrate every part equally ; the inside should be first laid 
towards it The neck, feet, and gizzard may be boiled down with a 
small quantity of onion and carrot previously browned in a morsel of 
butter, to make the gxK\y ; and the liver, after having been simmered 
with them for five or six minutes, may be used to thicken it after it is 
strained. A teaspoonful of lemon-juice, some cayenne, and minced 
parsley should be added to it, and a little arrow-root, or flour and butter.

white peppercorns, to make the gravy, which, afler being strained and 
cleared from fat, may be poured hot to some thickening made in the 
pan with a slice of fresh butter and a dessertspoonful of flour : a tea- 
spoonful of mushroom-powder would improve it greatly, and a small 
quantity of lenion-pickle or juice should be added be&re it is poured 
out, with salt and cayenne if required. Pile the cutlets high in the 
middle of the dish, and serve the sauce under them, or in a tureen. 

CUTLETS OF V0WI4, PARTKn>OB8, OR PIORONBL (EJITREE.) 

{French Receipt.) 

Take closely off the flesh of the breast and wing together, on either 
side of the bone, and when you have thus raised the large fiUels, as 
they are called, from three birds, which will give you but six cutlets^ 
take the strips of flesh that lie under the wings, and that of the merry- 
thoughts, and flatten two or three of these together, that you may have 
nine cutlets at least, of equal size. When all are ready, fry to a pale 
brown as many diamond-shaped sippets of bread as there are fillets of 
fowl, and let them be quite as large; place these before the fire to dry, 
and wipe out the pan. Dip the cutlets into some yolks of eggs mixed 
with a little clarified butter, and strew them in every part with the 
finest bread-crumbs, moderately seasoned with salt, cayenne, and 
pounded mace. Dissolve as much good butter as will be required to 
dress them, and fry them in it of a li^ht amber-colour : arrange them 
upon the sippets of bread, pile them high in the dish, and pour a rich 
lirown gravy or Sauce Espagnole round, but not over them. 

FRIED OKICKEN A LA MALABAR. (ENTR£E.) 

This .is an Indian dish. Cut up the chicken, wipe it dry, and rub it 
well with currie-powder, mixed with a little salt ; fry it in a bit of but-

ter, taking care that it is of a nice light brown. In the meantime cut 
two or three onions into thin slices, draw them out into rings, and cut 
the rings into little bits, about half an inch long ; fry them for a long 
time gently in a little bit of clarified butter, until they have gradually 
dried up and are oi a delicate yellow-brown. Be careful that they are 
not burnt, as the burnt taste of a single bit would spoil the flavour of 
the whole. When they are as dry as chips, without the least grease or 
moisture upon them, mix a little salt with them, strew them over the 
fried chicken, and serve up with lemon on a plate. 

We have extracted this receipt from a clever little work called the 
" Hand-Book of Cookery." 

HASHED FOWL. (eMTREB.) 

Afler having taken oS, in joints, as much of a cold fowl or fowU as 
will suffice for a dish, bruise the bodies with a paste roller, pour to them 
a pint of water, and boil them for an hour and a half to two hours, with 
the addition of a little pepper and salt only, or with a small quantity of 
onion, carrot, and herbs. Strain, and skim the fat from the gravy, put 
it into a clean saucepan, and, should it require thickening, stir to it 
when it boils half a teaspoonfiil of flour, smoothly mixed with a small 
bit of butter; add a little mushroom catsup, or store-sauce, with a slight 
seasoning of mace or nutmeg. Lay in the fowl, and keep it near the 
fire until it is heated quite through, and is at the point of boiling : serve 
it with fried sippets round the dish. For a hash of higher relish, add 
to the bones, when they are first stewed down, a large onion, minced 
and browned in butter, and before the fowl is dished add some cayenne, 
and the juice of half a lemon. 

MiNGBD FOWL. (ENTREE.) {FVench Receipt.) 

Raise from the bones all the more delicate parts of the flesh of either 
cold roast, or cold boiled fowls, clear it fi^m the skin, and keep it co- 
vered from the air until wanted for use. Boil the bones, well bruised, 
and the skin, with three quarters or a pint of water, until reduced quite 
half, then strain the gravy and let it cool ; next, having first skimmed 
off the fat, put it into a clean saucepan, with a quarter-pint of cream^ 
an ounce and a half of butter, well mixed with a dessertspoonful of 
flour, a little pounded mace, and grated lemon-rind ; keep these stirred 
until they boil, then put in the fowl, finely minced, with three or four 
hard-boiled eggs, chopped small, and sufficient salt, and white pepper, 
or cayenne, to season it properly. Shake the mince over the fire until 
it is just ready to boil, stir to it quickly a squeeze of lemon-juice, dish 
it with pale sippets of fried bread, and serve it immediately. When 
cream cannot easily be obtained, use milk, with a double quantity of 
butter and flour. The eggs may be omitted ; the mince may be warmed 
in good white sauce, and a border formed round it of leaves^ of pastry, 
fri^ or baked ; or it may be served in a vol-au-venL Poached eggs are 
sometimes laid over it, and a garnish of curled bacon is placed round 
the edge. Another excellent variety of the dish is also made by co- 
vering the fowl thickly with very fine bread-crumbs, moistening them 
with clarified butter, and giving them colour with a salamander, or in 
a quick oven.*

that they may all absorb a portion of the acid ; then dip them one by. 
one into some French batter (see page 113), and fry them a pale brown 
over a gentle fire. Serve them garnished with, very green crisped 
parsley. A few drops of eschalot vinegar n^uy be mixed with the 
femon-jnice which is poured to the fowls, or slices o€. raw onion 06

SCAIXOF8 OF FOWL, XV BSCHAMEL. (ENTREB.) 

Raise the flesh from a couple of fowls, as directed for cutlets in the 
foregoing receipt, and take it as entire as possible from either side of 
the breast ; strip off the skin, lay the fillets flat, and slice them into 
small thin scallops; dip them one by one into clarified butter, and 
arrange them evenly in a delicately clean and not large frying-pan.; 
sprinkle a seasoning of fine salt over, and just before the dish is wanted' 
for table, fry them quickly without allowing them to brown ; drain them, 
well from the butter, pile them in the centre of a hot dish, and sauce 
them with some boiling bechamel, This dish, may be quickly prepared 
by taking a ready-dressed fowl from the spit or stewpan, and b^ raising,

ORILLADE OF C!OLD FOWLS. 

Carve and soak the remains of roast fowls as above, wipe them dry* 
dip them into clarified butter, and then into fine bread-crumbs, and broil- 
them gently over a, very clear fire. A little finely-minced lean of ham, 
or crated lemon-peel, with a seasoning of cayenne, salt, and mace, mixed' 
with the crumbs, will vary this dish agreeably. When fried, instead, 
of broiled, the fowls may be dipped into yolk of egg, instead of butter, 
but this renders them too dry for the gridiron. 

COLD FOWLS ; (the H&usekeeper's Receipt ; a Supper Disk,) 

Cut very equally a sufficient number of slices from a cold ham, to 
form two or even three layers round the rim of the dish which is to be 
sent to table. Place the fowls, neatly carved and trimmed, in the 
centre, with some branches of curled parsley, or other light foliage 
amongst them. Cold tongue may be substituted for the ham with id- 
vantage. This dish has a handsome appearance, and is convenient for 
the purpose of quick serving.

the second course, dish them upon young water-cresses, as directed for 
roast fowl aiue cressotu^ page 205. About twenty minutes will roast 
them.

throw in a little salt, and in fifteen minutes lift them out, pour parsley 
and butter over, and send a tureen of it to table with them. 

[to STEW PIGEONS. 

Wash and clean six pigeons, cut them into quarters, and put all their 
giblets with them into a stewpan, a piece of butter, a little water, a bit 
of lemon-peel, two blades of mace, some chopped parsley, salt, and pep- 
per ; cover the pan closely, and stew them till they are tender ; thicken 
the sauce with the yolk of an egg beaten up with three table-spoonsful 
of cream and a bit of butter dusted with flour; let them stew ten

TO CHOOSE GAME. 



Buck venison, which is in season only from June to Michaelmas, ih 
considered finer than doe venison, which comes into the market in 
October, and remains in season through November and December: 
neither should be cooked at any other part of the year. The greater

Hares and rabbits are stiff when freshly killed, and if young, the 
ears tear easily, and the claws are smooth >nd sharp. A hare in cold 
weather will remain good ftom ten to fourteen days; care only must be 
taken to prevent the inside from becoming musty, which it will do if it

the weather; bntUhe joint must then be not only well washed, bat 
soaked some considerable time, and this would be injurious to it: the 
acid, therefore, should only be resorted to for the purpose of restoring to 
an eatable state that which would otherwise be lost, from having been 
kept beyond the point in which it is possible to serve it 

To prepare the venison fi)r the spit, wash it slightlv with tepid water, 
or merely wipe it thoroughly with damp cloths, and dry it afterwards 
with clean ones ; then lay over the fat side a large sheet of thickly- 
buttered paper, and next a paste of flour and water about three quarters 
of an inch thick ; cover this again with two or three sheets of stout 
paper, secure the whole well with twine, and lay the haunch to a sound 
clear fire; baste the paper immediately with butter, or clarified drip- 
ping, and roast the joint from three hours and' a half to four and a half, 
according to its weight and quality. Doe venison will require half an 
liour less time than buck venison. Twenty minutes before the joint is 
done remove the paste and paper, baste the meat in every part with 
butter, and dredge it very lightly with flour ; let it take a pale brown 
colour, and send it to table as hot as possible with unflavoured gravy in 
a tureen, and good currant-jelly. It is not now customary to serve any 
other sauces with it ; but should the old-fashioned sharp or sweet sauce 
be ordered, the receipt for it will be found at page 88.* 

3j^ to 4 j hours. 

TO 8TEW A SHOULDER OF TEMISON. 

Bone the joint, by the directions given for a shoulder of veal or mut- 
ton (see page 166) ; flatten it on a table, season it well with cayenne, 
salt, and pounded mace, mixed with a very small proportion of allspice ; 
lay over it thin slices of the fat of a loin of well-fed mutton, roll and 
bind it tightly, lay it into a vessel nearly of its size, and pour to it as 
much gcod stock made with equal parts of beef and mutton as will 
nearly cover it ; stew it as slowly as possible from three hours to three 
and a half or longer, should it be very large, and turn it when it is half 
done. Dish and serve it with a good Espagnole, made with part of the 
gravy in which it has been stewed ; or thicken this slightly with rice- 
flour, mixed with a glass or more of claret or of port wine, and as much 
salt and cayenne as will season the gravy properly. 

Some cooks soak the slices of mutton-fiit in wine before they are laid 
upon the joint; but no process of the sort will ever give to any kind of 
meat the true flavour of the venison, which to most eaters is far finer 
than that of the wine, and should always be allowed to prevail over all 
the condiments with which it is dressed. Those, however, who care 
for it less than for a dish of high artificial savour, can have eschalots, 
ham, and carrot, lightly browned in good butter, added to the stew when 
it first begins to boil. 

3^ to 4 hours. 

TO HASH VENISON.t 

For a superior hash of venison, add to three quarters of a pint of 
strong thickened brown gravy, Christopher North's sauce, in the propor- 

* Plates of minced eschalot»are still sometimes banded round to the venison-eaters, 
but not at very refined tables, we believe.

utlets liii« those of mutton : ttie neck may be taken for both of tliet«. 



CHAP. XIU.3 GA3CB. 215' 

tion directed for in the receipt of page 102. Cut the venison in small 
thin slices of equal size, arraoj^e them in a clean saucepan, pour the 
gravy on them, let them stand ror ten minutes or more, then place them 
near the fire, and bring the whole very slowly to the point of boiling 
only : serve the hash immediately in a hot-wa^er dish. 

For a plain dinner, when no gravy is at hand, break down the bones 
of the venison small, after the flesh has been cleared from them, and 
boil them with those of three or four undressed mutton-cutlets, a slice 
or two of carrot, or a few savoijiry herbs, and about a pint and a half of 
water or broth, until the liquid is reduced quite one third. Strain it oS, 
let k cool, skim off all the fat, heat the gravy, thicken it when it boils 
with a dessertspoonful or rather more of arrow-root, or with the brown 
rouxof pa^ ^ mix the same sauce with it, and finish it exactly as 
the richer hash above. It may be served on sippets of fried bread or 
not, at choice. 

TO BOA£rr ▲ HARK. 

After the hare has been skinned, or cased, as it is called, wash it very 
thoroughly in cold water, and afterwards in warm. If in any degree 
overkept, or musty in the inside, which it will sometimes be when emp- 
tied before it is hung 
ap, and neglected after- 
wards, use vinegar, or 
the pyroligneous acid, 
well dilut^, to render 
it sweet; then again 
throw it into abundance 
of water, that it may 
retain no taste of the 
acid. Pierce with the 
point of a knife any 
parts in which the blood 
appears to have settled. Hare Dressed for Roasting, 

and soak them in tepid water, that it may be well drawn oat Wipe 
the hare 'dry, fill it with the forcemeat Na 1, page 122, sew it up, truss 
and spit it firmly, baste it for ten minutes with lukewarm water, mixed 
with a very little salt, throw this away, and put into the pan a quart or 
more of new milk ; keep it constantly laded over the hare, until it is 
nearly dried up, then add a large lump of butter, flour the hare, and 
continue the basting steadily until it is well browned ; for unless this be 
done, and the roast be kept at a proper distance from the fire, the out- 
side will become so dry and hard as to be quite uneatable. Serve the 
hare when done, with ^^ood brown gravy (of which a little shtMild be 
poured round it in the dish), and with fine red currant ielly. This is an 
approved English method of dressing it, but we would recommend in 
preference, that it should be basted plentifully with butter from the be- 
ginning (the strict economist may substitute clarified beefdripping, and 
finish with a small quantity of butter only) ; and that the salt and water 
should be altogether omitted. Firstrate cooks merely wipe the hare 
inside and out, and rub it with its own blood before it is laid to the fire ; 
but there is generally a rankness about it, especially after it has been 
many days killed, wnich, we should say, renders the washing indis- 
pensable, unless a coarse game-flavour be liked. 

Ik to 1^ hour. 




This, like a hare, ia much improved by having the back-bone token 
oat, and the directions we have given will enalue the cook, with very 
little practice, tu remove it witlMut difficult. Line the inside, when 
this ia done, with thin Blisea of bacon, fill it with tbrcemeat (No. 1, page 
IS3), sew it up, truss, and roast it at a clear, brisli lire, and baste it 
constantly with butter. Flour it well soon after it is laid down. Serve 
it with good brown eravy, and with currant jelly, when this last is 
liked. For chttnge, the back of the rabbit may be larded, and the bone 
Jell in, or not, at pleasore ; or it can be plain roasted when more con- 

j to I hour', less, if small. 

Rabbits that are three parts grown, or, at all events, whi«h are stffi 
qnite young, sliould be choaeu tot thia mode of cooking. Wash and

with bread sauce and game gravy (see preceding receipt), or with 
celery sauce. Our own mode of having them serveid is usually with 9i 
slice of fresh butter, about a tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and a good 
sprinkling of cayenne placed in a very hot dish, under them.

PARTRIDGES WITH MUSHROOMS. 

For a brace of young well-kept birds, prepare from half to three quRr« 
ters of a pint of mushroom-buttons, or very small flaps, as for pickling^ 
Dissolve over a gentle fire an ounce and a half of butter, throw in the 
mushrooms with a slight sprinkling of salt and cayenne, simmer them 
from eight to ten minutes, and turn them, with the butter, on to a plate; 
when they are quite cold, put the whole into the bodies of the partridges, 
sew them up, truss them securely, and roast them on a vertical lack 
with the heads downwards ; or should an ordinary spit be used, tie them 
firmly to it, instead of passing it through them. Roast them the usual 
time, and serve them with brown mushroom-sauce, or with gravy and 
bread sauce only. The birds may be trussed like boiled fowk, floured, 
and lightly browned in butter; half covered with rich brown mvyand 
stewed slowly for thirty minutes ; then turned, and simmered for ano- 
ther half hour with the addition of some mushrooms to the gravy ; or

BROILED parihidoe; {Bredkfost disk,') 

■' Split a young and well-kept partridge, and wipe it with a soft clean 
cloth inside and out, but do not wash it ; broil it delicately over a very 
clear fire, sprinkling it with a little salt and cayenne ; rub a bit of fresh 
butter over it the moment it is taken from the fire, and send it quickly 
to table with a sauce made of a good slice of butter browned with flour, 
a little water, cayenne, salt, and mushroom-catsup, poured over it** 
We give this receipt exactly as we received it from a house where we 
know it to have been greatly approved by various guests who have par- 
taken of it there. 

broiled partridge : (French Receipt,) 

Afler having prepared the bird with great nicety, divided, and flat- 
tened it, season it with salt, and pepper, or cayenne, dip it into clarified 
butter, and then into very fine bread-crumbs, and take care that every 
part shall be equally covered : if wanted of particularly good appear- 
ance, dip it a second time into the butter and crumbs. Place it over a 
very clear fire, and broil it gently from twenty to thirty minutes. Send 
it to table with brown mushroom sauce, or some Espagnole. 

[to roast wild pigeons. 

Pigeons, when stuffed, require seme green parsley to be chopped very 
fine with the liver and a bit of butter, seasoned with a little pepper and 
salt ; or they may be stufl^ed with the same as a fillet of veaL Fill the 
belly of each bird with either of these compositions. They will roast in 
about twenty or thirty minutes. Serve with parsley and butter, with a 
dish under them, with some in a boat Garnish with crisp parsley, 
fried bread crumbs, bread sauce or gravy. 

to roast small birds. 
The most delicate of these are larks, which are in high season in 
November and December. When cleaned and prepared for roasting, 
brush them with the yolk of an egg, and roll in bread crumbs; spit 
them on a lark-spit, and tie that on a larger spit ; ten or fifleen minutes 
at a quick fire will do them ; baste them with firesh butter, and sprinkle 
them with bread crumbs, till they are quite covered, while roasting. 
Sauce, grated bread fi-ied in butter, which set to drain before the fire 
that it may harden; serve the crumbs under the larks when you dish 
them, and garnish them with slices of lemon. Wheatears are dressed 
in the same way. 

REED BIRDS. 

Havinff carefiilly picked your birds, which should be very &t, draw 
them with the greatest care possible so sa not to rob them of any fiit^

tnd trass them on a skewer, which yoa fasten to the spit, and cook 
them before a brisk fire ; a very few minutes is requisite. In serving 
tbem, place them on buttered toast, and pour a small portion of gravy 
over them. Let them be hot This is generally considered the best 
manner of serving reed-birds, although many persons prefer them 
breaded and fried, or barbacued. When they are very fat it is unne- 
cessary to draw them. The season for this delicious bird is from tnu 
miikile of September to ^e first or second week in October.] 

Obs, — ^There are few occasions, we think, in which the contents of 
the dripping-pan can be introduced at table with advantage; but in 
dressing moor game, we would strongly recommend the toast to be laid 
in it under the birds, as it will afford a superior relish even to the birds 
themselves. 

A SALMI OF MOOS FOWL, PHEASANTS, OR PARTRIDGES. (eNTREE.) 

This is an ele^nt mode of serving the remains of roasted game, but 
'when a superlative salmi is desired, the birds must be scarcely more 
than half roasted for it In either case, carve them very neatly, and 
strip every particle of skin and &t from the le^ wings, and breasts ; 
bruise the bodies well, and put them with the skm, and other trimmings, 
into a very clean stew-pan. If for a simple and inexpensive dinner, 
merely add to them two or three sliced eschalots, a bay-leaf^ a small 
bkde of mace, and a few peppercorns ; then pour in a pint, or rather 
more, of good veal gravy, or strong broth. End boil it briskly until 
reduced nearly half; strain the gravv, pressing the bones well, to obtain 
all the flavour, skim off the fat, add a little cayenne, and lemon-juice, 
heat the game very gradually, in it, but do not, on any account, allow 
it to boil ; place sippets of fried bread round a dish, arrange the birds in 
good form in the centre, give the sauce a boil, and pour it on them. 
This is but a homely sort of salmi, though of excellent flavour if well 
made ; it may require perhaps the addition of a little thickening, and 
two or three glasses of dry white wine poured to the bodies of the birds, 
wiUi the broUi, would brmg it nearer to the fVench salmi in flavour. 
As the spongy substance in the inside of moor fowl and black game is 
apt to be extremely bitter, when they have been long kept, tare should 
be taken to remove such parts as would endanger the preparation. 

[to roast CAMYASa-BAOK DUCKS. 

Let your dock be young and fiit, if possible ; having picked it well, 
draw it and singe carefulhr, without washing it, so as to preserve the 
bloody and consequently, all its flavour. You then truss it, leaving its 
head on for the purpose of distinguishing it from common game, and 
place it on the spit before a brisk fire, for at least fifteen minutes. Then 
serve it hot, in its own gravjr, on a large chafing-dish. The best birds 
are found on the Potomac River ; they have the head purple, and the 
breast silver colonr, and it is considered superior in quality and flavour 
to any other species of wild duck. The season is only during the cold 
weather.] 

TO ROAST WILD DITCKS. 

These are prepared for the spit exactly like the tame ones, with the 
exception of the stufling, which is never used for wild fowl. A bit of 
0oft bread soaked in port wine, or in claret, is sometimes put into them.

when first laid down, turned briskly, and basted with butter almost 
without cessation. If drawn from the spit in from twenty-five to thirty 
minutes, then dished and laid before the fire tor two or three more, it 
will give forth a singularly rich gravy. Score the breast when it is

CHAPTER XIV. 

CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &c. 

Tnis great superiority of the oriental curries over those generally 
prepared in Europe or America, is not, we believe, altogether the result 
of a want of skill or of experience on the part of our cooks, but is 
attributable, in some measure, to many of the ingredients, which in a 
Jiresk and green state add so much to their excellence, being here 
beyond our reach. 

The natives of the East compound and vary this class of dishes, we 
are told, with infinite ingenuity, blending in them very agreeably many 
condiments of different flavour, until the highest degree of piquancy 
and savour is produced, the whole being tempered with fine vegetable 
acids. With us, turmeric and cayenne pepper prevail in them often far 
too powerfully: the prodigal use of the former should be especially 
avoided, as it injures both the quality and the colour of the currie, 
which ought to be of a dark green, rather than of a red or yellow hue. 
The first is given by the genuine powder imported from India ; the 
others, by the greater number of spurious ones, sold in England and 
America under its name. A couple of ounces of a sweet, sound cocoa- 
nut, lightly grated and stewed for nearly or quite an hour in the gravy 
of a currie, is a ffreat improvement to its flavour : it will be found par* 
iicularly agreeame with that of sweetbreads, and may be served in the 
currie, or strained from it at pleasure. Great care, however, should be 
taken not to use, for the purpose, a nut that is rancid. Spinage, cu- 
cumbers, ve^table marrow, tomatas, acid apples, green ^xjeeberries 
(seeded), and tamarinds imported in the shell--^ot preserv^ — may all, 
in their season, be added with very good effect to curries of different 
kinds. Potatoes and celery are also occasionally boiled down in them. 

The rice for a currie should always be sent to table in a separate 
dish from it, and, in serving them, it should be first helped, and the cur- 
rie laid upon it. 

Ha. ARNOTT's CVIUIIE-POWDBB. 

Turmeric, eight ounces.* 
Coriander seed, four ounces. 
Cummin seed, two ounces. 
Fcenugreek seed, two ounces. 
Cayenne, half an ounce. (More or less of this 
last to the taste.) 

* We think it would be an improyement to diminish by two oudgm the proportio« 
«f turmeric, and to increaie that of the coriander seed; but we have not tried it.

MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP XIT. 

Let the seeds be of the finest quality. Dry them well, poand, and 
sift them separately through a lawn sieve, then weigh, and mix them 
in the above proportions. This is an exceedingly agreeable and aro- 
matic powder, when all the ingredients are perfectly fresh and good ; 
but the preparing it is rather a troublesome process. Mr. Arnott re- 
commends that when it is considered so, a "high-caste'* chemist should 
be applied to for it. 

MR. ARNOTT's CURRIE. 

''Take the heart of a cabbage, and nothing but the heart, that is to 
■ay, pull away all the outside leaves until it is about the size of an egg ; 
chop it fine, add to it a couple of apples sliced thin, the juice of one 
lemon, half a teaspoonfiil of black pepper, with one large tablespoonful 
of my currie-powder, and mix the whole well together. Now take six 
onions that have been chopped fine and fried brown, a garlic head, the 
size of a nutmeg, also minced fine, two ounces of fresh butter, two table* 
spoonsful of flour, and one pint of strong mutton or beef gravy ; and 
when these articles are boiling, add the former ingredients, and let the 
whole be well stewed up together: if not hot enough, add cayenne 
pepper. Next, put in a fowl that has been roasted and nicely cut up; 
or a rabbit ; or some lean chops of pork or mutton ; or a lobster, or the 
remains of yesterday's calf's head; or any thing else you may fancy, 
and you will have an excellent currie, fit far kings to partake of." 

'* Well ! now for the rice ! It should be put into water which should 
be frequently changed, and should remain in for half an hour at least ; 
this both clears and soaks it Have your saucepan full of water (the 
larger the better,) and when it boils rapidly, throw the rice into it: it 
wifi be done in fifteen minutes. Strain it into a dish, wipe the sauce- 
pan dry, return the drained rice into it, and put it over a gentle fire for 
a few minutes, with a cloth over it: every grain will be separate. 
When served, do not cover the dish." 

Ob$. — ^We have already given testimony to the excellence of Mr. 
Amott's currie-powder, but we think the currie itself will be found 
somewhat too acid for English or American taste in general, and the 
proportion of onion and garlic by one half too much for any but well- 
seasoned Anglo-Indian palates. After having tried his method of boil- 
ing the rice, we still give the preference to that of page 54, Chapter L 

A BENGAL CURRIE. 

Slice and fry three large onions in two ounces of butter, and lift them 
out of the pan when done. Put into a stewpan three other large onions 
and a small clove of garlic which have been pounded together, and 
smoothlv mixed with a dessertspoonful of the best pale turmeric, a tea- 
spoonful of powdere4 ginger, one of salt, and one of cayenne pepper ; 
add to these the butter in which the onions were fried, and half a cup- 
ful of good gravy ; let them stew for about ten minutes, taking care 
that they shall not burn, f^^xt, stir to tliem the fried onions and half 
a pint more^of gravy ; add a pound and a half of mutton, or of any 
other ipe^t| free Iq'pm bone and &t, and simmer it gently for an houi, or

▲ COMMON INDIAN CVRaiB. 

For each pound of meat, whether veal, mutton, or beef, take a heaped 
tablespoonful of good cnrrie powder, a small teaspoonful of salt, and one 
of flour ; mix these well together, and after havmg cut down the meat 
into thick small cutlets, or squares, rub half of the mixed powder equallr 
over it Next, fry gently from one to four or five large onions sliced, 
with or without the addition of a small clove of garlic, or half a dozen 
eschalots, according to the taste ; and when they are of a fine ^Iden 
brown, lift them out with a slice and lay them upon a sieve to drain ; 
throw a little more butter into the pan and fry the meat lightly in it ; 
drain it w<!irl from the fat in taking it out, and lay it into a clean stewpan 
or saucepan ; strew the onion over it, and pour in as much boiling water 
as will almost cover it. Mix the remainder of the currie-powder 
smoothly with a little broth or cold water, and after the currie has 
stewed for a few minutes pour it in, shaking the pan well round that it 
may be smoothly blended with the gravy. Simmer the whole very 
softly until the meat is perfectly tender : this will be in from an hour 
and a quarter, to two hours and a hali; according to the quantity and the 
nature of the meat. Mutton will be the soonest done ; the brisket end 
(gristles) of a breast of veal will require twice as much stewing, and 
sometimes more. A fowl will be ready to serve in an hour. An acid 
apple or two, or any of the vegetables which we have enumerated at 
the commencement of this chapter, may be added to the currie, proper 
time being allowed for cooking each variety. Very young green peas 
are liked by some people in it ; and cucumbers pared, seeded, and cut 
moderately small, are always a good addition. A richer currie will of 
course be produced if gravy or broth be substituted for the water : either 
should be boiling when poured to the meat Lemon-juice should be 
stirred in before it is served, when there is no other acid in the currie. 
A dish of boiled rice must be sent to table with it A couple of pounds 
of meat free from bone, is sufficient quite for a moderate-sized dish of 
this kind, but those of the breast of veal are sometimes used for it, 
when it is to be served to a large iamily-party of currie-eaters : frooi 
half to a whole pound of rice should then accompany it For the pro- 
per mode of boiling it, see mullagatawny soup. Chapter I. The small 
grained, or Patna, is the kind which ought to be used for the purpose. 
Six ounces is quite sufficient for a not large currie ; and a pound, when 
boiled, and heated lightly in a dish, appears an enormous quantity for a 
modern table. 

To each pound of meat, whether veal, mutton, or beef^ 1 heaped 
tablespoonful of good currie-powder, 1 small teaspoonful of salt, and a 
lar^e one of flour, to be well mixed, and half rubbed on to the meat 
before it is fried, the rest added afterwards ; onions fried, from 1 to 4 or 
5 (with or without the addition of a clove of garlic, or half a dozen 
eschalots) ; sufficient boiling water to nearly cover the meat ; vegeta* 
bles, as in receipt, at choice; stewed, 1^ to 2^ hours* a fowl, 1 hour, or 
rather less; beef, 2 lbs., 1^ hour, or more; veal gristles, 2^ to 3 hours. 
Obs, — ^Rabbits make a very good currie when quite young. Cayenne 
pepper can always be added to heighten the pungency of a currie when 
the proportion in the powder is not considered sufficient

ssuk's cvrrteb, (Capimn Whitens.) 

These curries are made with a soft of paste, which is labelled with 
tlie above names, and as it has attracted some attention of late, and the 
curries made with it are very good, and quickly and easily prepared, we 
give the directions for them. ** Cut a pound and a half of chicken, 
i)wl, veal, rabbit, or mutton, into pieces an inch and a half sqiuire. Put 
from two to three ounces of fresh butter in a stewpan, and when it is 
melted put in the meat, and give it a good stir with a wooden spoon ; 
add from two to three dessertspoonsful of the currie-paste ; mix the 
whole up well together, and continue the stirring over a brisk fire from 
five to ten minutes, and the currie will be done. This is a dry currie. 
For a gravy currie, add two or three tablespoonsful of boiling water 
after the paste is well mixed in, and continue the stewing and stirring 
from ten to twelve minutes longer, keeping the sauce of me consistency 
of cream. Prepare salmon and lobster in the same way, but very 
quickly, that they may come up firm. The paste may be rubbed over 
steaks, or cutlets, when they are nearly broiled ; three or four minutes 
will finish them."* 

CURRIED BOOS. 

Boil six or eight fresh eggs quite hard, as for salad, and put them 
aside until they are cold. Mix well together from two to three ounces 
of good butter, and from three to four dessertspoonsful of currie-powder; 
shake them in a stewpan, or thick saucepan, over a clear but moderate 
fire for some minutes, then throw in a couple of mild onions finely 
minced, and fry them gently until they are tolerably soft; pour to them 
by degrees from half to three quarters of a pint of broth or gravy, 
and stew them slowly until they are reduced to pulp ; mix smoothly a 
small cup of thick cream with two teaspoonsful of wheaten or of rice- 
fiour, stir diem to the cjirrie, and simmer the whole until the raw taste 
of the thickening is gone. Cut the eggs into half inch slices, heat 
them quite through in the sauce without £)iling them, and serve them 
SB hot as possible. 

CI7RRIED SWEBTBREADS. 

Wash and soak them as usual, then throw them into boiling water 
with a little salt in it, and a whole onion, and let them simmer for ten 
minutes; or„ if at hand, substitute weak veal broth for the water. Lift 
them out, place them on a drainer, and leave them until they are per* 
fectly cold ; then cut them into half-inch slices, and either fiour and 
fry them lightly in butter, or put them, without this, into as much cur- 
ried gravy as will just cover them ; stew them in it very gently fit>m 
twenty to thirty mmutes; add as much lemon-juice or Chili vinegar as 
will acidulate the sauce agreeably,! and serve the currie very hc^ As 
we have already stated in two or three previous receipts, an ounce or 
more of sweet freshly-grated cocoa-nut, stewed tender in the gravy, 
and strained from it berore the sweetbreads are added, will give a pecu- 
liarly pleasant flavour to all curries. 

* UnlKss the meat be extrtuuly tender, and cut small, it will require from ten to 
fifteen minutes stewing: when no liquid is added, it must be stirred without intermis> 
sion, or the paste will burn to the pan. It answers weU for cutlets, and for mullaga* 
tawny soup also; but makes a very mild currie. 

t We find that a small portion of Indian pickled mango, or of its liquor, is an agree 
able addition to a currie, as well as to muUagatawny soup.

add a bit more butter, and two or three tablespoonsful of currie-powder. 
When these ingredients are well mixed over the fire with a wooden 
spoon, add gradually either hot water, or broth from the stock-pot; 
cover the stewpan, and let the whole boil up. Meanwhile, have ready 
the meat of a cocoa-nut, grated or rasped fine, put this into the stew-- 
pan with a few sour tamarinds (if they are to be obtained, if not, a sour 
apple, chopped.) Let the whole simmer over tlie fire until the apple is 
dissolved, and the cocoa-nut very tender ; then add a cupful of strong 
thickening made of flour and water, and sufficient salt, as a currie wiU 
not bear being salted at table. Let this boil up for five minutea Have 
ready also, a vegetable marrow, or part of one, cut into bits, and suffi- 
ciently boiled to require little or no fiirther cooking. Put this in with 
a tomata or two; either of these vegetables may be omitted. Now put 
into the stewpan the oysters with their liquor, and the milk of the 
cocoa-nut ; stir them well with the former ingredients ; let the currie 
stew gently for a few minutes, then throw in Sie strained juice of half 
a lemon. Stir the currie from time to time with a wooden spoon, and 
as soon as the oysters are done enough serve it up with a corresponding 
dish of rice on the opposite side of the table. The dish is considered at 
Madras the ne plus ultra of Indian cookery."* 

We have extracted this receipt, as it stands, from the Magazine of 
Domestic Economy, the season in which we have met with it not per- 
mitting us to have it tested. Such of our readers as mav have partaken 
of the true Oriental preparation, will be able to judge of its correctness; 
and oUiers may consider it worthy of a trial. We should suppose it 
necessary to b^rd the oysters. 

CURRIED ORAVT. 

The quantity of onion, eschalot, or garlic used fur a currie should be 
regulated by the taste of the persons for whom it is prepared ; the very 
large proportions of them which are acceptable to some eaters, prevent- 
ing others altogether from partaking of the dish. Slice, and fry gently 
in a little good butter, from a couple to six large onions (with a hit of 
garlic, and four or five eschalots, or none of either), when they are 
coloured equally of a fine yellow-brown, lift them on to a sieve reversed 
to drain ; put them into a clean saucepan, add a pint and a half of good 
gravy, with a couple of ounces of rasped cocoa-nut, or of any other of 
the condiments we have already specified, which may require as much 
stewing as the onions (an apple or two, for instance), and simmer them 
soflly from half to three quarters of an hour, or until the onion is suffi- 
ciently, tender to be pressed through a strainer. We would recommend 
that for a delicate currie this should always be done ; for a common one 
it is not necessary ; and many persons prefer to have the whole of it

possibly be from theii* abounding much more than sweet cream in so hot 
a climate. 

POTTKD MEATS. 

Any tender and well-roasted meat, taken free of fat, skin, and sfristle, 
as well as from the dry outsides, will answer for potting admirably, bet- 
ter, indeed, than that which is generally baked for the purpose, and 
which is usually quite deprived of its juices by the process. Spiced or 
corned beef also is excellent when thus prepared ; and any of these will 
remain good a loug time if mixed with cold fresh butter, instead of that 
which is clarified ; but no addition that can be made to it will render 
the meat eatable, unless it be thoroughly pounded; reduced, in fact, to 
the smoothest possible paste, free from a smfi^le lump or a morsel of un- 
broken fibre. If rent into fiagments, instead of being cut quite through 
the grain, in being minced, before it is put into the mortar, no beating 
will bring it to the proper state. Unless it be very dry, it is better to 
pound it for some time before any butter is added, and it must be long 
and patiently beaten after all the ingredients are mixed, that the whole 
may be equally blended and well mellowed in flavour. 

The quantity of butter required will depend upon the nature of the 
meat ; ham and salted beef will need a larger proportion than roast 
meat, or than the breasts of poultry and game ; white fish, from being 
less dry, will require comparatively little. Salmon, lobsters, prawns, 
and shrimps are all extremely good, prepared in this way. They should, 
however, be perfectly fresh when they are pounded, and be set imme- 
diately afterwards into a very cool place. For these, and for white 
meats in general, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne or white pepper, are the 
appropriate spices. A small quantity of cloves may be added to hare 
and other brown meat, but allspice we would not recommend unless the 
taste is known to be in favour of it The following receipt for pounding 
ham will serve as a general one for the particular manner of proceeding. 

POTTBD ram; (an excellent Receipt.) 

To be eaten in perfection this should be made with a freshly cured 
ham, which, after having been soaked for twelve hours, should be wiped 

* This must be added only Just before the currie is dished, when any meid fruit bat 
been boiled in the gravy ; it may then b« .finrt. Mended witli a su.aU purtion of arrow*

dry, nibeljr trimmed, closely vnmpped in cotrae paste, and baked verr 
tender.* When it comes frcHn the o?en, remove the crust and rind, 
and when the ham is perfectly coj^, take for each pound of the lean, 
which should be weighed after every morsel of skin and fibre has been 
carefully removed, six ounces of cold roast veal, prepared with equal 
nicety. Mince these quite fine with an exceedingly raarp knife, taking 
care to cut through the meat, and not to tear the fibre, as on this much 
of the excellence of the prepiuation depends. Next put it into a large 
stone or marble mortar, and pound it to the smoothest paste with eight 
ounces of fresh butter, which must be added by degrees. When three- 
parts beaten, strew over it a teaspoonful of freshly-pounded mace, half a 
large, or the whole of a small nutmeg grated, and the third of a tea- 
spoonful of cayenne well mixed together. It is better to limit the spice 
to this quantity in the first instance, and to increase afterwards either 
of the three kinds to tlie taste of the parties to whom the meat is to be 
served.f We do not find half a teaspoonful of cayenne and nearly two 
teaspocHisful of mace, more than is generally approved. After the spice 
is added, keep the meat often turuM from the sides to the middle of^the 
mortar, that it may be seasoned equally in every part When perfectly 
pounded, press it into small potting-pans, and pour clarified butter| over 
the top. If kept in a cool and dry place, this meat will remain good for 
a fortnight, or more. 

Lean of ham, 1 lb. ; lean of roast veal, 6 ozs. ; fresh butter, 8 obb. ; 
mace, from 1 to 2 teaspoonsful ; \ largei nutmeg ; cayenne, i to ^ tea- 
spoonful. 

Obs, — ^The roast veal is ordered in this receipt because the ham alone 
is generally too salt ; for the same reason butter, firesh taken from the 
churn, or that which is but slightly salted and quite new, should be used 
for it in preference to its own §it. When there is no ready-dressed veal 
in the house, the best part of the neck, roasted or stewed, will supply 
the requisite quantity. The remains of a cold boiled ham will answer 
quite well for potting, even when a little dry. 

POTTED CHICKEN^ PARTBIDOE, OB PHEASANT. 

Roast the birds as fi>r taUe, but let them be thoroughly done, for if 
the gravy be left in, the meat will not keep half so well. Raise the 
flesh of the breast, wings, and merrythought quite clear from the boiies, 
take ofiT the skin, mince, and then pound it very smoothly with about 
one third of its weight of fresh butter, or something less, if the meat 
should appear of a proper consistence without the full quantity ; season 
it with salt, mace^ and cayenne only, and add these in small portions 
until the meat is rather highly flavoured with both the last : proceed 
with it as with other potted meats. 

, POTTED OX-TONGUE. 

Boil tender an unsmoked tongue of good flavour, and the following 
day cut from it the quantity desired for potting, or take for this purpose

always necessary in asing it.

the remains of one which has already been served at table. Trim off 
the skin and rind, weigh the meat, mince it very small, then pound it 
as fine as possible with four ounces of butter to each pound of tongue, a 
small teaspoonful of mace, half as much of nutmeg and cloves, and a 
tolerably high seasoning of cayenne. After the spices are well beaten 
with the meat, taste it, ahd add more if required. A few ounces of any 
well^oasted meat mixed with the tongue will give it firmness, in which 
it is apt to be deficient -The breasts of turkeys, fowls, partridges, or 
pheasants may be used for the purpose with good efil^t. 

Tongue, 1 lb. ; butter, 4 ozs. ; mace, 1 teaspoonful ; nutmeg and 
cJbves, each ^ teaspoonful ; cayenne, 5 to 10 grains. 

LOBSTER BUTTER. 

Pound to the smoothest paste the coral of one or two fine lobsters, 
mix with it about a third of its volume of fi*esh butter, and the eame 
proportion of spices as are given in the preceding receipt Let the 
whole be thoroughly blended ; set it by for a while m a cool place and 
pot it, or make it up into small pats and serve them with curled parsley 
round the dish, or with any light foliage that will contrast well with 
their brilliant colour. The flesh of the lobster may be cut fine with a 
very sharp knife, and pounded with the coral. 

POTTED MUSHROOMS. 

The receipt for these, which we can recommend to the reader, will 
be found in the next Chapter. 



CHAPTER XV. 
VEGETABLES. 



The quality of vegetables depends much both on the soil in which 
they are grown, and on the degree of care bestowed upon their culture; 
but if prwluced in ever so great perfection, their excellence wilLbe en* 
tirely aestroyed if they be badly cooked. 

With the exception of artichokes, which are said to be improved by 
two or three days' keeping, all the summer varieties should be dressed 
before their first freshness has in any degree passed ofi^(for their flavour 
is never so fine as within a few hours of their being cut or gathered) ; 
but when this cannot be done, precaution should l^ taken to prevent 
their withering. The stalk-ends of asparagus, cucumbers, and vege 
table-marrow should be placed in from one to two inches of cold water 
and all other kinds should be spread on a cool brick floor. When th. 
has been neglected, they must be throvm into cold water for some time 
before they are boiled to recover them, though they will prove even 
then but very inferior eating. 

Vegetables, when not sufficiently cooked, are known to be so exceed- 
ingly unwholesome and indigestible, thai the custom of serving them 
cfisp, which means, in reality, only half-boiled, should be altogether 
disregarded when health is considered of more importance than fashi(Hi; 
but they should not be allowed to remain in the water aJfter they are 



CHAP. ZV.] VEGETABLC8. Stt 

qaite dcme, or both their nutritive properties and their Earoar will be 
lost, and their good appearance destro3Kd. Care should be taken to 
drain them thorouuhJy m a warm strainer, and to serve them very hot, 
with well-made sauces, if with any. 

Only dried peas or beans, Jerusalem artichokes, and potatoes, are put 
at first into cold water. All others require plenty of fast-boiling water, 
which should be ready salted and skimmed before they are thrown 
into it 

TO CUEAR TEOBTABLE8 FROM INBECTS. 

Lay them for half an hour or more into a pan of strong brine, with 
the stalk ends uppermost; this will destroy the small snails and other 
insects which cluster in the leaves, and they will fall' out and sink to 
the bottom. A pound and a half of salt to the gallon of water will an- 
swer for this purpose, and if strained daily it will last for some time. 

TO BOIL YEOETABLES OBEEN. 

After they have been properly prepared and washed, throw them into 
plenty of boiling water which has been salted and well skimmed ; and 
keep them uncovered and boiling fast until thev are done, taking evenr 
precaution against their being smoked. Should the water be very hard, 
a bit of soda the size of a hazel-nut, or a small half-teaspoonful of car- 
bonate of soda, may be added with the salt, for every two quarts, and 
will greatly improve the colour of the vegetables; but if used in uddue 
proportion, it v^ill injure them ; green peas especially will be quickly 
reduced to a mash if'^boiled with too large a quantity. 

Water, 1 gaNon ; salt, 2 ozs. ; soda, ^ to ^ oz. ; or carbonate of soda, 
1 teaspoonful. 

TO BOIL POTATOES ; (o genuine Irish Receipt,) 

Potatoes, to boil well together, should be all of the same sort, and as 
nearly equal in size as may be. Wash off the mould, and scrub them 
very clean with a hard brush, but neither scoop nor apply a knife to 
them in any way, even to clear the eyes.* Rinse them well, and arrange 
them compactly in a saucepan, so that they may not lie loose in the 
water, and that a small quantity may suffice to cover them. Pour this 
in cold, and when it boils, throw in about a large teaspoonful of salt to 
the quart, and simmer the potatoes until they are nearly done, but for 
the last two or three minutes let them boil rapidly. When tiiey are 
tender quite thrqjjgh, which may be known by probing them with a 
fork, pour all the \vater from them immediately,' lift the lid of the sauce- 
pan to allow the steam to escape, and place them on a trevet, high over 
the fire, or by the side of it, until the moisture has entirely evaporate^ 
then peel, and send them to table as quickly as possible, either in a hot 
napkin, or in a dish, of which the cover is so placed that the steam can 
pass off. There should be no delay in serving them after they are once 
taken from the fire : Irish families usually prefer them served in their 
skins. Some kinds will be done in twenty minutes, others in less than 
three quarters of an hour. We are informed that " the best potatoes 
are those which average from five to six to the pound, with few eyes^ 

* " Because,** in the words of oor dever Irish correspondent, " the water through 
these parts is then admitted into the very heart of the vegetable; and the latent heat, 
■fter coolcing, is not sufficient to throw it off: this renders the potatoes very un* 
wholesome.**

bat those pretty deep, and equally dietribiited iyver the sar&ce.^' We 
oonnot ourselves vouch for the correctness of the assertion, but we think 
it may be relied on. 

20 minutes to J hour or more. 

.0&«. — ^The water in which they are boiled should barely cover the 
potatoes. 

[AHOTHEK WAT TO BCUIi POTA.TOB8. 

Pare, wash and throw them into a pan of cold water; then put tiiem 
on to boil in a clean pot with cM water sufficient to cover them, and 
sprinkle over a little salt ; let them boil slowly uncovered till yoa can 
pass a fork through them ; pour off the water, and set them where they 
will keep hot tm wanted. When done in this way they are very 
mealy and dry. 

Potatoes either boiled or roasted, should jyner he covered to ke^ 
them hot] 

TO BOIL NEW POTATOES. 

These are never good unless freshly dug. Take them of equal size, 
and rub off the skins with a brush, or a very coarse cloth, wash them 
clean, and put them, without salt, into boiling, or at least, quite hot 
water; boil them softly, and when they are tender enough to serve, 
pour off the water entirely, strew some nne salt over the potatoes, give 
them a shake, and let them stand by the fire in the saucepan for a 
minute, then dish and serve them immediately. Some cooks throw in 
a small slice of fresh butter, with the salt, and toss them gently in it 
after it is dissolved. This is a ^ood mode, but the more usual one is to 
send melted butter to table with them, or to pour wnife sauce over 
them when they are very young, and served early in the season, as a 
side or corner dish. 

Very email, 10 to 15 minutes : moderate sized, 15 to 20 minutes. 

NEW POTATOES IN BXTTTER. 

Rub off the skins, wash the potatoes well, and wipe them dry; put 
them with three ounces of good butter, for a small dish, and with four 
ounces, or more, for a large one, into a well-tinned stewpan or ^ce- 
pan^ and simmer them over a gentle fire for about half an hour. Keep 
them well shaken or tossed, t^t they may be equally done, and throw 
in some salt when they begin to stew. This is a good mode of dress- 
ing them when they are very young and watery. 

TO BOIL potatoes; {Captain Rater's Receipt,) 

Wash, wipe, and pare the potatoes, cover them with cold water, and 
ftil them gently until they are done, pour off the water, and sprinkle 
a little fine salt over them ; then take each potato separately with a 
spoon, and lay it into a clean warm cloth, twist this so as to press all 
the mobture from the vegetable, and render it quite round; turn it 
carefully into a dish placed before the fire, throw a cloth over, and 
when all are done, send them to table quickly. Potatoes dressed in 
this way are mashed without the slighest trouble ; it is also by fiur the 
best method of jHreparing them for puddings or for cakes. 

TO ROAST OR BAKE POTATOES. 

Scrub, and wash exceedingly clean, some potatoes nearly assorted in 
size ; wipe them very dry, and roast them in a Dutch oven before the 



^ CHAP* Zir.3 TEOEYABLES. 231 

fire, piaciDg' them at a distance from it, and keeping them often turned; 
arrange tbem^ in a coarse dish, and bake them in a moderate oven. 
Dish them neatly in a napkin, and send them very hot to table ; serve 
cold butter with them. 
1| to upwards of 2 hours. 

SCOOPED Potatoes, (emtrembts) ; or second course dish. 

Wash and wipe some large potatoes of a firm kind, and with a small 
scoop adapted to the piurpose, form as many diminutive ones as will fill 
a dish ; cover them with cold water, and when they have boiled gently 
^ for five minutes, pour it ofi*, and put more cold water to them ; after they 
have simmered a second time for five minutes, drain the water quite 
away, and lei them steam by the side of the fire from four to five min- 
utes longer. Dish them carefully, pour white sauce over them, and 
serve them with the second course. Old potatoes thus prepared, have 
often been made to pass for new ones, at the best tables, at the season in 
which the fresh vegetable is dearest. The time required to boil thera 
will of course vary with their quality: we give the method which we 
have found very successful. 

• 

ntlED POTATOES. (ENTREMETS.) 

After having washed them, wipe and pare some raw potatoes, cut 
thorn in slices of equal thickness, or into thin shavings, and throw them 
into plenty of boiling butter, or very pure clarified drippinff. Fry thera 
of a fine light brown, and very crisp ; lift them out with a skimmer, 
drain thera on a soft warm cloth, dish them very hot, and sprinkle fine 
salt over them. This is an admirable way of dressing potatoes, very 
common on the Continent, but less so in England than it deserves to be. 
When pared XQund and round to a corkscrew form, in ribbons or shavings 
of equal width, and served dry and well fried, lightly piled in a dish, 
they make a handsome appearance and are excellent eating. We have 
known them served in this country with a slight sprinklinfif of cayenne. 
If sliced, they should be something less than a quarter-inch thick. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Boil them perfectly tender quite through, pour off the water, and 
steam them very dry by the directions already given in the^ receipt of 
page 229 ; peel them quickly, take out every speck, and while they are 
stiU hot press the potatoes through an earthen cullender, or bruise them 
to a smooth mash with a strong wooden fork or spoon, but never pound 
them in a mortar, as that will reduce them to a close heavy pe^te. ' Let 
them be entirely free from lumps, for nothing can be more indicative of 
carelessness or want of skill on the part of the cook, than mashed pota- 
toes sent to table full of these. Melt in a clean saucepan a slice of 
good butter with a few spoonsful of milk, or» better still, of cream ; put 
in the potatoes after having sprinkled some fine salt upon them, and stir 
the whole over a gentle fire, with a wooden spoon, until the ingredients 
are well mixed, and the whole is very hot. It may then te served 
directly ; or heaped high in a dish, left rough on the surlace, and browned 
" before the fire; or it may be pressed into a well-buttered mould of 
handsome form, which has been strewed with the finest bread-crumbs, 
and shaken firee of the loose ones, then turned out, and browned in a 



232 MODERN COOSBRY. [CHAP. XV. ^ 

Dutch or common oven. More or less liquid will be required to moisten 
sufHciently potatoes of various kind& 

PoUtoes mashed, 2 lbs.; salt, 1 tcaspoonfiil; butter, 1 to 2 ozs. ; milk 
or cream, ^ pint. 

Obs, — Mashed potatoes are often moulded with a cup, and then 
equally browned ; any other shape will answer the purpose as well, and 
many are of better appearance. 

ENGLISH POTATO-BALLS. 

Boil some floury potatoes very dry, mash them as smoothly as poasi- 
ble, season them well with salt and white pepper; warm them with 
about an ounce of butter to the pound, or rather more if it will not ren- 
der them too moist ; a few spoonsful of good cream may be added, but 
they must be boiled very dry after it is stirred to them. Let the mix- 
ture cool a little, roll it mto balls, sprinkle over them vermicelli crushed 
slightly with the hand, and fry them a fine light brown. They may be 
dished round a shape of plain mashed potatoes, or piled on a napkin by 
themselves. They may likewise be rolled in egg and fine bread-crumbs 
instead of in the vermicelli, or in rice-flour, which answers very well 
for them. 

POTATO BOULETTfiS. (eNTREMETS) ; (gOOd.) 

Boil some good potatoes as dry as possible, or let them be prepared by 
Captain Kater's receipt ; mash a pound of them very smoothly, and mix 
with them while they are still warm, two ounces of fresh butter, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a little nutmeg, the beaten and strained yolks of four 
eggs, and last of all the whites thoroughly whisked. Mould with, and 
drop tlie mixture from a teaspoon, into a small pan of boiling butter, or 
of very pure lard, and fry the boulettes for five minutes over a mode- 
rate fire : they should be of a fine pale brown, and very light. Drain 
them well iftid dish them on a hot napkin. 

Potatoes, 1 lb.; butter, 2 ozs.; salt, 1 teaspoonful; eggs, 4: 5 
minutes. 

POTATO rissoles; {French,) 

Mash and season the potatoes with salt, and white pepper, or cayenne, 
and mix with them plenty of minced parsley, and a small quantity of 
green onions, or eschalots ; add sufficient yolks of e^g to bind the mix- 
ture together, roll it into small balls, and fry them m plenty of lard or 
butter over* a^oderate fire, or they will be too much browned before 
they are done through. Ham, or any other kind of meat finely minced, 
may be substituted for the herbs; or added to them. 

POTATOES A LA MAITRE D*HOT£L. 

Boil in the usual manner some potatoes of a firm kind, peel, and let 
them cool ; then cut them equally into quarter-inch slices. Dissolve in 
a very clean stewpan or saucepan from two to four ounces of good but- 
ter, stir to it a small dessertspoonful of flour, and shake the pan over the 
fire for two or three minutes; add by slow degrees a small cup of boil- 
ing water, some pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful of minced parsley ; 
put in the potatoes, and toss them gently over a clear fire until they are 
quite hot, and the sauce adheres well to them ; at the instant of serving 
add a dessertspoonful of strained lemon-juice. Pale veal gravy may be 
substituted for the water; and the potatoes, after being Slickly sliced^ 
may be quickly cut of the same size with a small round cutter. 



GKiLP. Xy.3 VEeETABLX8« 283 

POTATOES A LA CREME. 

Prepare the potatoes as above, and toss them gently in a quarterpint 
or more of thick white sauce or of common bechamel, with or without 
the addition of the minced parsley. 

SPINACH, (entremets.) (^French Receipt,) 

Pick the spinach leaf by leaf from the stems, and wash it in aboo- 
dance of spring water, chan^ng it several times ; then shake it in a 
dry cloth held hy the four comers, or drain it on a large cieve. Throw 
it mto sufficient well-salted boiling water to allow it to float freely, and 
keep it pressed down witli a skimmer that it may be equally done. 
When quite young it will be tender in from eight to ten minutes, but to 
ascertain if it be so, take a leaf and squeeze it between the fingers. If 
to be dressed in the French mode, drain, and then throw it directly into 
plenty of fresh water, and when it is cool form it into balls and press 
the moisture thoroughly from it with the hands. Next, chop it ex- 
tremely fine upon a clean trencher; put two ounces (for a large dish) 
of butter into a stewpan or bright thick saucepan, lay the spinach on it, 
and keep it stirred over a gentle fire for ten minutes, or until it appears 
dry ; dredge in a spoonful of flour, and turn the spinach as itAs added ; 
pour to it gradually a few spoonsful of very rich veal gravy, or, if pre- 
ferred, of ffot}d boiling cream, (with the last of these a dessertspoonful 
or more of pounded sugar may be added for a second-course dish, when 
the true French mode of dressing the vegetable is liked.) Stew the 
whole briskly until the whole is well al^rbed; dish, and serve the 
spinach very hot, with small, pale fried sippets round it, or with leaves 
ef puff paste fresh from the oven, or well dried after having been fried. 
For ornament, the sippets may be fancifully shaped with a tin cutter. 
A proper seasoning of salt must not be omitted in this or any other pre- 
paration of the spinach. 

SPINACH ; (common English mode,) 

Boil the spinach very green in plenty of water, drain, and then press 
the moisture from it between two trenchers ; chop it small, put it into 
a clean saucepan, with a slice of fresh butter, and stir the whole until 
well [nixed and verv hot Smooth it in a dish, mark it in dice, and 
send it quickly to table. 

ANOTHER COMMON ENGLISH RECEIPT FOR SPINACH. 

Take it leaf by leaf from the stalks, and be very careful to clear it 
from any weeds that may be amongst it, and to free it by copious and 
repeated washings from every particle of grit Put it into a large well- 
tinned stewpan or saucepan, with the water only which hangs about it; 
throw in a small spoonful of salt a-nd keep it constantly pressed down 
with a wooden spoon, and turned often for about a quarter of an hour, 
or until it is perfectly tender. Drain off the superfluous moisture, chop 
the spinach quickly on a hot trencher ; dish and serve it immediately. 
Fried sippets of bread should always be served round this vegetable, 
unless it be prepared for an invalid. 

BOILED TURNIP-RADISHES. 

^ These should be freshly drawn, young and white. Wash and trim 
them neatly, leaving on two or three of the small inner leaves of the 
20* 



884 MODERN OOOKBRY. [CHAP. XV. 

top. Boil them in plenty of salted water from twenty to thirty minutes, 
and as soon as thev are tender send them to table well drained, with 
melted butter or wnite sauce. Common radishes, when young, tied in 
bunches, and boiled from eighteen to twenty-five minutes, then served 
ou a toast like asparagus, are very good. 

BOILED LEEKS. 

Trim off the coarser leaves from some young leeks, cut them into 
equal lengths, tie them into small bunches, and boil them in plenty of 
water which has been previously salted and skimmed ; serve them on a 
toast, and send melted butter to table with them. 

20 to 25 minutes. 

STEWED LETTUCES. 

Strip off the outer leaves, and cut away the stalks; wash the lettuces 
with exceeding nicety, and throw them into water salted as for all green 
vegetables. When they are quite tender, which will be in from twenty 
to thirty minutes, according to their age, lift them out, and press the 
water thoroughly from tliem ; chop them a little, and heat them in a 
clean saucepan with a seasoning of pepper and salt, and a small slice of 
butter ; l^n dredge in a little flour and stir them well ; add next a 
small cup of broth or gravy, boil them quickly until they are tolerably 
dry, then stir in a little pale vinegar or lemon-juice, and serve them as 
hot as possible, with fried sippets round them. 

TO BOIL ASPARAGUS. 

With a sharp knife scrape the stems of the asparagus lightly, but 
very clean, from within one to two inches of the green tender points, 
throw them into cold water as they are done, and when all are ready, 
tie them in bunches of equal size ; cut the large ends evenly, that the 
asparagus may be all of the same length, and put it into plenty of boil- 
ing water prepared by the directions of page 229. Cut a round of 
bread quite half an inch thick, and after having pared off the crust, 
toast it a delicate brown on both sides. When the stalks of the aspa- 
ragus are tender, lift it out directly, or it will lose both its colour and 
its flavour, and will also \fs liable to break ; dip the toast quickly into 
the water in which it was boiled, and dish the vegetable upon it, with 
the points meeting in the centre. Send rich melted butter to table 
with it In France, a small quantity of vinegar is stirred into the 
sauce before it is served ; and many persons like the addition. Aspa- 
ragus may be preserved for a day or two sufficiently fresh for use, by 
keeping the stalks immersed in an inch depth of cold water; but it is 
never so good as when dressed directly it is cut, or within a few hours 
after. 

20 to 25 minutes. 

Ohs. — Abroad, ix)iled asparagus is very frequently served cold, and 
eaten with oil and vinegar, or a sauce Mayonnaise. 

ASPARAGUS POINTS DRESSED LIKE PEAS. (ENTREMETS.) 

This is a convenient mode of dressing asparagus, when it is too small 
and green to make a good appearance plainly boiled. Cut the points 
so far only as they are perfectly tender, in bits of equal size, not more 
than the third of an inch in length ; wash them very clean, and throw 



ckAF. XV.3 VlbOBTABLSS. 2tt 

them into plenty of boiling water, with the usual quantity of salt and a 
morsel of soda. When they are tolerably tender, which will be in from 
ten to twelve minutes, drain them well, and spread them on a cleaa 
cloth ; fold it over them, wipe them gently, and when they are quite 
dry put them into a clean steWpan with a good slice of butter, whick 
should be just dissolved before the asparagus is added ; stew them ia 
this over a brisk fire, shaking them often, for eiefht or ten minutes; 
dredge in about a small teaspoonful of flour, and add half that quantity 
of white sugar ; then pour in boilin? water to nearly cover the aspara- 
gus, and boil it rapidly until but little liquid remains : stir in the beaten 
yolks of two eggs, heap the asparagus high in a dish, and serve it very 
not The sauce should adhere entirely to the vegetable, as in green 
peas d la Franqaise, 

TO BOIL OREEN PEAS. 

To be eaten in perfection these should be young, very freshly 
^thered, and shelled just before they are boiled ; should there be great 
mequality in their size, the smaller ones may be separated from the

when all are ready wash and drain them well, throw them into a large 
saucepan of fiist-boiling water, salted as usual (see page 229)« and when 
they are quite tender, which will be in from twelve to eighteen minutes, 
pour them into a cullender, shake the water from them, dish, and send 
quickly to table with good melted butter in a tureen. When from half 
to two parts grovin, cut the beans obliquely into a lozenge form, or, 
when a less modern fashion is preferred, split them len^wise into 
delicate strips, and then cut them once across : tlie strings should be 
drawn off with the tops and stalks. No mode of dressing it can render 
this vegetable good when it is old, but if the sides be pared o^ the 
beans cut thin, and boiled tender with rather more than the ordinary 
proportion of soda, they will be of excellent colour, and tolerab^ 
eatable.

TO BOIL WIND0OE BBAN8. 

When youDgr, freshly gathered, and well dressed, these heans, even 
with many persons accustomed to a luxurious table, are a favourite 
accompaniment to a dish of streaked bacon, or delicate pickled pork* 
Shell them only just before they are wanted, then wash, drain, and 
throw them into boiling water, salted as for pea& When they are 
quite tender, poor them into a hot cullender, drain them thoroughly, 
and send them to table quickly, with a tureen of parslev and butter, or 
with plain melted butter, when it is preferred. A boiled cheek of bacon, 
trimmed free of any blackened parts, may be dished over the beans, 
upon occasion. 

20 to 30 minutes ; less, when very young. 

Obt, — ^When the skin of the beans appears wrinkled, thev will gene* 
rally be found sufficiently tender to serve, but they should be tasted to 
ascertain that they are sa 

DRB8SXD CVCUMBEIUL 

Pare and slice them very thin, strew a little fine salt over them, and 
when they have stood a few minutes drain off the water, by raising one 
side of the dish, and letting it flow to the other ; pour it away, strew 
more salt, and a moderate seasonin? of pepper 'on them, add two or 
three tablespoonsful of the purest salad-oil, and turn the cucumbera well* 
that the whole may receive a portion of it; then pour over them from 
one to three dessertspoonsful of Chili vinegar, and a little common, 
should it be needed ; turn them into a clean dish and serve them. 

Obs, — If very young, cucumbers are usually dressed without beio^ 
pared, but the tough rind of full-grown ones bemg extremely indigesti- 
ble, should be avoided. The vegetable, though apt to disagree with 
persons of delicate habit, when sauced in the common mode, with 
salt, pepper, and vinegar onlv, may often be eaten by them with 
impunity when dressed with plenty of oil. It is difficult to obtain this 
perfectly fresh and pure here; and hence, perhaps, arises in part the 
prejudice, which amongst us, is so often found to exist against the use 
of this most wholesome condiment

served with any kind of roast meat 

ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR MANimAM. 

Take three or four cucumbers, so young as not to require paring ;

CUCUMBERS A LA FOULEITB, 

The cucumbers for this dish may be pared and sliced very thin; or 
quartered, freed from the seeds, and cut into balf-incb lengths; in either 
case they should be steeped in a little vine^r and sprinlded with salt 
for half an hour before they are dressed. Drain, and then press them 
dry in a soft cloth ; flour them well, put a slice of butter into a stew pan 
or saucepan bright in the inside, and when it begins to boil throw in the 
cucumbers, and shake them over a gentle fire ten minutes, but be care- 
ful to prevent their taking the slightest colour ; pour to them gradually 
as much strong, but very pale, veal stock or gravy as will nearly cover 
them; when it boils skim off the &t entirelj^* add salt and white pepper, 
if needed, and when the cucumbers are quite tender; strew in a large 
teaspoonfiil of finely-minced parsley, and thicken the sauce with the 
yplks of two or three eggs. French cooks add the flour when the vege- 
table has stewed in the butter, instead of dredging it upon them at fir&t, 
and this is perhaps the better method.

they will not brown ; when they are nearly done sprinkle some salt 
amongst them, and as soon as they are quite tender, lift them out 
with a slice, drain them well, and place tliem lightly over the hash 
or mince. A small portion of onion may be fried with them when it 
is liked. 

MELON. 

This in France and in other parts of the Continent is served and eaten

of salt and pepper only ; but the fruit is there fiir more abundant, and of 
infinitely finer growth than witli us, and requires so little care, compa- 
ratively, that it is planted in many places in the open fields, where it 
flourishes admirably. 



CHAP. XV.] TEGETABLXg, 389 



The herbs and v^etahles for a salad cannot he too freshly gathered ; 
they ahoold be carefully cleared from ioseets ajod washed with scrupu* 
lous nicety ; they are better whep not prepared until near the time of 
sending them to table, and should not be sauced until the instant before 
they are served. Tender lettuces, of which the outer leaves should be 
stripped away, mustapd and cress, young radishes, and occasionally 
chives or small green onions (when the taste of a party is in &vour ot 
these last) are the usual ingredients of summer salads. Half-grown 
encumbers sliced thin, and mixed with them, are a fiivourite addition 
with many persons. In England it is customary to cut the lettuces 
extremely fine ; the French, who object to the flavour of the knifes 
which they &.ncy this mode imparts, break them small instead. Young 
celery alone, sliced and dressed with a rich salad mixture (see page 103) 
is excellent : it is still in some fiimilies served thus always wim roast 
pheasants. 

Beet-root, baked or boiled, blanched endive, small salad-herbs which 
are easily raised at any time of the year, celery, and hardy lettuces, 
with any ready-dressed vegetable, will supply salads through the winter. 
Cucumber vinegar is an agreeable addition to these. 

FRENCH SAIiAD. 

In winter this is made principally of beautifiiUy-blanched endive, 
wajshed delicately clean and broken into small branches with the fingers, 
then taken from the water and shaken dry in a basket kept fiir the pur* 
pose, or in a fine cloth; then arranged in the 8alad4x)wt and strewed 
with herbs (tarragon generally, when in season) minced small: the 
dressing is not added until just before th^ salad is eaten. In summer;r 
young lettuces are substituted for the endive, and intermixed with a 
variety of herbs, some of which are not generally cultivated in England. 

8T7FTOLK SALAD. 

Fill a saladf-bowl from half to three parts full with very tender let- 
tuces shred small, minced lean of ham, and hard-boiled egss, or their 
yolks only, also minced, placed in alternate layers ; dress 5ie mixture 
with English salad-saupe, but do not pour it into the bowl until the in- 
stant of serving. A portion of cold chicken, cut in thin slices about the 
size of a shilling, may be added when convenient. 

TORKSHIRE FIiOUOHMAN*8 SALAD. 

Mix treacle and vinegar, in the proportion of one tablespoonful of the 
first to two of the latter ; add a little black pepper, and eat the sauce 
with lettuces shred small (with an intermixture of joung onions when 
they are liked.) This, though certainly not a very reined order of 
mlad, is scarcely so unpalatable as such ingredients would seem to 
promise. 

TO BOIL OAULniiOWKnS. 

Trim off the outside leaves, and cut the stems quite close to thecauli- 
flowers ; let them lie for an hour in plenty of cold water, with a hand- 
ful of salt in it, to draw out any insects that may be amongst them ; 
then wash them very tlioroughly, and examine them well, to be assured 
diat no snail is left in any part of them, throw them into a large pan of 



240 KODEBN COOKERir. [cHAP. XV. 

boilinj^ water, salted as for asparagus, and quite cleared from scum ; for 
this, if not removed, will adhere to the cauliflowers and spoil their 
appearance. When the ^Iks are tender lift them out, dish them 
neatly, and send good melted butter t^ table with them. 
20 to 30 minutes. 

CA.ULIFLOWEIU9. {French Receipt.) 

Cut the cauliflowers into small handsome tufts, and boil them until 
three parts done, drain ^hem well, toss them for a moment in some thick 
meltea butter or white sauce, and set them by to cool. When they are 
quite cold, dip them separately into the batter of page 130, fry them a 
light brown, arrange them neatly in a dish, and serve them very hot 

BROGOOU. 

This is boiled, and served in the same manner as cauliflowers when 
the heads are large ; the stems of the branching broccoli are peeled, and 
the vegetable, ti^ in bunches, is dressed and served, like asparagus, 
upon a toast 

10 to 20 mmutes. 

TO BOIL ARTICHOKES. 

After they have been soaked and well washed, cut ofl'the stems qaite 
close, trim away a few of the lower leaves, and clip the points of all ; 
throw the artichokes into pl6ntv of fast boiling water, ready salted and 
skimmed, with the addition, if'^it be at hand, of the proportion of soda 
directed in page 229, as this will greatly improve the colour of the 
vegetable. When extremely young, the artichokes will be tender m 
from half to three quarters of an hour, but they will require more than 
double that time when at their full growth : when the leaves can be 
drawn out easily, they are done. Send good melted butter to table with 
them. They should be boiled always with the stalk-ends uppermost 

Very young, ^ to j hour ; full grown, 1^ to 2 hours. 

Obs, — French cooks lift the tops from the artichokes before they are 
served, and replace them after having taken out the chokes : this must 
be expeditiously done to prevent the vegetable from cooling. 

[to boil winter 8QVA8H. 

Squash is a rich vegetable, particularly the yellow winter squash. 
This requires more boiling than the summer kind. Pare it, cut in 
pieces, take out the seeds and boil it in a very little water till it is quite 
soft Then press out all the water, mash it and add a little butter, pep- 
per and salt] 

VEGETABLE MARROW. 

It is customary to gather this when not larger than a turkey^s effg, 
but we should say that the vegetable is not then in its perfection. The 
flesh is whiter and of better flavour when the gourd is about six inches 
long ; at least we have found it so with the kinds which have fallen 
under our observation. It may either be boiled in the skin, then pared, 
halved, and served upon a toast; or quartered, freed from the seed, and 
left until cold, then dipped into egg and fine crumbs of bread, and fried; 
or it may be cut into dice, and reheated in a little good white sauce; or 
stewed tender in butter, and served in well-thickened veal gravy, fla- 
voured with a little lemon-juice. It may likewise be mashed by the

receipt which we have ^iven for turnips, and in that form will be found 
exceUent The French make a fancifiil dish of the marrows thus: they 
boil them tender in water, and halve them lengthwise as is usual, tbey 
then slice a small bit off each to make them stand evenly in the dish* 
and after having hollowed the insides, so as to leave a mere shell, about 
half an inch thick, they fill them with a thick rich mince of white meat, 
and pour white sauce roimd them ; or they heap fried crumbs over the 
tops, place the dish in the oven for a few minutes, and serve them with- 
out sauce. 

Size of turkey's egg, 10 to 15 minutes; moderate-sized, 20 to 90; 
large, | to 1 hour. 

TOUATAS EN SALADE. 

These are now often served in England in the American fiishion, 
merely sliced, and dressed like cucumbers, with salt, pepper, oil, and 
vinegar. For various other American modes of preparing them for 
table, see tomata dumplings, Chapter XVIL 

ROAST TOMATAS. To Bcrvc wUh foost Ug^ loitt, w shoiUder oftntUUnu 

Select them nearly of the same size, take off the stalks, and roast 
them gently in a Dutch oven, or if more convenient, place them at the 
edge of the dripping-pan, taking care that no fat from the joint shall fiill 
upon them, and keeping them turned that they may be equally done, 
from ten to fourteen mmutes will roast them. 

8TEWED TOXATAS. 

Arrange them jn a single layer, and pour to them as much gravy as 
will reach to half their height ; stew them very softly until the under 
sides are done, then turn, and finish stewing them. Thicken the gravy 
with a little arrow-root and cream, or with flour and butter, and serve 
it round them. 

FORCED TOMATAS ; {English Receipt) 

Cut the stems quite close, slice off the tops of eight fine tomatas, and 
scoop out the insides ; press the pulp through a sieve, and mix with it 
one ounce of fine crumbs of bread, one of butter, broken very small* 
some pepper, or cayenne, and salt Fill the tomatas with the mixture, 
and bake them ten minutes in a moderate oven; serve them with brown 
^ravy in the dish. A few small mushrooms, stewed tender in a little 
biitter, then minced and added to the tomata pulp, wiU very much im- 
prove this receipt 

Baked 10 minutes. 

FORCED TOMATAS ; {French Receipt.) 

Let the tomatas be well shaped and of equal size; divide them nearly 
in the middle, leaving the blossom-side the largest, as this onlv is to be 
used ; empty them carefully of their seeds and juice, and fijl them with 
the following ingredients, which must previously be stewed tender in 
batter, but without being allowed to brown : minced mushrooms and 
shalots, with a moderate proportion of parsle v, some lean of ham chopped 
small, a seasoning of cayenne, and a little nne salt, if needed ; let them 
cool, then mix with them about a third as much of fine crumbs of bread, 
and two yolks of egss ; fill the tomatas, cover them with fine crumbs, 
moisten them with clarified butter, and bake them in a brisk oven until 
21 



242 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAF. XT. 

they are well coloured. Serve them as a garnish to stewed rump or 
sirloin of beef, or to a boned and forced leg of mutton. 

Minced lean of ham, 2 ozs. ; mushrooms, 2 ozs.; bread-crumbs, 2 
ozs. ; shalots, 4 to 8 ; parsley, full teaspooqfu) ; cayenne, quarter salt* 
spoonflil ; little salt, if needed ; butter, 2 ozs. ; yolks of eggs, 2 to 3 : 
baked, 10 to 20 minutes. 

Obs. — ^The French pound the whole of these ingredients with a bit 
of garlic, before they fill the tomatas with them, but this is not abso- 
lutely necessary, and the garlic, if added at all, should be parboiled 
first, as its strong flavour, combined with that of the eschalots, would 
scarcely suit the general taste. When the lean of a dressed ham is at 
hand, only the herbs and vegetables will need to be stewed in the but- 
ter; this should be mixed with them into the forcemeat, which an 
intelligent cook will vary in many ways. 

PUREE OF TOHATAfl. 

Divide a dozen fine ripe tomatas, squeeze out the seeds, and take off 
the stalks; put them with one small mild onion (or more, if liked), aa^" 
about half a pint of very good gravy, into a well-tinned stewpan or 
saucepan, and simmer them for nearly or quite an hour ; a couple of 
bay-leaves, sqme cayenne, and as much salt as the dish may require 
should be added when they bes'hi to boil. Press them through a sieve, 
heat them again, and stir to 5iem a quarter-pint of good cream, previ- 
ously mixed and boiled for five minutes with a teaspoonful of flour. 
This puree is to be served with calf's head, veal cutlets, boiled knuckle 
of veal, calf's brains, or beef palates. For pork, beef, geese, and other ' 
brown meats, the tomatas should be reduced to a proper consistency in 
rich and highly-flavoured brown gravy, or Spanish sauce. 

MUSHROOMS Au BEURRE ; (^deliciotu.') 

Cut the stems from some fine meadow mushroom-buttons, and clean 
them with a bit of new flannel and some flue salt, then either wipe them 
dry with a soft cloth, or rinse them in fresh water, drain them quickly, 
spread them in a clean cloth, fold it over them, and leave them ten 
minutes, or more, to dry. For every pint of them thus prepared, put an 
ounce and a half of fresh butter into a thick iron saucepan, shake it over 
the fire until ii just begins to brown, throw in the mushrooms, continue 
to shake the saucepan over a clear fire, that they may not stick to it, 
nor burn, and when they have simmered three or four minutes, strew 
over them a little salt, some cayenne, and pounded mace ; stew them 
until they are perfectly tender, heap them in a dish, and serve them 
with their own sauce only, for breakfast, supper, or luncheon. Nothing 
can be finer than the flavour of the mushrooms thus prepared ; and the 
addition of any liquid is far from an improvement to it They are very 
good when drained from the butter and served cold, and in a cool larder 
may be kept for several days. The butter in which they are stewed is 
admirable for flavouring gravies, sauces, or potted meats. Small flaps, 
freed from the fur and skin, may be stewed in the same way ; and either 
these or the buttons, served under roast poultry or partridges, will give 
a dish of very superior relish. 

Meadow mushrooms, 3 pints, fresh butter, 4^ ozs.: 3 to 5 minutes. 
Halt, 1 small teaspoonful ; mace, half as much ; cayenne, third of salt- 



CHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. 243 

8poonfal: 10 to 15 minutes. More spices to be added if required — 
much dependiug on their quality ; but they should not overpower the 
flavour of the mushrooms. 

Obs, — Persons inhabiting parts of the country where mushrooms are 
abundant, may send them easily, when thus prepared (or when potted 
by the following receipt), to their friends in cities, or in less productive 
counties. If poured into jars, with sufficient butter to cover them, they 
will travel any distance, and can be rewarmed for use. 

POTTED MUSHUOOMS. 

Prepare either small flaps or buttons with great nicety, without wet- 
ting them, and wipe the former very dry, after the applicq^tion of the 
salt and flannel. Stew them quite tender, with the satne proportion 
of butter as the mushrooms au beurre, but increase a little the quantity 
of spice ; when they are done turn them into a large dish, spread them 
over one end of it, and raise it two or three inches, that they may be 
well drained from the butter. As soon as they are quite cold, press 
them very closely into small potting-pans ; pour lukewarm clarified 
butter thickly over them, and store them in a cool dry place. If in- 
tended for present use, merely turn them down upon a clean shelf; but 
for longer keeping, cover the tops first with very dry paper, and then 
with melted mutton-suet We have ourselves had the mushrooms, after 
being simply spread upon a dish while hot, remain perfectly good in 
that state for seven or eight weeks : they were prepared late in the 
season, and the weather was consequently cool during the interval. 

• 

MUSHROOM-TOAST, OR CROUTE AVX OHAMPIQNONS; (eXCeUent.) 

Cut the stems closely from a quart, or more, of small just-opened 
mushrooms, peel them, and take out the fur. Dissolve from two to 
three ounces of fresh butter in a well-tinned saucepan or stewpan ; put 
in the mushrooms, strew over them a quarter-teaspoonful of pounded 
mace mixed with a little cayenne, and let them stew over a gentle fire 
from ten to fifteen minutes ; toss or stir them often during the time ; 
then add a small dessertspoonful of flour, and shake the pan round until 
it is lightly browned. Next pour in, by slow degrees, half a pint of 
gravy or of good beef-broth; and when the mushrooms have stewed 
softly in this for a couple of minutes, throw in a little salt, and a squeeze 
of lemon-juice, and pour theon on to a crust, cut about an inch and a 
quarter thick, from the under part of a moderate-sized loaf, and fried in 
good butter to a light brown, after having been first slightly hol- 
lowed in the inside. New milk, or thin cream, may be used with very 
good effect instead of the gravy ; but a few strips of lemon-rind, and a 
small portion of nutmeg and mushroom-catsup should then be added to 
the sauce. The bread may be buttered and grilled over a gentle fire 
instead of being fried, and is better so. 

Small mushrooms, 4 to 5 half pints ; butter, 3 to 4 ozs. ; mace, mixed 
with a little cayenne, ^ teaspoonful : stewed softly 10 to 15 minutes. 
Flour, 1 small dessertspoonful : 3 to 5 minutes. Gravy or broth, ^ pint: 
2 minutea Little salt and lemon-juice. 

TO BOIL SPROUTS, CABBAGES, SAVOYS, LETTUCES, OR ENDIVE. 

All green vegetables should be thrown into abundance of fast-boiling 
water ready salted and skimmed, with the addition of the morsel of soda 






2M MODSRN COOKERY. [CBAF. X^. 

which we have recommended, in a previous pa^W this chapter; the 
pan should he left uncovered, and every precaution taken to prevent the 
smoke from reaching its contents. Endive, sprouts, and spring greens, 
will only require copious washing before they are boiled; but savoys, 
large lettuces, and close-leaved cabbages should be thrown into salt and 
water for half an hour or more before they are dressed, with the tops 
downwards to draw out the insects. The stems of these last should be 
cut o^ lie decayed leaves stripped away, and the vegetable halved or 
quartered, or split deeply across- the stalk-end, and divided entirely 
before it is dished. 

Very young greens, 15 to 20 minutes ; lettuces, 20 to 30 minutes ; 
large savovs, or cabbages, 1 to 1^ hour, or more. 

Obt. — When the sUdk of any kind of cabbage is tender, it is done. 
Turnip-greens should be well washed in several waters, and boiled in a 
very large quantity to deprive them of their bitterness. 

STEWED CABBAGE. 

Cut out the stalk entirely, and slice a fine firm cabbage or two in very 
thin strips; throw them after they have been well vvashed and drained, 
into a large pan of boiling water ready salted and skimmed, and when 
they are tender, which will be in from ten to fifteen minutes, pour them 
into a sieve or strainer, press the water thoroug;hly from them, and chop 
them slightly. Put into a very clean saucepan about a couple of ounces 
of butter, and when it is dissolved add the cabbage, with sufiicient pep- 
per and salt to season it, and stir it over a clear fire until it appears 
tolerably dry ; then shake lightly in a tablespoonful of flour, turn the 
whole well, and add by slow degrees a cup of thick cream : veal gr&vy 
or good white sauce may be suletituted for this, when preferred to it 

TO BOIL TURNIPS. 

Pare entirely from them the stringy rind, and either split the turnips 
once or leave them whole ; throw them into boiling water slightly salted 
and keep them closely covered from smoke and dust till they are tender. 
When small and young they will be done in from fifteen to twenty 
minutes ; at their mil growth they will require from three quarters to a 
full hour, or more, of gentle boiling. After they become old and woolly, 
they are not worth dressing in any way. When boiled in their skins 
and pared afterwards, they are said to be of better flavour and much 
less watery than when cooked in the usual way. 

Young turnips, 15 to 20 minutes : full grown, j to 1 hour, or more. 

TO MASH TURNIPS. 

Split them once or even twice should they be large ; after they are 
pared, boil them very tender, and press the water thoroughly from them 
with k couple of trenchera, or with the back of a large plate and one 
trencher. To ensure their being free from lumps, it is better to pass 
them through a cullender or coarse hair-sieve, with a wooden spoon ; 
though, when quite young, they may be worked sufliciently smooth 
without thi& Put them into a clean saucepan, and stir them constantly 
for some minutes over a gentle fire, that they may be very dry ; then add 
some salt, a bit of firesh butter, and a little cream, or in lieu of this new 
milk (we would also recommend a seasoning of white pepper or cayenne, 
when appearance and &shion are not particularly regarded), and con 



CHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. 345 

tinae to simmer and to stir them for five or six mioutes longer, or until 
they have quite absorbed all the liquid which has been poured to them. 
Serve them always as hot as possible. This is an excellent receipt 

Turnips, weighed after they are pared, 3 lbs. : dried 5 to 8 minutes. 
Salt, 1 teaspoonful; butter, 1 oz. to 1^ oz. ; cream or milk, nearly i 
pint : 5 or 6 minutes. 

T17RNIPS IN WHITE SAUCE. (ENTREMETS.) 

When no scoop for the purpose is at hand, cut some small finely* 
grained turnips into quarters, and pare them into balls, or into the shape 
of plums or pears of equal size ; arrange them evenly in a broad stew- 
pan o» saucepan, and cover them nearly with good veal broth, throw in 
a little salt, and a morsel of sugar, and boil them rather quickly until 
they are quite tender, but unbroken ; lift them out, draining them well 
from the broth ; dish, and pour over them some thick white sauce. As 
an economy, a cup of cream, and a teaspoonful of arrowroot, may be 
added to the broth in which the turnips have stewed, to make the sauce ; 
and when it boils, a small slice of butter may be stirred and well worked 
into it, should it not be sufiiciently rich without. 

T1TBNIPS STEWED IN BUTTEK. (OOOD.) 

This is an excellent way of dressing the vegetal^le when it is mild 
and finely grained ; but its flavour otherwise is too strong to be agreea- 
ble. After they have been washed, wiped quite dry, and pared, slice 
the turnips nearly half an inch thick, and divide them into dice. Just 
dissolve an ounce of butter for each half-pound of the turnips, put them 
in as flat as they can be, and stew theip very gently indeed, from three 
quarters of an hour to a fiill hour. Add a seasoning of salt and white 
pepper when they are half done. When thus prepared, they may be 
dished over fried or nicely broiled mutton cutlets, or served by them- 
selves. 

For a small dish: turnips, 1^ lb. ; butter, 3 ozs. ; seasoning of white 
pepper ; salt, i teaspoonful, or more : | to 1 hour. Large dish, turnips, 
2 lbs. ; butter, 4 ozs. 

TURNIPS IN ORAVT. 

To a pound of turnips sliced and cut into dice, pour a quarter-pint of 
boiling veal gravy, add a small lump of sugar, some salt and cayenne, 
or white pepper, and boil them quickly from fifty to sixty minutes. 
Serve them very hot 

TO BOIL CARROTS. 

Wash the mould from them, and scrape the skin off lightly with the 
edge of a sharp knife, or, should this be objected to, pare them as thin 
and as equally as possible ; in either case firee them from all blemishes, 
and should they be very large, Iftplit them across the tops a few inches 
down ; rinse them well, and throw thefii' into plenty of boiling watei 
with some salt in it. The skin of veryyoiing carrots may be rubbed 
off^ like that of new potatoes, and from twenty to thirty minutes will 
then be sufficient to boil them; but at their full growth thev wi}I r^qifif^ 
from an hour and a half to two hours. It was fbfnjerly th§ pi^stom to 
tie them in a cloth, and to wipe the skin &om ];hen^ with it after they 
were dressed; and old-&shioned. cooks still use one to remove it; but

all vecetables should, we think, be dished and served with the Jeast 
poBsible delay after they are ready for table. Melted butter should 
accompany boiled carrots. 

Very young carrots, 20 to 30 minutes. Full-grown ones, \^\o2 
hours. 

SWEET CARROTS. (ENTREMETS.) 

Boil quite tender some fine highly-flavoured carrots, press the water 
from them, and rub them through the back of a fine hair-sieve ; put 
them into a clean saucepan or stewpan, and dry them thoroug^hly over 
a centle fiie ; then add a slice of fresh butter, and when this is dis- 
solved and well mixed with them, strew in a dessertspoonful or more 
c^ powdered sugar, and a little salt; next, stir in by degrees som^good 
cream, and when this is quite absorbed, and the carrots again appear 
dry» dish and serve them quickly with small sippets, d la Reine (see 
paffe 40), placed round them. 

Carrots, 3 lbs., boiled quite tender : stirred over a gentle fire 5 to 10 
minutes. Butter, 2 ozs. ; salt, ^ teaspoonful ; pounded sugar, 1 dessert- 
spoonful; cream, 4 pint, stewed gently together until quit€ dry. 

Obs. — For excellent mashed carrots omit the sugar, add a good sea« 
soning of salt and white pepper, and half a pint of rich brown gravy; or 
for a plain dinner rather less than this of milk. 

CARROTS AV BEURRE, OR BUTTERED CARROTS. 

Either boil sufficient carrots for a dish auite tender, and then cut them 
Into slices a quarter-inch thick, or first slice, and then boil them : the 
latter method is the most expeditious, but the other best preserves the 
flavour of the vegetable. Drain them well, and while this is being done 
just dissolve from two to four ounces of butter in a saucepan, and strew 
m some minced parsley, some salt, and wiiite pepper or cayenne ; then 
/ add the carrots, and toss them very gently until they are equally covered 
with the sauce, which should not be allowed to boil : the parsley may 
be omitted at pleasure. Cold carrots may be rewarmed in this way. 

TO BOIL PAR6NEPS. 

These are dressed in precisely the same manner as carrots, but re- 
quire much less- boiling. According to their quality and the time of 
year, they will take from twenty minutes to nearly an hour. Every 
speck or blemish should be cut from them after they are scraped, and 
the water in which they are boiled should be well skimmed. They are 
a favourite accompaniment to salt-fish and boiled pork, and may be 
served either mashed or plain. 

20 to 55 minutes. 

FRIED PAR8NEPS. 

Boil them until they are about half done, lift them out, and let them 
cool ; slice them rather thickly, sprinkle them with fine salt and white 
pepper, and firy them a pale brown in good butter. Serve them with 
Xpisi meat, or dish them under it 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. 

Wash the artichokes, pare them quickly, and throw them as they are 
done into a saucepan of^cold water, or of equal parts of milk and water; 
and whei) they are about half boiled add a little salt to them. Take 



CHAP. XV.] - VEGETABLES. M7 

them op the instant they are perfectly tender: this will be Ji from 
fifteen to twenty-five minutes, so much do they vary as to the time 
necessary to dress them. If allowed to remain in the water after they 
are done, they become black and flavourless. Melted butter should 
always be sent to table with them. 
15 to 25 minutes. 

TO FBT JEBV8AI.BM ARTICHOKSB. (SMTBEMSTS.) 

Boil them from eight to twelve minutes; lift them out, drain them 
, on a sieve, and let them cool ; dip them into beaten eggs, and cover 
them with fine bread-crumbs. Fry them a light brown, £ain, pile them 
in a hot dish, and serve them quickly. 

HARICOTS BLANC8. 

The haricot blanc is the seed of a particular kind of French bean, of 
which we find some difficulty in ascertaining the English name, lor 
though we have tried several which resemble it in appearance, we have 
fi>und their flavour, after they were dressed, very diflerent, and fiir from 
agreeable. The large white Dutch runner is, we believe, the proper 
variety fi)r cooking; at least we have obtained a small quantity under 
that name, which approached much more nearly than any others we 
had tried to those which we had eaten abroad. The haricots, when 
freshly harvested, may be thrown into plenty of boiling water, with 
some salt and a spiall bit of butter; if old, they must be previously 
soaked for an hour or two, put into cold water, brought to boil ^ntly, 
and simmered until they are tender, for if boiled fast the skins will burst 
before the beans are done. Drain them thoroughly from the water when 
*,hey are ready, and lay them into a clean saucepan over two or three 
ounces of fresh butter, a small dessertspoonful of chopped parsley, and 
sufficient salt and pepper to season the whole ; then gently shake or 
toss the beans until they are quite hot and equally covered with th€ 
sauce; add the strained juice of half a lemon, and serve them quickly. 
The vegetable thus dressed is excellent; and it aflbrds a convenient 
resource in the season when the supply of other kinds is scantiest In 
some countries the dried beans are placed in water, over-night, upon a 
stove, and by a very gentle degree of warmth are sufficiently softened 
by the following day to be served as follows: — ^they are drained from 
the water, spread on a clean cloth and wiped quite dry, then lightly 
floured and fried in oil or butter, with a seasoning of pepper and salt, 
lifted into a hot dish, and served under roast beef^ or mutton. 

TO BOIL BEET ROOT. 

Wash the roots delicately clean, but neither scrape nor cut them, as 
not a fibre even should be trimmed away, until after the^ are dressed. 
Throw them into boiling water, and according to their size boil them 
from one hour and a half to two hours and a half. Pare and serve them 
whole, or thickly sliced, and send melted butter to table with them. 
Beet-root is often mixed with winter salads ; and it makes a pickle q^ 
beautiful colour ; but one of the most usual modes of serving it at tne 

£ resent day is, with the cheese, cold and merely pared and sliced, after 
aving been boiled or baked. 
1| to 2^ hours. Baked, 2^ to 3^ hours. 
Obs, — ^This root must not be probed with a fork like other vegetar 



248 MODERN COOKERY. ' [cHAP. XV. 

bics, to ascertain if it be done or not ; but the cook mnst endeavour, by 
attention, to learn the time required for it After it is lifted out, the 
thickest part may be pressed with the fingers, to which it will yield, if 
it be sufficiently boiled. 

TO BAKE BEET ROOT. 

Beet root, if slowly and carefully baked until it is tender quite 
through, is very rich and sweet in flavour, although less bright in 
colour than when it is boiled : it is also, we believe, remarkably nutri- 
tious and wholesome. Wash and wipe it very dry, but neither cut nor 
break any part of it ; then lay it into a coarse dish, and bake it in a 
^ntle oven for four or five hofirs : it will sometimes require even a longer 
. ? me than this. Pare it quickly if to be served hot ; but leave it to cool 
rst, when it is to be sent to table cold. 

The white beet-root is dressed exactly like the red : the leaves of it 
re boiled and served like asparagus. 
In slow oven from 4 to 6 hours. 

STEWED BEET ROOT. 

Bake or boil it tolerably tender, and let it remain until it is cold, then 
pare and cut it into slices ; heat and stew it for a short time in some 
jfood pale veal gravy (or in strong veal broth for ordinary occasions), 
Ihicken this wil£ a teaspoonful of arrow-root, and half a cupful or more 
jf good cream, and stir in, as it is taken from the fire, from a tea to a 
^blespoonful of vinegar. The beet may be served likewise in thick 
white sauce, to which, just before it is dished, the mild eschalots of 
page 138 may be added. 

TO STEW RED CABBAGE. {Flemish Receipt.) 

Strip the outer leaves from a fine and fresh red cabbage ; wash it 
well, and cut it into the thinnest possible slices, beginning at the top; 
put it into a thick saucepan in which two or three ounces of good but- 
ter have been just dissolved ; add some pepper and salt, and stew it very 
slowly indeed for three or four hours in its own juice, keeping it often 
stirred, and well pressed down. When it is perfectly tender add a 
tablespoonful of vinegar ; mix the whole up tlioroughly, heap the cab- 
bage in a hot dish, and serve broiled sausages round it ; or omit these 
last, and substitute lemon-juice, cayenne pepper, and a balf^upful of 
good gravy. 

The stalk of the cabbage should be split in quarters and taken en- 
tirely out in the first instance. 

3 to 4 hours. 

BOILED CELERY. 

This vegetable is extremely good dressed like sea-kale, and served 
on a toast with rich melted butter. Let it be freshly dug, wash it with 
great nicety, trim the ends, take off the coarse outer-leaves, cut the 
roots of equal length, tie them in bunches, and boil them in plenty 
oC water, with the usual proportion of salt, from twenty to thirty 
minutes. 

20 to 30 minutes. 

STEWED CELERY. 

Cut five or six fine roots of celery to the length of the inside of the 
dish in which they are to be served ; free them from all the coarser 



CHAP. Xy.3 VEGETABLES. 240 

leaves, and from the green tope, trim the root ends neatly, and wadi 
the vegetable in several waters till it is as clean as possible; then, 
either boil it tender with a little salt, and a bit of fresh butter the size 
of a walnut, in just sufficient water to cover it quite, drain it well, 
arrange it on a very hot dish, and pour a thick bechamel, or white sauce 
over It ; or stew it in broth or common stock, and serve it with very 
rich, thickened, Espegnole or brown gravy. It has a higher flavour 
when partially stewed in the sauce, after being drained thoroughly from 
the broth: Imless very large and old, it will be done in from twenty- 
five to thirty minutes, but if not quite tender, longer time must be al* 
lowed for it A cheap and expeditious meUiod of preparing this dish is 
to slice the celery, to simmer it until soft in as much good broth as will 
only just cover it, and to add a thickening of flour and butter, or arrow- 
root, with some salf^ pepper, and a small cupful of cream. 
25 to 30 minutes, or more. 

STEWED ONIONS. 

Strip the outer skin from four or five fine Portugal onions, and trim 
the ends, but without cutting into the vegetable ; arrange them in a 
saucepan of sufficient size to contain them all in one layer; just cover 
them with good beef, or veal gravy, ai)d stew them very gently indeed 
for a couple of hours : they should be tender quite through, but should 
not be allowed to fall to pieces. When large, but not mild onions are ' 
used, they should be first boiled for half an hour in plentv of water, 
then drained from it, and put into boiling gravy : strong, well-flavoured 
broth of veal or beef) is sometimes substituted for this, and with the 
addition of a little catsu{>, spice, and thickening answers very well. 
The savour of this dish is heightened by flouring lightly and frying the 
onions of a pale brown before they are stewed. 

Portugal onions, 4 or ^ (if fried, 15 to 20 minutes) ; broth or gravy, 1 
to IJ pint : nearly or quite 2 houra 

Ohs. — When the quantity of gravy is considered too much, the onions 
may be only half covered, und turned when the under side is tender, but 
longer time must be allowed for stewing them. 

[to fry onions. 

Peel and slice them evenly, have ready a pan of hot butter, or salt* 
pork fat, and fry the onions till slightly browned. 

TO BOIL ONIONS. 

Take onions of the same size, peel and wash them, lay them in aorae 
pan or kettle with a broad bottom, so that the onions may not be piled 
one upon another. Cover them with water, or milk and water if yoti 
like them very mild, and let them simmer slowly for 20 minutes, or till 
done.]'

CHAPTER XVI. 
PASTRY. 

IMTRODUCTORT REMARKS. 

The greatest possible cleanliness and nicety shoald be observed in 
makinff pastry. The slab or board, paste-rollers, tins, cutters, stamps, 
everything, in fact, used for it, and especially the hands (for these last 
are not always so Scrupulously attended to as they ought to be), should 
be equally free from the slightest soil or particle of dust The more 
expeditiously the finer kinds of crust are made and despatched to the 
oven, and the less they are touched, the better. Much of their excel- 
lence depends upon the baking also; they should have a sufficient de- 
gree of heat^o raise them quickly, but not so fierce a one as to colour 
them too much before they are done, and still less to burn them. The 
oven-door should remain closed after they are put in, and not be 
removed until the paste is set. Large raised pies require a steadUy- 
sustained, or, what is technically called a soaking heat, and to ensure 
this the oven should be made very hot, then cleared, and closely shut 
from half to a whole hour before it is used, to concentrate the heat. It 
is an advantage in this case to have a large log or two of cord-wood 
burned in it, in addition to the usual firing. 

In mixing paste, the water sliould be added gradually, and the whole 
gently drawn together with the finders, until sufficient has been added, 
when it should be lightly kneaded until it is as smooth as possible. 
When carelessly made, the surface is often left covered with small dry 
cnimbs or lumps; dr the water is poured in heedlessly in so large a 
proportion that it becomes necessary to add more flour to render it 
workable in any way ; and this ought particularly to be avoided when a 
certain weight of all the ingredients has been taken. 

TO GLAZE OR ICE PASTRY. 

The fine yellow glaze appropriate to meat pies is given with beaten 
yolk of egg, which should be laid on with a paste brush, or a small 
bunch of feathers: if a lighter colour be wished for, whisk the whple of 
the egg together, or mix a little milk with the yolk. 

The best mode of icing fruit-tarts before they are sent to the oven is, 
to moisten the paste with cold water, to sift sugar thickly upon it, and 
to press it lightly on with the hand ; but when a whiter icing is preferred, 
the pastry must be drawn from the oven when nearly baked, and brushed 
witli white of egg, whisked to a froth ; then well covered with the sifted 
sugar, and sprinkled with a few drops of water before it is put in again: 
this glazing answers also very well, though it takes a slight colour, if 
used before the pastry is baked. 

FEUILLETAGE, OR FINE FRENCH PUFF PASTE. 

This, wiien made by a good French cook, is the perfection of rich 
light crust, and will rise in the oven from one to six inches in height; 
but some practice is, without doubt, necessary to accomplish this. In 
summer it is a great advantage to have ice at hand, and to harden the 



CHAP. ZVI.l FASTRY. 251 

butter over it before it is used ; the paste also in the intervals of rolling 
is improved by being laid on an oven-leaf over a vessel containing it 
Take an equal weight of good butler free from the coarse salt which is 
found in some, and which is disadvantageous for this paste, and of fine 
dry, sifted flour ; to each pound of these allow the yolks of a couple of 
eggs, and a small teaspoonful of salt Break a few small bits of the 
butter very lightly into the flour, put the salt into the centre, and pour 
on it sufficient water to dissolve it (we do not quite understand why the 
doing this should be better than mixing it with the flour, as in other 
pastes, but jsuch is the method always pursued for it) ; add a little more 
water to the eggs, moisten the flour gradually, and make it into a very 
smooth paste, rather lithe in summer, and never exceedingly siiS, though 
the opposite fault, in an extreme, would render the crust unmanageable. 
Press, in a sofl tliin cloth, all the moisture from the remainder of the 
butter, and form it into a ball, but in doing this be careful not to soften 
it too much. Should it be in an unfit state for pastry, from the heat of 
the weather, put it into a basin, and set the basin in a pan of water 
mixed with plenty of salt and saltpetre, and let it remain in a cool place 
for an hour if possible, before it is used. When it is ready (and the 
paste should never be commenced until it be so), roll the crust out 
square,* and of sufflcient size to enclose the butter, flatten this a little 
upon it in the centre, and then fold the crust well over it, and roll it out 
thin as lightlj^ as possible, after having dredged the board and paste- 
roller with a little flour : this is called giving it one turn. Then fold it 
in three, give it another turn, and set it aside, where it will be very cool, 
for a few minutes; give it two more turns in the same way, rolling it 
each time very lightly, but of equal thickness, and to the full length 
that it will reach, taking always especial care that the butter shall not 
break through the paste. Let it again be set aside to become cold ; and 
after it has been twice more roll^ and folded in three, give it a half- 
turn, by folding it once only, and it will be ready for use. 

£qual weight of the finest flour and good butter ; to each pound of 
these, the yolks of two eggs, and a small saltspoonfiil of salt: 6} turns 
to be given to the paste. 

TERT GOOD LIGHT PASTE. 

Mix with a pound of sifted flour six ounces of fresh, pure lard, and 
make them into a smooth paste with cold water ; press the buttermilk 
from ten ounces of butter, and form it into a ball, by twisting it in a 
clean cloth. Roll out the paste, put the ball of butter in the middle, 
close it like an applc^umpling, and roll it very lightly until it is less 
than aii inch thick ; fold the ends into the middle, dust a little flour over 
the board and paste-roller, and roll the paste thin a second time, then set 
it aside for three or four minutes in a very cool place ; give it two more 
turns, and after it has again been left for a few minutes, roll it out 
twice more, folding it each time in three. This ouffht to render it fit 
for use. The sooner this paste is sent to the oven aner it is made, the 
lighter it will be : if allowed to remain long before it is baked, it will 
be tough and heavy. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; lard, 6 ozs. ; butter, 10 ozs. ; little salt 

*Tbe learner will perhnps find it easier to ibid the paste securely round it in tbu 
forui of a dumpling, until a little experience has been acquired.

BNOLUII P17FF-PA8TE. 

Break lightly into a (X)uple of pounds of dried and sifted flour, eight 
ounces of butter; add a pinch of salt, and sufficient cold water to make 
the paste ; work it as quickly and as lightly as possible, until it is smooth 
and pliable, then level it with the paste-roller until it is three-quarters 
of an inch thick, and place regularlv upon it six ounces of butter in 
small bits; fold the paste like a blanketppudding, roll it out again, lay 
on it six ounces more of butter^ repeat the rolling, dusting each time a 
little flour over the board and paste, add again six ounces of butter, and 
roll the paste out thin three or four times, folding the ends into the 
middle. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; little salt; butter, 1 lb. 10 ozs. 

If very rich paste be required, equal portions of flour and butter must 
be used ; and the latter may be divided into two, instead of three parts, 
when it is to be rolled in. 

C3IEAM crust; (vcTtf good.^ 

Stir a little fine salt into a pound of dry flour, and mix gradually 
with it sufficient very thick, sweet cream to form a smooth paste ; it will 
be found sufficiently good for common family dinners, without the addi- 
tion of butter ; but to make an excellent crust, roll in four ounces in the 
usual way, after having given the paste a couple of turns. Handle it 
as lightly as possible in making it, and send it to the oven as soon as it 
is ready; it may be used for fruit tarts, cannelons, pufls, and other 
varieties of small pastry, or for good meat-pies. Six ounces of butter 
to the pound of flour will give a very rich crust 

Flour, 1 lb.; salt, 1 small saltspoonful (more for meat pies); rich 
cream, i to j pint ; butter, 4 ozs. ; for richest chist, 6 ozs. 

PATE BEISEE, OR FRENCH CRUST FOR HOT OR COLD HEAT-PIES. 

Sift two pounds and a quarter of fine dry flour, and break into it one 
pound of butter, work them together with the fingers until they resem- 
ole fine crumbs of bread, then add a small teaspoonful of salt, and make 
them into a firm paste, with the yolks of four eggs, well beaten, mixed 
with half a pint of cold water, and strained : or for a somewhat richer 
crust of the same kind, take two pounds of flour, one of butter, the 
yolks of four eggs, half an ounce of salt, and less than the half-pint of 
water, and work the whole well until the paste is perfectly smooth.

FLEAD CRUST. 

Flead is the provincial name for the leaf, or inside fat of a pig, which 
makes excellent crust when fresli, much finer, indeed, than after it is 
melted into lard. Clear it quite fhmi skin, and slice it very thin into 
the flour, add sufficient salt to give flavour to the paste, and raaJse the 
whole up smooth and firm with cold water; lay it on a clean dresser, 
and beat it forcibly with a rolling-pin until the flead is blended perfectly 
with the flour. It may then be niade into cakes with a paste-cutter, or 
used for pies, round the edges of which a knife should be passed, as the 
crR^ rises better when cut than if merely rolled to the pvoper size. 
With the addition of a small quantity of butter, which may either be 



a 

GHAP« XVI.3 PASmtY. 253 

broken into the floor before the flead is mixed with it, or rolled into tho 
paste after it is beaten, it will be found eqoal to fine pufT crust, with the 
advantage of bein^ more easy of digestion. 

Quite common crust : flour, 1 ^ lb. ; flead, 8 ozs. ; salt, 1 small tea- 
spoonful. Good common crust: floor, 1 lb. ; flead, 6 ozs. ; butter, 2 ozs. 
Rich crust : flead, j lb. ; butter, 2 ozs. ; flour, 1 lb. The crust is very 
good when made without any butter. 

COMMON SUET-CRUBT lOR P1B8. 

• 

In many families this is preferred both for pies and tarts, to crust made 
with butter, as being much more wholesome; but it should never be 
served unless especicLily ordered, as it is to some persons peculiarly dis- 
tasteful. Chop the suet extremely small, and add from six to eight 
ounces of it to a pound of flour, with a few g'rains of salt ; mix these 
with cold water into a firm paste, and work it very snSooth. Some 
cooks beat it with a paste-roller, until the suet is perfectly blended with 
the flour ; but the crust is lighter without tliis. In exceedingly sultry 
weather the suet, not being firm enough to chop, may be sliced as thin 
as possible, and well beaten into the paste after it is woi^ked up. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; beef or veal kidney-suet, 12 to 16 ozs. ; salt (for fruit- 
pies), i teaspoonful; for meatrpies, 1 teaspoonful. 

YERT SUPERIOR SUFT-CRUST. 

Strip the skin entirely from some fresh veal or beef kidney-suet ; chop, 
and then put it into the mortar, with a small quantity of pure-flavoured 
lard, oil, or butter, and pound it perfectly smooth : it may then be used 
for crust in the same way that butter is, in making pufF-paste, and in 
this form will be found a most excellent substitute ror it, for hot pies or 
tarts. It is not quite so good for those which are to be served cold. 
Eight ounces of suet pounded with two of butter, and worked with the 
fingers into a pound of flour, will make an exceedingly good short crust ; 
but for a very rich one, the proportion must be increased. 

Good short crust : flour, 1 lb. ; suet, 8 ozs. ; butter, 2 ozs. ; salt, J 
teaspoonful. Richer crust : suet, 16 ozs. ; butter, 4 ozs. ; flour, 1} lb. ; 
salt, 1 small teaspoonfuL 

VERY RICH SHORT CRUST FOR TARTS. 

. Break lightly, with the least possible handling, six ounces of butter 
into eight of flour ; add a dessertspoonful of pounded sugar, and two or 
three of water ; roll the paste for several minutes, to blend the ingre- 
dients well, folding it together li]|^ pu^crust, and touch it as little as 
possible. 

Flour, 8 ozs. ; butter, 6 ozs. ; pounded sugar, 1 dessertspoonful ; water,

BRIOCHE PASTE. 

The brioche is a rich, light kind of unsweetened bun, or cake, very 
commonly sold, and served to all classes of people in France, where it 
isi made in great perfection by good cooks and pastry-cooks. It is 
fashionable at some tables, though in a difl^rent form, serving princi- 
pally as a crust to enclose rissoles^ or to make cannelons and fritters. 
We have seen it recommended for a vol^u-vent^ for which we should 
say it does not answer by any means so well as the fine pufl^paste called 
feuilletage. The large proportion of butter and eggs which it contain?

render it to many persons highly indigestible ; and we mention this to 
warn invalids agamst it, as we have known it to cause great suffering 
to persons out of health. To make it, take a couple of pounds* of fine 
dry flour, sifted as hr cakes, and separate eight ounces of this from the 
remainder to make the leaven. Put it into a small pan, and mix it 
lightly into a lithe paste, with half an ounce of yeast, and a spoonful 
/or two of warm water ; make two or three slight incisions across the 
top, throw a cloth over the pan, and place it near the fire for about 
twenty minutes, to rise. In the interval make a hollow space in the 
centre of the remainder of the flour, and put into it half an ounce of 
salt, as much fine sifled sugar, and half a gill of cream, or a dessert- 
spoonful of water ; add a pound of butter, as free from moisture as it 
can be, and quite so from large grains of salt; cut it into small bits, put 
it into the flour, and pour on it one by one six fresh eggs freed from the 
specks ; then With the fingers work the flour gently into this mass until 
the whole forms a perfectly smooth, and not stiff paste: a seventh egg^ 
or the yolk of one, or even of two, may be added with advantage if the 
flour will absorb them ; but the brioche must always be workable, and 
not so moist as to adhere to the board and roller disagreeably. When 
the leaven is well risen spread this paste out, and the leaven over it ; 
mix them well together with the hands, then cut the whole into several 
portions, and change them about that the leaven may be incorporated 
perfectly and equally with the other ingredients: when this is done, 
and the brioche is perfectly smooth and pliable, dust some flour on a 
cloth, roll the brioche in it, and lay it into a pan ; place it in summer in 
a cool place, in winter in a warm one. It is usually made over-night, 
and baked in the early part of the following day. It should then be 
kneaded up afresh the first thing in the morning. To mould it in the 
usual form, make it into balls of uniform size, hollow these a little at 
the top by pressing the thumb round them, brush them over with yolk 
of egg, and put a second much smaller ball into the hollow part of each ; 
glaze them entirely with yolk of egg, and send them to a quick oven 
for half an hour or more. The paste may also be made into the form 
of a large cake, then placed on a tin, or copper oven-leaf, and supported 
with a pasteboard in the baking ; for the form of which see introductory 
page of Chapter XXIII. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; yeast, i oz. ; salt and sugar, each i oz. ; butter, 1 lb. ; 
eggs, 6 to 8. 

MODERN POTATO PASTY ; (em excellent family dish,) 

A tin mould of the construction shown in the plate, with a perforated 
moveable top, and a small valve to allow the escape of the steam, must 
be had for this pasty, which is an excellent family dish, and which may 
be varied in numberless ways. Arrange at the bottom of the mould 
from two to three pounds of mutton cutlets, freed, according to the 
taste, from all, or from the greater portion of the fat, then washed, 
lightly dredged on both sides with flour, and seasoned with salt and 
pepper or cayenne. Pour to them sufficient broth or water to make 

* It should be remarked, thnt the directions for brioche-making are principally de- 
rived from the French, and that the pound in their country weighs two onncea more 
than with us : this difference will account for the difficulty of working in the number 
of eggs which they generally specify, and which render the paste too moist.

the gravy, and add to it at pleasure a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup 
or of Harvey*s sauce. Have ready boiled, and very smoothly mashed, 
with about an ounce of butter, and a spoonful or two of milk or cream 
to each pound, as many good potatoes as will form a crust to the pasty 
of quite three inches thick ; put the cover on the mould, and arrange 





these equally upon it, leaving them a little rough on the surface. Bake 
the pastry in a moderate oven from three quarters of an hour to an hour 
and a quarter,^ according to its size and its contents. Pin a folded nap- 
kin neatly round the mould, before it is served, and have ready a hot 
dish to receive the cover, which must not be lifted off until after the 
pasty is on the table. 

Chicken, or veal and oysters ; delicate pork chops with a seasoning 
of sa^e and a little parboiled onion, or an eschalot or two finely minced ; 
partridges or rabbits neatly carved, mixed with small mushrooms, and 
moistened with a little good stock, will all give excellent varieties of 
this dish, which may be made likewise with highly seasoned slices of 
salmon freed from the skin, sprinkled with fine herbs or intermixed 
with shrimps ; clarified butter, rich veal stock, or good white wine, may 
be poured to them to form the gravy. To thicken this, a little flour 
should b<i dredged upon the fish before it is laid into the mould. Other 
kinds, such as cod, mackerel in fillets, salt fish (previously kept at the 
point of boiling until three parts done, then pulled into flakes, and put 
into the mould with hard eggs sliced, a little cream, flour, butter, cay- 
' enne, and anchovy-essence, and baked with mashed parsneps on the 
top), will all answer well for this pasty. Veal, when used for it, should 
be well beaten first: sweetbreads, sliced, may be laid in with it. 

For a pasty of moderate size, two pounds, or two and a half of meat, 
and from three to four of potatoes will be sufficient : a quarter-pint of 
milk or cream, two small teaspoonsful of salt, and from one to two 
ounces of butter must be mixed up with these last* 

MODERN CHICKEN PIE. 

Skin, and cut down into joints a couple of fowls, take out all the 
bones, and season the flesh highly with salt, cayenne, pounded maces, 
and nutmeg; line a dish with a thin paste, and spread over it a layer 
of the finest sausage-meat, which has previously been moistened with a 
Fpoonful or two of cold water ; over this place closely together some of 
the boned chicken joints, then more sausage-meat, and continue thus 

* A lar^rer proportion of cream and butter well dried into the potatoes over a gentlt

with alternate layers of each, until the dish is full ; roll out, and &steD 
•ecurely at the edges, a cover half an inch thick, trim off the .superflu- 
ous paste, make an incision in the top, lav some paste leaves round it, 
fflaze the whole with yolk of egg, and bake the pie from an hour and a 
Half to two hours in a well-heaU^ oven. Lay a sheet or two of writing- 
piper over the crust, should it brown too quickly. Minced herbs can 
oe mixed with the sausage-meat at pleasure, and a small quantity of 
eschalot also, where the Savour is much liked : it should be well moist- 
ened with water, or the whole will be unpalatably dry. The pie may 
be served hot or cold, but we would rather recommend the latter. 

A couple of very young tender rabbits will answer exceedingly well 
for it instead of fowls, and a border, or half paste in the dish will gene- 
rally be preferred to an entire lining of the crust, which is now but 
rarely served, unless for pastry, which is, to be taken out of the dish in 
which it is baked before jt is sent to table. 

A COMMON CHICKEN PIE. 

Prepare the fowls as for boiling, cut them down into joints, and sen- 
son them with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg, or pounded mace; 
arrange them neatly in a dish bordered with paste, lay amongst them 
three or four fresh eggs, boiled hard, and cut in halves, pour in some 
cold water, put on a thick cover, pare the edge, and ornament it, make 
a hole in the centre, lay a roll of paste, or a few leaves round it, and 
bake the pie in a moderate oven from an hour to an hour and a half. 
The back and neck bones may be boiled down with a bit or two of lean 
ham, to make a little additional gravy, which can be poured into the 
pie after it is baked. 

PIGEON PIE. 

Border a large dish with fine puiF-paste, and cover the bottom with a 
veal cutlet, or tender rump steak, free from fat and bone, and seasoned 
with salt, cayenne, and nutmeg, or poimded mace ; prepare with great 
nicety as many freshly-killed young pigeons as the dish will contain in 
one layer; put into each a slice or ball of butter, seasoned with a little 
cayenne and mace ; lay them into the dish witii the breasts downwards, 
and between and over them put the yolks of half a dozen or more of 
hard-boiled eggs ; stick plenty of butter on them, season the whole well 
with salt and' spice, pour in some cold water or veal broth for the gravy, 
roll out the cover three quarters of an inch thick, secure it well round 
the edge, ornament it highly, and bake it for an hour or more in a well- 
heated oven. It is a great improvement to fill the birds with small 
mushroom-buttons, prepared as for partridges (see Chapter XIII.) : their 
livers also may be put into them. 

BEEF-STEAK PIE. 

From a couple to three pounds of rump-steak will be sufficient for a 
good family pie. It should be well kept though perfectly sweet, for in 
no form can tainted meat be more offensive than when it is enclosed in 
paste. Trim off the coarse skin, and part of the fat, should there be 
much of it (many eaters dislike it altogether in pies, and when this is 
tlie case every morsel should be carefully cut away). If the beef should 
not appear very tender, it may be gently beaten with a paste-roller until 
the fibre is broken, then divided into slices half as large as the hand.

and Isid into a disit bordered with paste. It shoald be seasoned n^th 
salt and pepper, or cayenne, and suiBcient water poured in lo make the 
gravy and keep the meat moist. Lay od the cover, and be careful 
always to biush the edge in every part with egg or cold water, then 
join it securely to the paste which is round the rim, trim both off close 
to the dish, pass the point of the knile throogh the middle of the cover, 
laj some slight roll or ornament of paste round it, and decorate the 
bt^er of the pie in any of the usual modes, which are too coinmoo to 
reqnire description. Send the pie to a well-heated, but not fierce oven 
for about an hour and twenty minutes. To make a richer beef-eteak 
pie put bearded oyBters in alternate layers with the meat, add their 
strained liquor to a little good gravy, in which the beards may be sim- 
mered for a few minutes, to give it further Savour, and make a light 
puff paste Inr the crust. Some eaters like it seasoned with a small por- 
tion of minced onion or eschalot when tlie oysters are omitted. Mu^ 
rooms improve all meat-pies.

A pound and a quarter of dour will make sufficient paste for a mode- 
rate-sized pie, and two pounds of mutton freed from the greater portion 
of the fat will fill it Butter a dish, and line it with about half the 
paste rolled thin ; lay in the mutton evenly, and sprinkle over three 
quarters of an onnce of salt, and from half lo a whole teaspoonful of 
pepper according to the taste ; pour in cold water to within an inch of 
the brim. Roll the cover, whicli should be quite half an inch thick, to 
the size of the dish ; wet the edges of the paste with cold water or 
white of egg, be careful to close them securely, cut them off close to 
the rim of the dish, stick the point of the knife through the centre, and 
bake the pie an hour and a quarter in a well-heated oven.

SAIBED PIES. 

These may be made of any size, 
and with any kind of meat, poultry, 
or game, but the whole must be 
entirely free from bone. When 
the crust is not to be eaten, it is 
made simply with a few ounces of 
lard or butter dissolved in boiling 
water, with which the flour is to he 
mixed (with a spoon at first, as the 

heat would be too great for the B»i*Bd Pie

gers) lo a smooth and drm paste. The French, who excel greatlj' in 
this form of pie,* use for it a good crust which they call a f^le brisee

liirm perfectly ifler It is raised, as it will have no support lo prevent ita 
fiUliiig. The celebrated Monsieur Ude gives the following directions 
fbr moulding it tJ) a proper sli;ipe without difficulty; and as inexpe- 
Tienced coiiks generally find a little at first in giving a. good appearance 
to these pies, we copy his iostructiona for them: "Take a lump of 
paste proportionate to the size of the pie you are to make, mould it in 
the shape of a eu?ar loaf, put it upright on the table, then with the 
palms of your hands flatten the sides of it; when you have equalized it 
all round and it is quite smooth, squeeze the middle of the point dowa 
to half the height of the paste," tlien hollow the inside by [H-easing it 
with the finger^ and in doipg this be careful to keep it in every part of 
equal thickness. Fill it,* roll out the cover, egg the edges, press them 
securely together, make a hole in the centre, lay a roll of paste round 
it, and encircle this with a wreath of leaves, or ornament the pie inaay 
other way, according to the (aate; glaze it with well-beaten yolk of 
egg, and bake it from two to three hours in a well-heated oven if it be 
small, and from lour to five hours if it be large, though the time must 
be regulated in some measure by the nature of the cont«n(s, as well as 
by the size of the dish. 

Obi. — We know not if we have succeeded in makinsf the reader 
comprehend that this sort of pie (with the exception of tTie cover, lor 
which a portion must at first be taken off) is made from one solid lump 
of paste, which, after having been shaped into a cone, as Monsieur Ude 
directs, or ihlo a high round, or oval form, is hollowed by pressing down 
the centre with the knuckles, and continuing to knead the inside equally 
round with the one hand, while the other is pressed close to the outside. 
It is desirable that the mode of doing this should be once teen by the 
learner, if possible, aa mere verbal instructions are scarcely sufficient 
to enable the quite- inexperienced cook to compreliend at once the exact 
fprm and appearance which should be given Co the paste. 

This dish can be successfully made only with the Bnest and lightest 
puff-paste (see feuilletage, page 250), as ita height, which ought to be 
from four to five inches, de- 
pends entirely on its risiog in 
the oven. Roll it to something 
more than an inch in thick- 
nees, and cut it to the shape 
) and size of the inside of the 
dish in which it is to be served, 
or stamp it out with a fluted 
tin of proper dimensions; then 
mark the cover evenly about an inch from the edge all round, and oma- 
menl it and the border also, with a knife, as fancy may direct ; brush 
yolk of egg quickly over them, and put the vol-au-vent immediately into 
a brisk oven, that it may rise well, and be finely coloiirod, but do aot 
allow it to be scorche<l. In from twenty to thirty minutes, sliould it

appear baked throu?h^ as well as sufficiently browned, draw it out, and 
with the point of a Koife detach the cover carefully where it has been 
marked, and scoop out all the sofl unbaked crumb from the inside of the 
Tol-au-vent; then turn it gently on to a sheet of clean paper, to drain 
the butter from it At the instant of serving, fill it with a rich fricafr* 
see of lobster, or of sweetbreads, or with turbot d la creme, or with the 
white part of cold roast veal cut in thin collops not larger than a shil- 
ling, and heated in good white sauce with oysters (see minced veal and 
oysters, page 174), or with any other of the preparations which we shall 
indicate in their proper places, and send it immediately to table. The 
vol-au-vent, as the reader will perceive, is but the case, or crust, in 
which various kinds of delicate ragouts are served in an elegant form* 
As these are most frequently composed offish, or of meats which have 
been already dressed, it is an economical as well as an excellent mode 
of employing such remains. The sauces in which they are heated must 
be quite thick, for they would otherwise soften, or even run through 
the crust This, we ought to observe, should be examined before it is. 
fiUed, and should any part appear too thin, a portion of the crumb which 
has been taken out should be fastened to it with some beaten egg, and 
the whole of the inside brushed lightly with more egg, in order to make 
the loose parts of the vol-«u-vent stick well together. This method is> 
recommended bv an admirable and highly experienced cook, but it need 
only be resorted to when the crust is not solid enough to hold the con« 
tents securely. 

For modepite-eized vol-«u*vent, fiour, ^ lb. ; butter, ^ lb. ; salt, small 
saltspoonful ; yolk, 1 eg-g ; little water. Larger vol-au-vent, | lb. flour ; 
other ingredients in proportion : baked 20 to 30 minutes. 

Obs. — When the vol-au-vent is cut out with. the fiuted cutter, a second, 
some sizes smaller, after being just dipped into hot water, should be 
pressed nearly half through the paste, to mark the cover. The border 
ought to be from three quarters of an inch to an inch and a half wide. 

A VAL-AIJ-VBNT OP FRXJIT. (ENTREMETS.) 

Afler the crust has been made and baked as above, fill it at the mo- 
ment of serving with peaches, apricots, mogul, or any other ridily 
flavoured plums, which have been stewed tender in syrup; lift them 
from this, and keep them hot while it is boiled rapidly almost to jelly; 
then arrange the fruit in the vol-au-vent, and pour the syrup over it. 
For the manner of preparing it, see compotes of fruit. Chapter XX. ; but 
increase the proportion of sugar nearly half! that the juice may be 
reduced quickly to the proper consistency for the vol-au-vent Skin 
and divide the apricots, and quarter the peaches, unless they should be 
very smalL 

VOL-AV-VENT A LA CREHE. (ENTREMETS.) 

After having raised the cover and emptied the vol-au-vent, lay it on a 
sheet of paper, and let it become cold. Fill it just before it is sent to 
table with fruit, eitlier boiled down to a rich marmalade, or stewed as 
for the preceding vol-au-vent, and heap well-flavoured, but not too 
highly sweetened, whipped cream over it The edge of the crust may 
be glazed by sifting sugar over it, when it is drawn from the oven, and 
holding a salamander or red-hot shovel above it; or it may be left 
anglazed, and ornamented with brightrcoloured fi'uit jelly.

OYSTER-PATTIES.* (ENTREE.) 

Line some small patty-pans with fine puff-paste, rolled thin and to 
preserve their form when baked, put a bit of bread into each ; lay on 
the covers, pinch and trim the eages, and send the patties to a brisk 
oven. Plump and beard from two to three dozens of small oysters ; mix 
very smoothly a teaspoonful of flour with an ounce of butter, put them 
into a clean saucepan, shake them round over a gentle fire, and let them 
simmer for two or three minutes; throw in a little salt, pounded mace, 
and cayenne, then add, by slow degrees, two or three spoonsful of rich 
cream, give these a boil, and pour in the strained liquor of the oysters; 
next, lay in the fish, and keep at the point of boiling for a couple of 
minutes. Raise the covers from the patties, take out the bread, fill 
them with the oysters and their sauce, and replace the covers. We 
have found it an improvement to stew the beards of the fish with a 
strip or two of lemon-peel, in a little good veal stock for a quarter of an 
hour, then to strain and add it to the sauce. The oysters, unless very 
small, should be once or twice divided. 

GOOD CHICKEN PATTIES. (eNTREB.) 

Raise the white flesh entirely from a young undressed fowl, divide it 
once or twice, and lay it into a small clean saucepan, in which about an 
o^nce of butter has been dissolved, and just begins to simmer ; strew in 
a slight seasoning of salt, mace, and cayenne, and stew the chicken 
veiT softly indeed for about ten minutes, taking every precaution against 
its browning : turn it into a dish with the butter, and its own gravy, and 
let it become cold. Mince it with a sharp knife; heat it, witboot 
allowing it to boil, m a little good white sauce (which may be made of 
some of the bones of the ibwl), and fill ready- baked pattv-crusts, or 
small vol^U'Vents with it, just before they are sent to table ; or stew 
the flesh only just sufiicientiy to render it nrm, mix it after it is minced 
and seasoned with a spoonful or two of strong gravy, fill the patties, and 
bake them from fifteen to eighteen minutes. It is a great improvement 
to stew an(} mince a few mushrooms with the chicken. 

The breasts of cold turkeys, fowls, partridges^ or pheasants, or the 
white part of cold veal, minced, heated in a bechamel sauce, will serve 
at once for patties : they may also be made of cold game, heated in au 
Espagnole, or in a good brown gravy. 

Obs, — A spoonful or two of jellied stock or gravy, or of good white 
sauce, converts these into admirable patties: the same ingredients make 
also very superior rolls or cannelons. For patties k la Cardinale, small 
mushroom-buttons stewed as for partridges. Chapter XIIL, before they 
are minced, must be substituted for truffles ; and the butter in which 
they are simmered should be added with them to the eggs. 

EXCELLENT MEAT ROLLS. 

Pound, as for potting (see page 227), and with the same proportion 
of butter and of seasonings, some half-roasted veal, chicken, or turkey. 
Make some forcemeat by the receipt No. 1, Chapter VI., and form it 

These patties should be made small, with a thin crust, and be well-filled with the 
oysters and tbeir sauce. The substitution of fried crumbs for the covers will vary 
them v»ry agreeably. For lolwter-pattics, prepare the fish as for a vol au-vetU, but cot 
U smaller. 



CHAP. XTI.3 FINE PA0TftT. 281 

into small rolls, not ]arger than a finger ; wrap twice or thrice as much 
of the pounded meat equally round each of these, first moistening it with 
a teaspoonful of water ; fold them in good pufl^-paste, and bake them 
from fifteen to twenty minutes, or until the crust is perfectly done. A 
small quantity of the lean of a boiled ham may be finely minced and 
pounded with the veal, and very small mushrooms, prepared as for a 
partridge (page 217), may be substituted for the forcemeat 

PATTIES, TAETLSTS, OR SMALL TOLS-AU-TENTS. 

These are quickly and easily made witli two roimd paste-cutters, ci 
which one should be little more than half the size of the other : to give 
the pastry a better appearance, they should be fluted. Roll out some 
of the lightest puff'paste to a half inch of thickness, and with the larger 
of the tins cut the number of patties required ; then dip the edge of the 
small shape into hot water, and press it about half through them. Bake 
them in a moderately quick oven from ten to twelve minutes, and when 
they- are done, with Uie point of a sharp knife, take out the small rounds 
of crust firom the tops, and scoop all the crumb firom the insides of the 
patties, which may uen be filled with oysters, lobster, chicken, or any 
other of the ordinary varieties of patty meat, prepared with white sauce. 
Fried crumbs may be laid over them instead of the covers, or these last 
can be replaced. 

For sweet dishes, ^laze the pastry, and fill it with rich whipped 
cream, preserve, or boiled custard ; if with the last of these, put it back 
into a very gentle oven until the custards are set. 

ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR TARTLETS. 

For a dozen tartlets, cut twenty-four rounds of paste of the usual size, 
and form twelve of them into rings by pressing the small cutter quite 
through them ; moisten these with cold water, or white of egg^ and lay 
them on the remainder of the rounds of paste, so as to form the rims of 
the tartlets. Bake them from ten to twelve minutes, fill them with 
preserve while they are still warm, and place over it a small ornament 
of paste cut from the remnants, and baked gently of a light colour. 
Serve the tartlets cold, or if wanted hot for table put them back into 
the oven for one minute after they are filled. 

A SEFTON, OR VEAL CUSTARD. 

Pour boiling, a pint of rich, clear, pale veal gravy on six fresh eggs, 
which have been well beaten and strained : sprinkle in directly the 
grated rind of a fine lemon, a little cayenne, some salt if needed^ and a 
auarter-teaspoonful of mace. Put a paste border round a dish, pour in, 
nrst two ounces of clarified butter, and then the other ingredients; bake 
the Sefton in a very slow oven from twenty-five to thirty minutes, or 
until it is quite firm in the middle, and send it to table with a little good 
gravy. Very highly flavoured game stock, in which a few mushrooms 
have been stewed, may be used for this dish with great advantage in 
lieu of veal gravy ; and a sauce made of the smallest mushroom buttons^ 
may' be served with it in either case. The mixture can be baked in a 
whole paste, if preferred so, or in well-buttered cups ; then turned out 
Olid covered with the sauce before it is sent to table.

flour, until they resemble fine crumbs of l)read ; throw in a small pinch 
of salt, and make them into a firm smooth paste with the yolks of twc 
eggs and a spoonful or two of water. Butter thickly a plain tin cake, 
or pie mould (those which open at the sides are best aidapted for the 
purpose) ; roll out the paste thin, place the mould upon it, trim a bit to 
its exact size, cover the bottom of the mould with this, then cut a band 
the height of the sides, and press it smoothly round thenT, joining the 
edse, which must be moistened with egg or water, to the bottom crust; 
and &sten upon them, to prevent their separation, a narrow and thia 
band of paste, also moistened. Next, fill the mould nearly from the 
brim with the following marmalade, which must be quite cold when it 
is put in. Boil together, over a gentle fire at first, but more quickly 
afterwards, three pounds of good apples with fourteen ounces of pounded 
sugar, or of the finest Lisbon, the strained juice of a large lemon, three 
ounces of the best butter, and a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon, or 
the lightly grated rind of a couple of lemons : when the whole is per- 
fectly smooth and dry, turn it into a pan to cool, and let it be quite cold 
before it is put into the paste. In early autumn, a larger proportion of 
sugar may be required, but this can be regulated by the taste. When 
the mould is filled, roll out the cover, lay it carefully over the marma- 
lade that it may not touch it ; and when the cake is securely closed, 
trim off the superfluous paste, add a little pounded sugar to the parings, 
spread them out very thin, and cut them into leaves to ornament the 
top of the cake, round which they may be placed as a sort of wreath.* 
Bake it for an hour in a moderately brisk oven ; take it from the mould, 
and should the sides not be sufiiciently coloured, put it back for a few 
minutes into the oven upon a baking tin. Lay a paper over the top, 
when it is of a fine light brown, to prevent its being too deeply coloured. 
This cake should be served hot 

Paste: flour, 1 lb.; butter, 10 ozs.; yolks of eggs, 2; little water. 
Marmalade : apples, 3 lbs. ; sugar, 14 ozs. (more if needed) ; juice of 
lemon, 1 ; rinds of lemons, 2 : butter, 3 ozs. : baked, 1 hour. 

TOVRTE MERINGTJEE, OR TART "WITH ROYAL ICING.f 

Lay a band of fine paste round the rim of a tart-dish, fill it with any 
kind of fruit mixed with a moderate proportion of sugar, roll out the 
cover very evenly, moisten the edges of the paste, press them together 
carefully, and trim them off close to the dish ; spread equally over the 
top, to within rather more than an inch of the edge all round, the whites 
of three fresh eg^ beaten to a quite solid froth, and mixed quickly at 
the moment of usmg them, with three tablespoonsful of dry sifted sugar. 

* Or. instead of thesse. fasten on it with a little white of egg, after it is taken from 
the oven, some ready-baited leaves of almond-paste (see page 2C3), either plain or co- 
loured. 

t The limits to which we are obliged to confine this volume, compel us to omit many 
receipts which we would gladly insert: we have, therefore, rt'jected those which may 
be found in almost every English cookery book, for such as are. we apprehend, less 
known to the reader : this will account for the a.iiall number of receipts for pies and 
fruit tarts to be found in the present chapter. * • 



CHAP. XYI.]] FINE PASTRY. S63 

Put the tart into a moderately brisk oven, and when the crust has risen 
well, and the icinor is get, either lay a sheet of writing-paper lightly 
over it, or draw it to a part of the oven where it will not take too much 
colour. This is now a fashionable mode of icing tarts, and greatly im- 
proves their appearance. 
Bake half an hour. 

A GOOD APPLE TABT. 

A pound and a quarter of apples, weighed after they are pared and 
cored, will be sufficient for a small tart, and four ounces more for one 
of moderate size. Lay a border of English pufF-paste, or of cream-crust 
round ihe dish, just dip the apples into water, arrange them very com- 
{)actly in it, higher in the centre than at the sides, and strew amongst 
them from three to four ounces of pounded sugar, or more should they 
be very acid : the grated rind, and the strained juice of half a lemon 
will much improve their flavour. Lay on the cover rolled thin, and ice 
it or not at pleasure. Send the tart to a moderately brisk oven for 
about half an hour. This may be converted into the old-fashioned 
creamed apple tart, by cutting out the cover while it is still quite hot, 
leaving only about an inch-wide border of paste round tlie edge, and 
pouring over the apples when they have become cold, from half to three 
quarters of a pint of rich boiled custard. The cover divided into trian- 
gular sippets, was fonnerly stuck round the inside of the tart, but orna- 
mental leaves of pale puff-paste have a better effect. Well-drained 
whipped cream may be substituted for the custard, and piled high, and 
lightly over the fruit. 

BARBERRY TART. 

Barberries, with half their weight of fine brown sugar, when they are 
thoroughly ripe, and with two ounces more when they are not quite so, 
make an admirahle tart For one of moderate size, put into a dish bor- 
dered with paste, three quarters of a pound of barberries stripped from 
their stalks, and six ounces of sugar in alternate layers ; pour over them 
three tablespoonsful of water, put on the cover, and bake the tart for 
Half an hour. Another way of making it is, to line a shallow tin pan 
with very thin crust, to mix the fruit and sugar well together with a 
spoon, before they are laid in, and to put bars of paste across instead of 
a cover; or it may be baked without either.'*' 

ALMOND PASTE. 

For a sinHe dish of pastry, blanch seven ounces of fine sweet almonds 
and one of bitter ;f throw them into cold water as they are done, and 
let them remain in it for an hour or two ; then wipe, anld pound them 
to the finest paste, moistening them occasionally with a few drops of 
cold water, to prevent their oiling ; next, add to, and mix thoroughly 
with then, seven ounces of highly-refined, dried, and sifted sugar; put 
them into a small preserving-pan, or enamelled stewpan, and stir them 
over a clear and very gentle fire until they are so dry as not to adhere 

* Tbe French make their fruit-tarts generally thus, in large shallow pans. Plums, 
•plit and stMied (or if small kinds, left entire), cherries and currants freed fl-om the 
•talks, and various other fruits, all roiled in plenty of sugar, are baked in the unco v. 
ered crust ; or this is baked by itself, and then filled afterwards with fruit previously 
■tewed tender. 

1 When these are objected to, use half a pound of the sweet almondi.

to the finger when toached ; turn the paste immediately into an earthen 
pan or jar, and when cold it will be ready for use. 

Sweet almonds, 7 ozs. ; bitter almonds, 1 oz. ; cold water, 1 table- 
spoonful ; sugar, 7 ozs. 

Obs, — ^The pan in which the paste is dried should by no means be 
placed upon the fire, but high above it on a bar or trevet : should it be 
allowed by accident to harden too much, it must be sprinkled plentifully 
with water, broken up quite small, and worked, as it warms, with a 
strong wooden spoon to k smooth paste again. We have found this 
method perfectly successful ; but, -if time wiU permit, it should be mois- 
tened some hours before it is again set over the fire. 

TARTLETFS OF ALMOND PASTE. 

Butter slightlv the smallest-sized patty-pans, and line them with the 
almond-paste roiled as thin as possible ; cut it with a sharp knife close 
to their edges, 9.nd bake or rather dry the tartlets slowly at the mouth 
of a very cool oven. If at all coloured, they should be only of the 
palest brown ; but they will become perfectly crisp without losmg their 
whiteness if left for some hours in a very gently-heated stove or oven. 
They should be taken from the pans when two thirds done, and laid, 
reversed, upon a sheet of paper placed on a dish or board, before they 
are put back into the oven. At the instant of Serving, fill them with 
bright-coloured whipped cream, or with peach or apricot jam ; if the 
preserve be used, lay over it a small star or other ornament cut from 
the same paste, and dried with the tartlets. Sifted sugar, instead of 
fiour, must be dredged upon the board and roller in using almond paste. 
Leaves and fiowers formed of it, and dried gradually until perfectly 
crisp, will keep for a long time in a tin box or canister, and they form 
elegant decorations for pastrv. When a fluted cutter the size of the 
patty-pans is at hand, it will be an improvement to cnt out the paste 
with it, and then to press it lightly into them, as it is rather apt to 
break when pared off with a knifo. To colour it, prepared cochineal, 
or spinach-green, must be added to it in the mortar. 

MINCEMEAT ; (^AuthoT^s ReccijU.) 

To one pound of an unsalted ox-tongue, boiled tender and cut firee 
from the rind, add two pounds of fine stoned raisins, twoof beef kidney- 
suet, two pounds and a half of currants well cleaned and dried, two of 
good apples, two and a half of fine Lisbon sugar, from half to a whole 

{lound of candied peel according to the taste, the grated rinds of two 
arge lemons, and two more boiled quite tender, and chopped up entire- 
ly, with the exception of the pips, two small nutmegs, half an ounce 
of salt, a large teaspoonful of pounded mace, rather more of ginger in 
powder, half a pint of brandy, and as much good sherry or M»leira. 
Mince these ingredients separately, and mix the others all well before 
the bmndy and the wine are added ; press the whole into a jar or jars, 
and keep it closely covered. It should be stored for a few days before 
it is used, and will remain ^ood for Toaiiy weeks. Some persons like a 
slight fiavourmg of cloves m addition to the other spices ; others add 
the juice of two or three lemons, and a larger quantity of brandy. The 
inside of a tender and well-roasted sirloin of beef will answer quite as 
well as the tongue.

cold. Divide three quarters of a pound of good light crust into two 
equal portions ; roll out one quite thin and round, flour an oven-leaf 
and lay it on, as the tart cannot so well be moved after it is made ; 
place the apples upon it in the form of a dome, but leave a clear space 
of an inch or more round the ed^e ; moisten this with white of egg, 
and press the remaining half of the paste (which should be rolled out 
to the same size, and laid carefully over the apples) closely upon it: 
they should be well secured, that the symp from ^the fruit may not buj*st 
through. Whisk the white of an egg to a froth, brush it over the 
tart with a small bunch of feathers, sift sugar thickly over, and then 
strew upon it some almonds blanched and roughly chopped ; bake the 
tart in a moderate oven from thirty-five to forty-five minutes. It may 
be filled with peaches, or apricots, half-stewed, like the apples, or with 
cherries merely rolled in fine sugar; or with the pastry cream of 
page 267.

PUDDING PIES. (eNTREMBTS.) 

This form of pastry (or its name at least) is, we believe, peculiar to 
the county of Kent, where it is made in abundance, and eaten by all 
classes of people during Lent Boil for fifteen minutes three ounces of 
ground rice* in a pint and a half of new milk, and when taken from 
the fire stir into it three ounces of butter and four of sugar ; add to these 
six well-beaten eggs, a grain or two of salt, and a flavouring of nutmeg 
or lemon-rind at pleasure. When the mixture is nearly cold, line some 
large pattypans or some saucers with thin puff paste, fill them with it 
three parts full, strew the tops thickly with currants which have been 
cleaned and dried, and bake the pudding-pies from fifteen lo twenty 
minutes in a gentle oven.

Break carefully the shell of the nut, that the liquid it contains may 
not escape, f Take out the kernel, wash it in cold water, pare thinly 
off the dark skin, and grate the nut on a delicately clean bread-grater; 
put it, with its weight of pounded sugar, and its own milk, if not sour, 
or if it be, a couple of spoonsful or rather more of water, into a silver or 
.block-thi saucepan, or a very small copper stewpan perfectly tinned, 
and keep it gently stirred over a quite clear fire until it is tender : it 
will sometimes require an hour's stewing to make it so. When a little 
cooled, add to the nut, and beat well with it, some eggs properly whisked

Rasp the rind of a large lemon with four ounces of fine sugar, then 
crush, and mix it with the yolks of three eggs, and half the quantity of 
whites, well whisked; beat these together thoroughly; add to them 
four tablespoonsful of cream, a quarter of a potmd of oiled butter, the 
strained juice of the lemon, — which must be stirred quickly in by de- 
grees, — and a little orange-flower brandy. Line some pattypans with 
3iin pufi-paste,~half fill them with the mixture, and bake them thirty 
minutes in a moderate oven.

COMMON LEMON TABTLET8. 

Beat four eggs until they are exceedingly light, add to them gradually 
four ounces of pounded sugar, and whisk these togetlier for five minutes ; 
strew lightly in, if it be at hand, a dessertspoonful of potato-flour, if not, 
of common flour well dried and sifted ; then tlirow into the mixture, by 
dow degrees, three ounces of good butter, which should be dissolved, 
but only just luke-warm ; beat the whole well, then stir briskly in the 
strained juice and tlie grated rind of one lemon and a halfl Line sooie

CREME PATIS8IERE, OB PASTRY CREAM. 

To one ounce of fine flour add, very gradually, the beaten yolks of 
three fresh eggs ; stir to them briskly, and in small portions at first, 
three-quarters of a pint of boiling cream, or of cream and new milk 
mixed ; then turn the whole into a clean stewpan, and stir it over a 
very gentle fire until it is quite thick, take it off, and stir it well up and 
round ; replace it over the fire, and let it just simmer from six to eight 
minutes ; pour it into a basin, and add to it immediately a couple of 
ounces of pounded sugar, one and a half of fresh butter, cut small, or 
clarified, and a spoonml of the store-mixture of page 120, or a little 
sugar which has been rubbed on the rind of a lemon. The cream is 
rich enough for common use without further addition ; but an ounce and 
a half of ratifias, crushed almost to powder with a paste-roller improves 
it much, and they should be mixed with it for the receipt which follows.

the back of a knife, mark the paste into divisions of uniform size, bake 
it in a well-heated but not fierce oven for twenty minutes, or rather 
more, and cut it while it is still hot, where it is marked. The fanchon-

CHAPTER XVIL 
BOILED PUDDINGS. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 



All the ingredients for puddings should be fresh and of good quality. 
It is a false economy to use for them such as have been too long stored, 
as the slightest degree of mustiness or taint in any one of the articles 
of which they are composed will spoil all that are combined with it 
Eggs should alwayt be broken separately into a cup before they are 
thrown together in the same basin, as a sm^Ie very bad one will occa- 
sion the loss of many when this precaution is neglected. They should 
also be cleared from the specks with scrupulous attention, either with 
the point of a small three-pronged fork, while they are in the cup, or 
^ straining the whole through a fine hair-sieve after they are beaten. 
The perfect sweetness of suet and milk should be especially attended to, 
before they are mixed into a pudding, as nothing can be more ofiensive 
than the first when it is over-kept, nor worse in its efSscl than the curd- 
ling of the milk, which is the certain result of its being ever so slightly 
soured. 

Currants should be cleaned, and raisins stoned with exceeding care ; 
almonds and spices very finely poimded, and the rmds of oranges or 
lemons rasped or grated lightly ofi^ that tlie bitter part of the skin may 
be avoided, when they are used for this, or for any other class of dishes; 
if pared, they should be cut as tl^in as possible. 

Custard-puddings, to have a eood appearance, must be simmered only, 
but without ceasing ; for if boiled in a quick and careless manner, tlie 
surface, instead of being smooth and velvety, will be full of holes, or 
honey-combed, as it is called, and the whey will flow from it and min- 
gle with the sauce. • A thickly-buttered sheet of writinff-paper should 
be laid between the custard-mixture and the cloth, before it is tied 
over, or the lid of the mould is closed upon it; and the mould itself, or 
the basin in which it is boiled, and which should always be quite fbll, 
must likewise be well buttered ; and after it is lifleli frbm the water the 
pudding should be left in it for quite five minutes before it is dished, |o 
prevent its breaking or spreading about 

Batter is much lighter when ^iled in a cloth, and allowed fu^l room 
Xn swell, than when cooi^ned ip a nfoqld : it should be well bf^aten the 
uutant before it is poured into iU ftftd PUt ii^tp the wa^ef imi^ediately 
23^ 



970 ifODCRN oooKrair. C<3haf. xvn. 

after it icr secarely tied. The cloth should be moist and thickly floured, 
and the padding should be sent to table as expeditiously as possible 
after it is done, as it wilt quickly become heavy. This applies equally 
to all pudding made with paste, which are rendered uneatable by any 
delay in servmg them after they are ready: they should be opened a 
little at the top as soon as they are taken from the boiler or stewpan. 

Plum-puddings, which it is now customary to boil in moulds, are both 
lighter and less dry, when closely tied in stout cloths well buttered and 
floured, especially when they are made in part with bread ; but when 
this is done, care should be taken not to allow them to burn to the bot- 
tom of the pan in which they are cooked ; and it is a good plan to lay a 
plate or dish under them, by way of precaution against this mischance : 
It will not then so much matter whether they be kept floating or not. 
It is thought better to mix these entirely (except the liquid portion of 
them) the day before they are boiled, and it is perhaps an advantage 
when they are of large size to do so, but it is not really necessary tor 
small or common ones. 

A very little salt improves all sweet puddings, by taking ofi" the in- 
sipidity, and bringing out the full flavour of the other ingreidients, but 
its presence shotdd not be in the slightest degree perceptible. When 
brandy, wine, or lemon-juice is added to them it should be stirred in 
briskly, and by degrees, quite at last, as it would be likely otherwise to 
curdle the milk or eggs. 

Many persons prefer their puddings steamed ; but when this is not 
done, they should be dropped into plenty of boiling water, and be kepi 
well covered with it until they are ready to serve; and the boiling 
^ould never be allowed to cease for an instant, for they soon become 
heavy if it be interrupted. 

Pudding and dumpling cloths should not only be laid into plenty of 
water as soon as they are taken off, and washed afterwards, as we shall 
direct, but it is essential to their perfect sweetness that they should be 
well and quickly dried (in the open air if possible), then folded and kept 
in a clean drawer. We have known them left wet by a careless ser- 
vant, until when brought forward for use, they were as offensive almost 
as meet that had been too long kept To prevent their ever imparting 
sn unpleasant flavour when used, they should be washed in a ley made 
as follows; but when from any circumstance this cannot be done, and 
soap is used for them, they should be rinsed, and soaked in abundance 
of water, which should be changed several times. 

A LIE, OR LEY, FOB WASHING PUDDINQ-CLOTHS. 

To a pint of wood-ashes pour three quarts of boiling water, and either 
wash the cloths in the mixture without straining it, or give them two 
or three minutes boil in it first, then let the whole cool together; ^vash 
the cloths perfectly clean, and rinse them in abundance of water 
changing it several times : tliis both takes the grease ofl^ and renders 
them very sweet Two ounces of soda diseolv^ in a gallon of water 
will answer almost as well, providing the rinsing afterwards be care^ 
fully attended to. 

TO GI(EAN OUamANTS FOR PUDDINGS OR CAS3iS. 

Put them into a cullender, strew a handful of flour over them, and 
nib them, with the hands to separate the lumps, and to detach the sUdkB^ 



CHAP. XVn.] BOILBD FUDMHGB. 271 

work them round in the cuHender, and shake it well, when the BtnnXi 
Btalks and stones will fail tlirough it. Next pour plenty of cold water 
over the currants, drain, and spread them on a soft cloth, press it ovei 
them to absorb the moisture, and then lay them on a very clean oven* 
tin, or a large dish, and dry them very gradually (or they will become 
hard), either in a cool oven, or before the fire, taking care in the latter 
case that they are not placed sufficiently near it &r the ashes to ftU 
amongst them. When they are perfectly dry, clear them entirely fima 
the remaining stalks, and from every stone that may be amongst them. 
The best mode of detecting these is to lay the fhiit at the far end of a 
large white dish, or sheet of paper, and to pass it lightly, and in very 
small portions, with the fingers, towards oneself, examining it ckeely as 
this is done. 

TO MIX B4TTKR FOK PVDDIHOfl; 

Put the Hour and salt into a bowl, and stir them together : whisk the 
eggs thoroughly, strain them through a fine hair-sieve, and add them 
very gradually to the flour ; for if too much liquid be poured to it at 
once it will be full of lumps, and it is easy, with care, to keep the bat* 
ter perfectly smooth. Beat it well and lightly, with the beck of & 
strong, wooden spoon, and after the eggs are added, thin it with milk tc 
a proper consistency. The whites of the eggs beaten separately to & 
solid froth, and stirred gently into the mixture the instant before it is 
tied up for boiling, or before it is put into the oven to be baked, will 
render it remarkably light When fruit is added to the batter, it must 
be made thicker than when it is served plain, or it will sink to the bot- 
tom of the pudding. Batter should never stick to the knife when it is 
sent to tdble ; it will do this both when a sufficient number of eggs are 
not mixed with it, and when it is not enough cooked. About four eggs 
to the half-pound of flour will make it firm enough to cut smoothly. 

SUET-CnUST, FOB MEAT OB FRUIT PUDDINGS. 

Clear off the skin from some fresh beef kidney>suet, and with a sharp 
knife slice it thin, free it entirely from fibre, and mince it very fine : 
six ounces thus prepared will be found quite sufficient for a pound ot 
fiour. Mix them well together, add half a teaspoonful of salt for meat 
puddings, and a third as much for fruit ones, and sufficient cold water 
to make the whole into a very firm paste ; work it smooth, and roll it 
out of equal thickness when it is us^. The weight of suet should be 
taken after it is minced. This crust is so much lighter, and more whole* 
some than that which is made with butter, that we cannot refirain from 
recommending it in preference to our readers. Some cooks merely slice 
the suet in thm shavings, mix it with the flour, and beat the crust with 
a paste roller, until the flour and suet are perfectly incorporated. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; suet, 12 ozs. ; salt, 1 teaspoonful ; water, 1 pint 

BUTTEB CRUST FOR PUDDINGS. 

When suet is disliked for crust, butter must supply its place, but there 
must be no intermixture of lard in paste which is to be boiled. Eight 
ounces to the pound of flour will render it sufliciently rich for most eat- 
ers, and less will generally be preferred ; rich crust of this kind being 
more indigestible by far than that which is baked. The butter may be 
lightly broken into the flour before the water is added, or it may be laid

on, and rolled into the paste as for iraf^crast A small portion of salt 
must be added to it always, and for a meat pudding the same proportion 
as directed in the preceding receipt For kitchen, or for quite common 
&mily puddings, butter and clarified dripping are used sometimes in 
equal proportion& From three to four ounces of each will be sufficient 
for the pound and quarter of flour. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; butter, 8 ozs. ; salt, for fruit puddings, i saltspoonfiil ; 
for meat puddings, ^ teaspoonfiil. 

SMALL BEEF-STEAK PUDDING. 

Make into a very firm, smooth paste, one pound of flour, six ounces 
of beef-suet, finely minced, half a teaspoonfiil of salt, and half a pint of 
cold water. Line with this a basin which holds a pint and a half Sea- 
son a pound of tender steak, free from bone and skin, wit^ half an ounce 
of salt and half a teaspoonful of pepper well mixed together ; lay it in 
the crust, pour in a quarter-pint of water, roll out the cover, close the 
pudding carefiilly, tie a floured cloth over, and boil it three hours and a 
nal£ We give this receipt as an exact guide for the proportions of 
meat-puddings in general. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; suet, 6 ozs. ; salt, i teaspoonfiil; water, ^ pint; rump- 
steak, I lb.; salt, i oz.; pepper, ^ teaspoonful; water, i pint: 3 J 
hours. 

RUTH PINCH*S BEEFHSTEAK PUDDIIfO. 

To make Ruth PincKs celebrated pudding (known also as beefsteak 
pudding d la Dickens), substitute six ounces of butter for the suet in 
this receipt, and moisten the paste with the well-beaten yolks of four 
eggs, or with three whole ones, mixed with a little water; butter the 
basin very thickly before the crust is laid in, as the pudding is to be 
turned Ovit of it for table. In all else, proceed exactly as above. 

SUPERLATIVE BEEF-PUDDINO. 

Take a fine woodcock (or half a dozen rice-birds) that is ready for the 
spit, and put it into the middle of a large beef-pudding, laying the meat 
under, over, and round it ; finish it as usual, and boil it four hours or 
more : the fine flavour of the bird will pervade the whole contents of 
the pudding. 

MUTTON PUDDING. 

Mutton freed perfectly firom fat, and mixed with two or three sliced 
kidneys, makes an excellent pudding. The meat may be sprinkled 
with fine herbs as it is laid into the crust This will require rather less 
boiling than the preceding puddings, but it is made in precisely the 
same way. 

PARTRIDGE PUDDING. 

Skin a couple of well-kept partridges and cut them down into joints; 
line a deep basin with suet crust, observing the directions given in the 
preceding receipts ; lay in the birds, which should be rather highly sea- 
soned with pepper or cayenne, and moderately with salt ; pour in water 
for the gravy, close the pudding with care, and boil it from three hours 
to three and a half The true flavour of the game is admirably pre- 
served by this mode of cooking. When mushrooms are plentifiil, put a 
layer of buttons, or small flaps, cleaned as for pickling, alternately with 



CHAP. ZVn.3 BOILED PUDDING. 273 

8 layer of partridge, in filling the pudding, which will then be meet 
excellent eating : the crust may be left untouched, and merely emptied 
of its contents, where it is objected to ; or its place may be supplied 
with a richer one made of butter. A seasoning of pounded mace or 
nutmeg can be used at discretion. Puddings of veal, chickens, and 
young rabbits, may all be made by this receipt, or with the addition of 
oysters, which we have already noticed. 

COMMON BATTER PUDDING. 

Beat four eggs thoroughly, mix with them half a pint of milk, and 
pass them through a sieve, add tiiem by degrees to half a pound of flour, 
and when the batter is perfectly smooth, thin it with another half pint 
of milk. Shake out a wet pudding-cloth, flour it well, pour the batter 
in, leave it room to swell, tie it securely, and put it immediately into 
plenty of fiist-boiling water. An hour and ten minutes will boil it 
Send it to table the instant it is dished, with wine sauce, a hot compote 
of fruit, or raspberry vinegar : this last makes a delicious pudding sauce* 
Unless the liquid be add^ very gradually to the flour, and the mixture 
be well stirred and beaten as each portion is poured to it, the batter will 
not be smooth : to render it very light, a portion of the whites of the 
eggs, or the whole of them, should be whisked to a froth and stirred 
into it just before it is put into the cloth. 

Flour, ^ lb.; eggs, 4; salt, } teaspoonfbl; milk, 1 pint*. 1 hour and 
10 minutes. 

Obs, — Modem taste is in favour of puddings boiled in moulds, but, as 
we have already stated, they are seldom or ever so light as those which 
are tied in cloths only. Where appearance is the first consideratioUi 
we would recommend the use of the moulds, of course. 

ANOTHER BATTER PUDDING. 

Mix the yolfcs of three eggs smoothly with three heaped table8pooD»> 
ful of flour, thin the batter with new milk until it is of the consistency 
of cream, whisk the whites of eggs apart, stir them into the batter, and 
boil the pudding in a floured cloth or buttered basin for an hour. Before 
it is served, cut the top quickly into large dice, half through the pud- 
ding, pour over it a small jarful of fine currant, raspberry, or strawberry 
jelly, and send it to table without delay. 

Flour, 3 tablespoonsful ; eggs, 3 ; salt, ^ teaspoonful ; milk, from } to 
a whole pint : 1 hour. 

Obs. — For a very large pudding, double the quantity of ingredients 
And the time of boiling will be required. i 

BATTER FRUIT PUDDINO. 

Butter thickly a basin which holds a pint and a half, and fill it nearly 
to the brim with good boiling apples pared, cored, and quartered ; pour 
over them a batter made with four tablespoonsful. of flour, two large or 
three small eggs, and half a pint of milk. Tie a buttered and floured 
cloth over the basin, which ought to be quite full, and boil the pudding 
for an hour and a quarter. Turn it into a hot dish when done, and 
strew sugar thickly over it : this, if added to the batter at first, renders 
it heavy. Morel la cherries make a very superior pudding of tliis kind ; 
and green gooseberries, damsons, and various other fruits, answer for it 
extremely well : the time of boiling it must be varied according to their 
quality and its size. 



274 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAF. XVH. 

For a pint and a half mould or basin filled to the brim with apples or 
other fruit; flour, 4 tablespoon jful ; eggs, 2 large or three small; milk, 
^ pint: l^ hour. 

Obs. — ^Apples cored, halved, and mixed with a good batter, make an 
excellent baked pudding, as well as red currants, cherries, and plums 
of different sorts. 

ANOTHER 8VET PUDDING. 

Make into a somewhat lithe, but smooth paste, half a pound of fine 
stale bread-crumbs, three quarters of a pound of flour, from ten to twelve 
ounces of beef suet, chopped extremely small, a large half-teaspoonful 
of salt, and rather less of pepper, with two eggs and a little milk. Boil 
it two hours and a quarter. 

A CHEAP SVBT PI7DDINO. 

With a pound of flour mix well an equal weight of good potatoes 
boiled and grated (or prepared by Captain Kater*s receipt, page 230), a 
quarter pound of suet, and a small teaspoonful of salt. Make these into 
a stifi* batter, with milk, and boil the pudding one hour in a well-floured 
cloth. 

APPLE, CURRANT, CHERRY, OR OTHER FRESH FRUIT PUDDING. 

Make a paste as for a beaf-steak pudding, either with suet or butter ; 
lay into a basin a well-floured cloth, which has been dipped into hot 
water, wrung dry, and shaken out; roll the paste thin, press it evenly 
into the basin upon the cloth, fill it with apples, pared, cored, and quar- 
tered, or with any other fruit ; put on the cover, taking care to moisten 
the edges of the paste, to press them well together, and fold them over ; 
gather up the ends of the cloth, and tie it firmly close to the pudding, 
which should then be dropped into plenty of fast boiling water. When 
it is done, lift it out by twistinsf a strong fork into the corner of the 
cloth, turn it gently into the dish in which it is to be served, and cut 
immediately a small round or square from the top, or the pudding will 
quickly become heavy; send it to table without the slightest delay, 
accompanied by pounded, and by good Lisbon sugar, as many persons 
prefer the latter, from its imparting a more mellowed flavour to the 
fruit A small slice of fresh butter, and some finely grated nutmeg, are 
usually considered improvements to an apple pudding ; the juice, and 
the grated rind of a lemon may. be added with good eflect, when the 
fruit is laid into the crust, especially in spring, when the apples gene- 
rally will have become insipid in their flavour. When puddings are 
preferred boiled in moulds or basins, these must be thickly buttered 
before the paste is laid into them, and the puddiugs must be turned from 
them gently, that they may not burst. 

Currant, gooseberry, or cherry pudding, 1 to IJ hour. Greengage, 
damson, mussel, or other plum, 1 to 1^ hour. Apple pudding, mxa 1 
to 2 hours, according to its size, and the time of year. 

Obs. — ^If made of mellow fruit, an apple pudding will require only so 
much boiling as may be needed for the crust 

A COMMON APPLE PUDDING. 

Make a light crust with one pound of flour and six ounces of very 
finely minced beef-suet, roll it tiiin, and fill it with one pound and a 
quarter of good boiling apples; add the grated rind and strained juice 



CHAP. Xyn.3 BOILED PUDDINGS. 275 

of a small lemon, tie it in a cloth, and boil it one hour and twenty mi- 
nutes before Christmas, and from twenty to thirty minutes longer after 
Christmas. A small slice of fresh butter, stirred into it when it is 
sweetened, will, to many tastes, be an acceptable addition ; grated nut* 
meg, or a little cinnamon in fine powder, may be substituted for the 
lemon-rind when either is preferred. To convert this into a richer pud- 
ding, use half a pound of butter for the crust,- and add to the apples a 
spoonful or two of orange or quince marmalade. 

Crust: flour, 1 lb.; suet, 6 ozs. Fruit, pared and cored, 1} lb.; 
juice and rind of 1 small lemon (or some nutmeg or cinnamon in 
powder). 

Richer pudding : flour, 1 lb. ; butter, ^ lb. ; in addition to fruit, 1 or 
2 tablespoonsful of orange or quince marmalade. 

THE publisher's PUDDING. 

This pudding can scarcely be made too rick. First blanch, and then 
beat to the smoothest possible paste, six ounces of fresh sweet almonds, 
and a dozen bitter ones ; pour very gradually to them, in the mortar, 
three quarters of a pint of boiling cream ; then turn them into a cloth, 
and wring it from them again with strong expression. Heat a full half 
pint of it afresh, and pour it, as soon as it boils, upon four ounces of fine 
bread-crumbs, set a plate over, and leave them to become nearly cold ; 
then mix thoroughly with them four ounces of macaroons, crushed tole- 
rably small ; five of finely-minced bfeef-suet, five of marrow, cleared 
very carefully from fibre, and from the splinters of bone which are some- 
times found m it, and shred, not very small, two ounces of flour, six of 
pounded sugar, four of dried cherries, four of the best Muscatel raisins, 
weighed after they are stoned, half a pound of candied citron, or of 
citron and orange-rind mixed, a quarter saltspoonful of salt, half a nut- 
meg, the yolks only of seven full-sized eggs, the grated rind of a large 
lemon, and last of all, a glass of the best Cognac brandy, which must be 
stirred briskly in by slow degrees. Pour the mixture into a thickly 
buttered mould or basin,^ which contains a full quart, fill it to the brim, 
lay a sheet of buttered writing-paper over, then a well-floured cloth, tie 
them securely, and boil the pudding for four hours and a quarter ; let it 
stand for a couple of minutes before it is turned out; dish it carefully, 
and serve it with the German pudding sauce of page 112. 

Jordan almonds, 6 ozs. ; bitter almonds, 12 ; cream, } pint ; bread- 
crumbs, 4 ozs.; cream wrung from almonds, ^ pint; crushed maca- 
roons, 4 ozs. ; flour, 2 ozs. ; beef-suet, 5 ozs. ; marrow, 5 ozs. ; dried 
cheFries, 4 oz& ; stoned Muscatel raisins, 4 ozs. ; pounded sugar, 6 ozs. ;

i nutmeg; grated rind 1 lemon ; yolks of eggs, 7; best cognac, 1 wine- 
glassful : boiled in mould or basin, 4^ hours. 

Obs, — This pudding, which, if well made, is very light as well as 
rich, will be sufficiently good for most tastes without -the almonds, 
when they are omitted, the boiling cream must be poured at once tc 
the bread-crumbs.

it with wine sauce.

COMMON GWTABD PUDBINO. 

Whisk three egigrs well, put them into a pint basin, and add to them 
sufficient milk to fill it; then strain, flavour, and sweeten it with fine 
sugar ; boil the pudding very softly for an exact half hour, let it stand a 
few minutes, dish, and serve it with sugar sifted over, and sweet sauce 
in a tureen, or send stewed gooseberries, currants, or cherries to table 
with it A small quantity of lemon-brandy, or of ratafia can be added, 
to give it flavour, when it is made, or the sugar with which it is sweet- 
en^ may be rasped on a lemon or an orange, then crushed and dis- 
solved in the milk ; from an ounce and a half to two ounces will be 
sufficient for general taste. 

GERMAN PUDDING, AND SAUCE. 

Stew, until very tender and dry, three ounces of whole rice in a pint 
and a quarter of milk ; when a little cooled, mix with it three ounces 
of beef-suet, finely chopped, two ounces and a half of sugar, an ounce 
of candied orange or lemon-rind, six ounces of sultana raisins, and three 
large eggs well beaten and strained. Boil the pudding in a buttered 
basin, or in a well-floured cloth, for two hours and a quarter, and serve 
it with the following sauce: — Dissolve an ounce and a half of sugar 
broken small in two glasses of sherry, or of any other white wine, and 
stir them, when quite hot, to the beaten yolks of three fresh eggs; then 
stir the sauce in a small saucepan held hi^h above the fire until it re- 
sembles custard, but by no means allow it to boil, or it will instantly 
curdle ; pour it over the pudding, or, if preferred, send it to table in a 
tureen. We think a full teaspoonful of lemon-juice added to the wine 
an improvement to this sauce, which is excellent; and we can recom- 
mend the pudding also to our readers. 

Milk, 1| pint; rice, 3 ozs. : 1 hour^ or more. Suet, 3 oza; sugar, 
2 J ozs. ; candied peel, 1 oz. ; sultana raisins, 6 ozs. ; eggs, 3 large: 2|^ 
hours. Sauce : sherry, 2 glasses; sugar, 1^ oz. ; yolks of eggs, 3; lit- 
tle lemon-juice. 

We have already, in a previous part of the volume, directed that the 
German sauce should be milled to a fine froth, and poured upon the 
pudding with which it is served : when this is not done, the quantity 
should be increased. 

MISS bremer's pudding. 

Blanch, dry, and beat to the smoothest possible paste, half a pound 
of fresh Jordan almonds and five or six bitter ones, and moisten them 
as they are done with a few drops of water, or a little white of egg^ to 
prevent their oiling. Add to them in very small portions at first, or 
cliey will be lumpy, the yolks of seven fresh eggs, and the whites of 
two well beaten ; then throw in gradually four ounces of pounded and 
oiled sugar, and whisk the mixture thoroughly until it looks very light ; 



CHAP. XVII.3 BOILED PUDDINGS. S77 

next, strew in, continuing^ the whisking, fi>ur ounces of fine bread* 
crumbs, and the grated rind of a lemon; and last of all, add four ounces 
of justrliquid butter, which must, by no means, be heated more than 
enough to dissolve it, and which must be poured in by slow degrees, 
and beaten thoroughly to the other ingredients, until there is no ap- 
pearance of it lefl. Butter thickly a pint and a half mould, shake fine 
bread-crumbs thickly and equally over it, half fill it very gently with 
the pudding-mixture, and place lightly upon this a layer of apricot- 
jam ; put the remainder of the puddmg carefully upon it, lay a buttered 
paper over the mould, then close it, or should there be no cover, tie a 
cloth securely round it, and boil the pudding a full hour. Serve it with 
German, or common sweet wine sauce.

VERT GOOD RAISIN PUDDING. 

To three quarters of a pound of flour add four ounces of fine crumbs 
of bread, one pound of beefnsuet, a pound and six ounces of raisins, 
weighed after they are stoned, a quarter-teaspoonful of salt, rather more 
of ginger, half a nutmeg, an ounce and a half of candied peel, and 
four large or five small eggs, beaten, strained, and mixed with a cupful 
of milk, or as much more as will make the whole of the consistency of 
a very thick batter. Pour the mixture into a well-floured cloth of close 
texture, which has previously been dipped into hot water, wrung, and 
shaken out. Boil the pudding in plenty of water for four hours and a 
naif. It may b^ served with very sweet wine, or punch-sauce ; but if 
made as we have directed, will be much lighter than if sugar be mixed 
with the other ingredients before it is boiled ; and we have found it 
generally preferred to a richer plum-pudding.

little salt and ginger : 4^ hours. 

THE ELEGANT ECONOMIST'S PUDDING. 

Butter thickly a plain mould or basin, and line it entirely with slices 
of cold plum or raisin pudding; cut so as to join closely and neatly to- 
gether ; fill it quite with a gtxxl custard, lay, first a buttered paper, and 
then a floured cloth over it, tie them securely, and boil the pudding 
ffently for an hour ; let it stand for ten minutes after it is taken up 
before it is turned out of the mould. This is a more tasteful mode of 
serving the remains of a plum-pudding than the usual one of broiling 
them m slices, or converting them into fritters. The German sauce, 
well milled or frothed, is generally much relished with sweet boiled- 
puddings, and adds greatly to their good appearance ; but common wine, 
or punch-sauce, may be sent to table with the above quite as appro- 
priately.

sufficient size for a party of sixteen persons. We can voqch for its 
excellence, but as it is rather apt to break when turned oat of the cloth, 
a couple of eggs would perhaps improve it Sweetmeats, brandy, and 
spices, can be added at pleasure.

AN SXCELLENT SKAIX MDICJEMEAT PUDDING. 

Pour on an ounce, of bread-crumbs, sufiicient boiling milli to soak 
them well ; when they are nearly cold drain as much of it from them as 
you can, and mix them thoroughly with half a pound of mincemeat, a 
dessertspoonful of brandy, and three eggs beaten and strained. Boil 
the pudding for two hours in a well-buttered basin, which should be full, 
and serve it with sauce made with a little melted butter, half a glass of 
white wine, a tablespoonful of brandy, half as much lemon-juice, and 
sufficient sugar to make it tolerably sweet

THE author's CBRI8TMAS PUDDING. 

To three ounces of flour, and the same weight of fine, lightly-grated 
bread-crumbs, add six of beef kidney-suet, chopped small, su of raising 
weighed after they are stoned, six of well cleaned currants, four ounces 
of minced apples, five of sugar, two of candied orange-rind, half a tea* 
spoonful of nutmeg mixed with pounded mace, a very little salt, a small 
glasft.of brandy, and three whole eggs. Mix and beat these ingredi- 
ents well together, tie them tightly in a thickly floured cloth, and boil 
them for three hours and a halt We can recommend this as a remark* 
ably light small rich pudding: it may be served with German, wine, or 
punch sauce. 

Flour, 3 ozs. ; bread-crumbs, 3 ozs. ; suet, stoned rainns, and cur- 
rants, each, 6 ozs. ; minced apples, 4^oz8. ; sugar, 5 ozs. ; candied peel, 
2 ozs. ; spice, ^ teaspoonful ; salt, few grains; brandy, small wineglass- 
full ; eggs, 3 : 3^ hours. 

ROLLED PUDDING. 

Roll out thin a bit of light puff pAiste, or a good suet crust, and spread 
equally over it to within an inch of the edge, any kind of fruit jam. 
Orange marmalade and mincemeat make excellent varieties of this 
puddling, and a deep layer of fine brown sugar, flavoured with the grated 
rind and strained juice of one very large, or of two small lemons, an- 
swers for it extremely well. Roll it up carefully, pinch the paste toge- 
ther at the ends, fold a cloth round, secure it well at the ends, and boil 
the pudding from one to two hours, according to its size and the nature 
of the ingredients. Haifa pound of flour made into a paste with suet 
or butter, and covered with preserve, will be quite sufficiently boiled in 
an hour and a quarter. 

BREAD PUDDING. 

Sweeten a pint of new milk with three ounces of fine sugar, throw 
in a few grains of salt, and pour it boiling on half a pound of fine, and 
lightly-grated bread-crumbs ; add an ounce of fresh butter, and cover

them with a plate ; let them remain for half an hour or more, and then 
Btir to them four large well-whisked eggs, and a flavouring of nutmeg, 
or of lemon-rind ; pour the mixture into a thickly-buttered mould or 
basin, which holds a pint and a half^ and which ought to be quite full ; 
tie a paper and a cloth tightly over, and boil the pudding exactly an 
hour and ten minutes. This is quite a plain receipt, but by omitting 
two ounces of the bread, and adding more butter, one egg, a small glass 
of brand V, the grated rind of a lemon, and as much sugar as will sweeten 
the whole richly, a very excellent pudding will be obtained ; candied 
orange-peel also has a good efiect when sliced thinly into it; and half 
a pound of currants is generally considered a further improvement

BROWN BREAD PUDDING. 

To half a pound of stale brown bread, finely and lightly grated, add 
an equal weight of suet, chopped small, and of currants cleaned and 
dried, with half a saltspoonful of salt, three ounces of sugar, the third 
of a small nutmeg grated, two ounces of candied peel, five well-beaten 
eggs, and a glass of brandy. Mix these ingredients thoroughly, and 
boil the pudding in a cloth for three hours and a half. Send wine sauce 
to table with it The grated rind of a large lemon may be added with 
good efiect

A GOOD BOILED RICE PUDDING. 

Swell gradually,* and boil until quite soil and thick, faoT ounces and 
a half of whole rice in a pint and a half of new milk; sweeten them 
with from three to four ounces of sugar, broken small, and stir to them, 
while they are still quite hot, the grated rind of half a large lemon, four 
or five bitter almonds, pounded to a paste, and four large well-whisked 
eg^ ; let the mixture cool, and then pour it into a thickly buttered 
basin, or mould, which should be quite full ; tie a buttered paper and a 
floured cloth over it, and boil the pudding exactly an hour ; let it stand 
for two or three minutes before it is turned out, and serve it with sweet 
sauce, fruit syrup, or a compote of fresh fruit. An ounce and a half of 
candied orange-rind will improve it much, and a couple of ounces of 
butter may be added to enrich it, when the receipt without is considered 
too simple. It is excellent when made with milk highly flavoured with 
cocoanut (see Chapter XX). 

Whole rice, 4^ ozs.; new milk (or cocoa-nut-flavoured milk), lA

TOMATA BUMFUNGS, OR FDDDiNOB ; (nfi American Receipt,) 

** In the manner of composition, mode of cooking, and saucing, the 
good housewife must proceed iu the same way as she would for an apple 
dumpling, with this exception, care must be taken in paring the tomata 
not to extract the seed, nor break the meat in the operation of skinning 
it We have eaten tomatas raw without anything ; — cut up with pej^ 
per, salt, vine^r, and mustard ; — ^fried in butter and in lard ; — ^broiled 
and basted with butter ;•— stewed with and without bread, with cream 
and with butter ; — and, with a clear conscience, we can say, we like 
them in every way they have ever been fixed fw the palate ; but of 
all the modes of dressing them, known to us, we preter them when 
cooked in dumplings, for to us it appears that the steaming they receive 
in their dough-envelope increases in a very high degree that delicata 
spicy flavour which, even in their uncooked state, makes them such 
decided favourites with the epicure.'' 

0&«. — 1( is possible that the tomata^ which is, we know, abundantly 
grown and served in a great variety of forms .in America, may there» 
either from a difl^renCe d^ climate, or from some advantages of culture, 
be produced in greater perfection than with us, and possess really ^ the 
delicate spicy flavour" attributed to it in our receipt, but which we can- 
not say we have ever yet discovered here ; nor have we put its excel- 
lence for paddings to the proof, though some of our readers may like to 
do so. 

FASHIONABLE APPLE DVMPLINOS. 

These are boiled in small knitted or closely-netted cloths (the former 
have, we think, the prettiest effect), which give quite an ornamental 
appearance to an otherwise homely dish. Take out the cores without 
dividing the apples, which should be large, and of a good boiling sort, 
and flll the cavity with orange or lemon marmalade, enclose them in a 
good crust rolled thin, draw the cloths round them, tie them closely and 
boil them for three quarters of an hour. Lemon dumplings may be 
boiled in the same way. 

j to 1 hour, if the apples be not of the best boiling kind. 

ORANGE SNOW-BALLS. 

Take out the unhusked grains, and wash well half a pound of rice; 

put it into plenty of water, and boil it rather quickly for ten minutes; 

drain and let it cool. Pare four large, or five small oranges, and clear 

from them entirely the thick white inner skin ; spread the rice, in as 

many equal portions as there are oranges, upon some pudding or 

dnmpling-clotns ; tie the fruit separately in these, and boil the snow-

balls for an hour and a half; turn them carefully on to a dish, and strew 
plenty of sifted sug^r over them. 
Rice, 8 ozs. ; oranges, 5:1^ hour. 

APPLE SNOW-BALL8. 

Pare and core some large pudding-apples, without dividing them, 
prepare the rice as in the foregoing receipt, enclose them in it, and boil 
them for an hour : ten minutes less will be sufficient should the fruit be 
but of moderate size. An agreeable addition to them is a slice of fresh 
butter, mixed with as much sugar as can be smoothly blended with it, 
and a flavouring of powdered cinnamon, or of nutmeg : this must be 
sent to table apart from them, not in the dish. 

LIGHT CURRANT DUXPUN08. 

For each dumpling take three tablespoonsful of flour, two of finely- 
minced suet, and three of currants, a slight pinch of salt, and as much 
milk or water as will make a thick batter of the ingredients. Tie the 
dumplings in well-floured cloths, and boil them for a full hour: they may 
be served with very sweet wine-sauce. 

LEMON DUHPUNOS. 

Mix, with ten ounces of fine bread-crumbs, half a pound of beef-suet, 
chopped extremely small, one large tablespoonful of flour, the grated 
rinds of two small lemons, or of a very large one, four ounces of pounded 
sugar, three large, or four small eggs beaten and strained, and last of 
all the juice of the lemotis, also strained. Divide these into four equal 
portions, tie them in well-floured cloths, and boil them an houn The 
dumplings will be extremely light and delicate; if wished very sweet 
more sugar must be added to them. 

SWEET BOILED PATTIES. (OOOD.) 

. Mix into a very smooth paste, three ounces of finely-minced suet, 
with eight of flour, and a slight pinch of salt; divide it Into fourteen 
balls of equal size, roll them out quite thin and round, moisten the 
edges, put a little preserve into each, close the patties very securely to 
prevent its escape, throw them into a pan of boiling water, and in from 
ten to twelve minutes lifl them out, and serve them instantly. Butter* 
crust may be used for them instead of suet, but it will not be so light. 

Flour, 8 ozs. ; suet, 3 ozs. ; Utile salt ; divided into fourteen portions : 
boil 10 to 12 minutes. 

BOILED RICE TO BE SERVED WITH STEWED FRUITS, PRESERVES, OR 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

Take out the discoloured grains from half a pound of good rice; and 
wash it in several waters ; tie it very loosely in a pudding-cloth and 
boil it for three-quarters of an hour ; it will then be quite solid, and 
resemble a pudding in appearance. Suflicient room must be given to 
allow the grain to swell to its full size, or it will be hard ; but too much 
space will render the whole watery. With a little experience the cook 
will easily ascertain the exact degree to be allowed for it. Pour ounces 
of rice will require quite half an hour's boiling ; a little more or less of 
time will sometimes be needed, from the diflerence of quality in the 
grain. ^

CHAPTER XVIIL 
BAKED PUDDINGS. 

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 

We have little to add here to the remarks which will be fband at the 
commencemeat of the preceding Chapter, as they will apply equally to 
the preparation of these and of boiled piiddingfs. 

All of the custard kind, whether made of eggs and milk only, or of 
sago, arrow-root, rice, ground or in fifrain, veraiicelli, &c., require a 
very gentle oven, and are spoiled bjr mst-baking. Those made of bat- 
ter, on the contrary, should be put into one sufficiently brisk to raise 
them quickly, but without scorching them. Such as contain suet and 
raisins must have a well-heated, but not a fierce oven ; for as they must 
remain long in it to be thoroughly done, unless carefully managed, they 
will either be much too highly coloured, or too dry. 

By whisking to a solid froth the whites of the eggs used for any pud- 
ding, and stirring them softly into *it at the instant of placing it in the 
oven, it will be rendered exceedingly light, and will rise very high in 
the dish ; but as it will partake then of the nature of a s<mffley it must 
be despatched with great expedition to table from the oven, or it will 
become flat before it is served. 

When a pudding is sufficiently browned on the sur&ce (that is to say, 
of a fine equal amber-colour) before it is baked through, a sheet of writ- 
ing paper should be laid over it, but not before it is set : when quite firm 
in the centre^ it will be done. 

Potato, batter, plum, and every other kind of pudding indeed, which 
is sufficiently solid to allow of it, should be turned reversed on to a clean 
hot dish from the one in which it is baked, and strewed with sifted sugar, 
before it is sent to table. 

Minute directions for the preparation and management of each par- 
ticular variety of pudding will be found in the receipt for it. 

THE printer's PUDDING. 

Grate very lightly six oimces of the crumb of a stale loaf, and put it 
into a deep dish, bissolve in a quart of cold new milk four ounces of 
good Lisbon sugar ; add it to five large, well-whisked eggs ; strain, and 
mix them with the bread-crumbs ; stir in two ounces of a fresh finely- 
grated cocoa-nut; add a fiavouring of nutmeg or of lemon-rind, and the 
slightest pinch of salt; let H^e puddinsf stand for a couple of hours to 
soak the bread ; and bake it in a gentle oven for three quarters of an 
hour: it is excellent if carefully made, and not too quickly baked. 
When the cocoa-nut is not at hand, an ounce of butter just dissolved, 
should be poured over the dish before the crumbs are put into it; and 
the rind of an entire lemon may be used to j^ive it flavour ; but the 
cocoa-nut imparts a peculiar richness when it is good and fresh. 

Bread-crumbs, 6 ozs. ; new milk, 1 quart ; sugar, 4 ozs. ; e^gs, 5 ; 
cocoa-nut, 2 ozs. ; (or rind, 1 large lemon, and 1 oz. butter) slightest 
pinch of salt : to stand 2 hours. &ked in gentle oven full ^ hour. 

Obs. — When a very sweet pudding is liked, the proportion of sugar 
may be increased.

ALMOND PUDDING. 

On two ounces of fine white bread-crumbs pour a pint of boiling 
cream, and let them remain until nearly cold, then mix them very g^- 
dually with half a pound of sweet and six bitter almonds pounded to the 
smoothest paste, with a little orange-flower water, or, when this is not 
at hand, with a few drops of spring water, iust to prevent their oiling ; 
stir to them by degrees the well-l^ten yolks of seven and the whites 
erf* three e^gs, six ounces of sifted sugar, and four of clarified butter ; 
turn the mixture into a very clean stewpan, and stir it without ceasing 
over a slow fire until it becomes thick, but on no account allow it to 
boil. When it is tolerably cool add a fflass of brandy, or half a one of 
noyeau, pour the pudding into a dish lined with very thin pufiT paste, 
and bake it half an hour m a moderate oven. 

Bread-cnimbs, 2 ozs. ; cream, 1 pint ; pounded almonds, i lb. ; bitter 
almonds, 6 ; yolks of 7, whites of 3 eggs ; sugar, 6 ozs. ; butteir, 4 ozs. ; 
brandy, 1 winegUuasful, or i glass of noyeau : i hour, moderate oven. 

AN EXCEIXENT LEMON PUDDING. 

Beat well together four ounces of fi'esh butter, creamed, and eight of 
nfted sugar ; to these add mdually'tbe yolks of six and the whites of 
two eggs, with the grated rind and the strained juice of one large 
lemon : — this hiSt must be added by slow degrees^ and stirred briskly to 
the other ingredients. Bake the pudding in a dish lined with very thin 
pufi^paste for three-quarters of an hour, in a slow oven. 

Butter, 4 oza; sugar, | Ibi; yolks of 6, whites of 2 eggs; large 
kmon, 1 : j hour, slow oven, 

ANOTHER LEMON PUDDING; (gOOd*) 

Stir over a slow fire until they boil. Soar ounces and a half c^ butter 
with seven ounces of pounded sugar, then pour them into a dish and let 
them remain until cold, or nearly so. Mix very smoothly a large des« 
sertspoonful of flour with six eggs that have been whisked and strained ; 
add these gradually to the sugar and butter, with the grated rinds and 
the juice of two moderate-sized lemons ; put a border or a lining of 
pufl-paste to the pudding, and bake it for an hour in a gentle oven. 

Butter, 4^ ozs. ; sugar, 7 ozs. ; flour, 1 large dessertspoonful ; eggs, 
6'; lemons, 2: 1 hour, gentle oven. 

Obs. — ^The proportion of butter in these puddings is less than is com- 
monly used for them, but a larger quantity renders them so unwhole- 
Bomely rich that they are usually preferred with less. When a very 
powerful flavour of the fi*uit is liked, an additional lemon may be used 
in either of these receipts. The rinds may be rasped on part of the 
angar, instead of being grated. A couple of sponge-biscuits soaked in 
cream, then pressed dry, and very finely bruised, can be substituted &r 
the flour. 

LKMON SUBT-PUDDINO. 

To eight ounces of finely-grated bread-crumbs, add six of fi-esh beef 
kidney-suet, fi-ee from skin, and minced very small, three and a half of 
pounded sugar, six ounces of currants, the grated rind and the strained 
juice of a large lemon, and four full-sized or five small well-beaten 
^gg^> P9ur these ingredients into a thickly-buttered pan, aiid bake 
the piiddmg for an hour in a brisk oven, but draw it towards the mouth

when it is of a fine brown colour. Turn it from the dish be&re it ia 
served, and strew sifled susfar over it or not, at pleasure : two ounces 
more of suet can be added^ when a larger proportion is liked. The 
pudding is very good without the currants. 

BresSl-crumbs, 8 ozs. ; beef-suet, 6 ozs. ; pounded sugar, S} ozs.; 
lemon, 1 large ,* currants, 6 ozs. ; eggs, 4 large, or 5 small : 1 hour, 
brisk oven. 

BAKEWELL PUDDING. 

This pudding is famous not only in Derbyshire, but in several othei 
English counties, where it is usually served on all holiday-occasions. 
Line a shallow tart-dish with quite an inch-deep layer of several kind& 
of good preserves mixed together, and intermingle with them from two 
to three ounces of candied citron or orange-rind. Beat well the yolks 
often eggs, and add to them gradually half a pound of sifted sugar; 
when they are well mixed, pour in by degrees half a pound of good 
clarified butter, and a little ratafia or any other flavour that may be 
preferred ; fill the dish two-thirds full with this mixture, and bake the 
pudding for nearly an hour in a moderate oven. Half the quantity will 
be sufficient for a small dish. * 

Mixed preserves, 1^ to 2 lbs. ; yolks of eggs, 10; sugar, ^ lb. ; bat- 
ter, i lb. ; ratafia* lemon-brandy, or other flavouring to the taste : Inked, 
moderate oven, f to 1 hour. 

Obs. — ^This is a rich and expensive, but not a very refined pudding. 
A variation of it, known in the south as an Alderman's Pudding, is, we 
think, superior to it It is made without the candied peel, and with a 
layer of apricot-jam only, six ounces of butter, six of sugar, the yolks 
of six, and the whites of two eggs. 

THE ELEGANT ECONOMIST'S PUDDING. 

We have already given a receipt for an exceedingly good boiled pud* 
ding bearing this title, but we think the baked ofte answers even bet- 
ter, and it is made with rather more facility. Butter a deep tart-dish 
well, cut the slices of plum-pudding to join exactly in lining it, and 
press them against it lightly to make them adhere, as without this pre- 
caution they are apt to float off; pour in as much custard (previously 
thickened and left to become cold), or any other sweet pudding mixture 
as will fill the dish almost to the brim ; cover the top with thin slices 
of the plum pudding, and bake it in a slow oven from thirty minutes to 
a full hoar, according to the quantity and quality of the contents. One 
pint of new milk poured boiling on an ounce and a half of fous les mot>, 
smoothly mixed with a quarter pint of cold milk, makes with the addi- 
tion ofumr ounces of sugar, four small eggs, a little lemon-grate, and, 
two or three bitter almonds, or a few drops of ratafia, an excellent pud- 
ding of this kind ; it should be baked nearly three quarters of an hour 
in a quite slack oven. Two ounces and a half of arrow-root may be 
used m lieu of the tous les mois, when this last is not procurable. We 
would especially recommend for trial the ingredients of the lemon- 
pudding of page .284, (second receipt), with the plum-pudding crust, as 
likely to make a very superior variety of this dish ; we have not had it 
tested, but think it could scarcely fiiil. It must be well, though slowly 
baked.

UCH BREAD AND BDTTER PVDDINO. 

Give a good flavour of lemon-rind and bitter almonds, or of cinna- 
mon, if preferred, to a pint of new milk, and when it has simmered a 
sufficient time for this, strain and mix it with a quarter-pint of rich 
cream; sweeten it with four ounces of su^r in lumps, and stir while 
still hot to five well-beaten egga; throw m a few grains of salt, and 
move the mixture brisklv with a spoon as a glass of brandf is added to 
it. Have re»dy in a thiokly-buttered dish three layers of thin bread 
acd (gutter cut from a half-quartern loaf, with four ounces of currants, 
and one and a half of finely shred candied peel, strewed between and 
over them; pour the eggs and milk on them bv degrees, letting the 
bread a^isorb one portion before another is added : it should soak for a 
couple of hours before the pudding- is taken to the oven, which should 
be a moderate one. Half an hour will bake it It is very good when 
made with new milk only ; and some persons use no more than a pint 
of liquid in all, but part of the whites of the eggs may then be omitted. 
Cream may be substituted for the entire quantity of milk at pleasure. 

New milk, 1 pint; rind of small lemon, and 6 bitter almouds bruised

COMMON BREAD AND BIPTTBR FUDDINO. 

Sweeten a pint and a half of milk with four ounces of Lisbon sugar; 
•tir it to four large well-beaten eggs, or to five small ones, grate half a 
nutmeg to them, and pour the mixture into a dish which holds nearly 
three pints, and which is filled almost to the brim with layers of bread 
and butter, between which three ounces of currants have been stye wed. 
IfOmon-grate, or orange-flower water can be added to this pudding in- 
stead of nutmeg, when preferred. From three quarters of an hour to 
an hour will bake it

A GOOD BAKED BREAD PUDDINQ. 

Pour, quite boiling, on six ounces (or three quarters of a pint) of fine 
bread-crumbs and one ounce of butter, a pint of new milk, cover them 
closely, and let them stand until the bread is well soaked ; then stir to 
them three ounces of sugar, five eggs, leaving out two of the whitasi 
two ounces of candied orange-rind* sliced thin, and a flavouring of nut- 
meg ; when the mixture is nearly or quite cold pour it into a dish, and 
place lightlj^ over the top the whites of three eggs beaten to a firm 
froth, and mixed at the instant with three large tablespoonsful of sifl-ed 
sugar. Bake the pudding half an hour in a moderate oven. The icing 
may be omitted, and an ounce and a half of butter, just warmed, put 
into the dish before the pudding, and plenty oi sugar, sifl^ed over it just 
ijU3 it is sent to the oven.

them four ounces of sugar, six ounces of curfants, one and a half of 
eandied orange or citron, and five eggs. 

SUTHERLAND OR CASTLE PUDDINGS. 

Take an equal weight of eggs in the shell, of good butter, of fine 
dry flour, and of sifted sugar. First, whisk the eggs for ten minutes, 
or until they appear extremely light; then throw in the sugar by 
degrees, and OMitinue the whisking for four or five minutes; next, 
strew in the flour, also gradually, and when it appears smoothly blended 
with the other ingredients, pour the butter to them in small portions, 
each of which stxHild be beaten in until there is no appeailEince of it 
left It should previously be just liquefied with the least possible degree 
of heat ; this may be OTOcted by putting it into a well-warmed sauce- 
pan, and shaking it round until it is dissolved. A grain or two of salt 
should be thrown in with the flour ; and the rind of half a fine lemon 
rasped on sugar, or grated, if more convenient, or some pounded mace, 
or the store-flavouring of page 11^, can be added at choice. Pour the 
mixture^ directly it is ready, into well-buttered cups, and bake the pud- 
dings from twenty to twenty-five minutes. When cold, they resemble 
good pound-cakes, and may be served as such. Wine sauce should be 
sent to table with them. 

Eggs* 4; their weight in flour, sugar, and butter; lUtle salt; flavour- 
ing of pounded mace or lemon-rind. 

Obs, — Three e^gs are sufficient for a small dish of these puddings. 
They may be vari^ with an ounce or two of candied citron ; or with a 
spoon fill of brandy, or a little orange flower water. The mode we have 
^iven of making them will be found perfectly successful if our direc- 
tions be followed with exactness. . In a slack oven they will not be too 
fiiuch baked in half an hour. 

MADELEINE PUDDINGS; (to be scfved cold.) 

Take the same ingredients as for the Sutherland pudddings, but cla- 
rify an additional ounce of butter ; skim, and then fill some round tin 
pattypans with it almost to the brim, pour it from one to the other until 
.all have received a sufficient coating to prevent the puddings from ad- 
hering to them, and leave half a teaspoonful in each ; mix tlie remainder 
with the eggs, sugar, and flour, beat the whole up very lightly, fill.the 
pans about two thirds full, and put them directly into a rather brisk 
oven, but draw them towards the mouth of it when they are sufficiently 
coloured ; from fifteen to eighteen minutes will bake them. Turn them 
out, and drain them on a sheet of paper. When they are quite cold, 
with the point of the knife take out a portion of the tops, hollow tlie 
puddings a little, and fill them with rich apricot-jam, well mixed with 
half its weight of pounded almonds, of which two m every ounce should 
be bitter ones. 

A FRENCH RICE PUDDING, OR GATEAU DE RIZ. 

Swell gently in a quart of new milk, or in equal parts of milk and 
cream, seven ounces of the best Carolina rice, which has been cleared 
of the discoloured grains, and washed and drained ; when it is tolerably 
tender, add to it three ounces of fresh butter, and .five of sugar roughly 



288 MODERN COOKSR¥. [cHAP. ZYin. 

powdered, a fern grains of salt, and the lightly grated rind of a fine 
lemon, and simmer the whole until the rice is swollen to the utmost ; 
then take it from the fire, let it cool a little, and stir to it quickly, and 
by degrees, the well-beaten yolks of six full-sized eggs. Pour mto a 
small copper stewpan* a dbuple of ounces of clarified butter, and incline 
it in such a manner that it may receive an equal coating in every part ; 
then turn it upside down for an instant, to drain off the superfluous but- 
ter; next, throw in some exceedingly fine light crumbs of stale bread, 
and shake them entirely over it, turn out those which do not adhere, 
and with a small brush or feather sprinkle more clarified butter slightly 
on tliose which line the pan. Whisk quickly the whites of the eggs to 
snow, stir them gently to the rice, and pour the mixture softly into the 
Btewpan, that the bread-crumbs may not be displaced ; put it immedi- 
ately into a moderate oven, and let it remain m a full hour. It will 
then, if properly baked, turn out from the mould or pan well browned, 
quite firm, and having the appearance of a cake; but a fierce heat will 
cause it to break, and present an altogether unsightly appearance. In 
a very slack oven, a longer time must be allowed for it. 

New milk, or milk and cream, 1 quart ; Carolina rice, Tozs. : | hour. 
Fresh butter, 3 ozs. ; sugar, in lumps, 5 ozs. ; rind, 1 large lemon : j to 
1^ hour. Eggs, 6: baked in a moderate oven, 1 hour. 

'Obn, — An admirable variety of this g&teau is made with cocoa-nut 
flavoured milk, or cream (see Chapter XX.), or with either of these 
poured boiling on six ounces of Jordan almonds, finely pounded, and 
mixed with a dozen of bitter ones, then expressed from them with 
strong pressure ; it may likewise be flavoured with vanilla, or with 
candied orange-blossoms, and covered, at the instant it is dished, with 
strawberry, apple, or any other clear jelly. 

A COMMON RICE PUDDING. 

Throw six ounces of rice into plenty of cold water, and boil it gently 
from eight to ten minutes ; drain it well in a sieve or strainer, and put 
it into a clean saucepan with a quart of milk ; let it stew until tender, 
sweeten it with three ounces of sugar, stir to it, gradually, three large, 
or four small eggs, beaten and strained ; add grated nutmeg, lemon* 
rind, or cinnamon, to give it flavour, and bake it one hour in a gentle 
oven. 

Rice, 6 ozs. ; in water, 8 to 10 minutes. Milk, 1 quart: j to 1 hour. 
Su^r, 3 ozs. ; eggs, 3 large, or 4 small ; flavouring of nutmeg, lemon- 
rind, or cinnamon : bake 1 hour, gentle oven. 

RICHER RICE POTODINO. 

Pick and wash very clean four ounces of whole rice, pour on it a 
pint and a half of new milk, and stew it slowly till quite tender ; be- 
fore it is taken from the fire, stir in two ounces of good butter, and three 
of sugar ; and when it has cooled a little, add four well-whisked eggs, 
and the grated rind of half a lemon. Bake the pudding in a gentle 
oven from thirty to forty minutes. As rice requires long boiling to ren- 
der it sof^ in milk, it may be partially stewed in water, the quantity of

milk diminished to a pint, and a little tiiick sweet cream mixed with it* 
before the other ingredients are added. 

Rice, 4 ozs. ; new milk, 1^; butter, 2 ozs. ; sugar, 3 ozs. ; egga, 4; 
rind of ^ lemon : 30 to 40 minutes, slow oven. 

BICE-PUDDINO MEBINOUi. 

Swell gently four ounces of Carolina rice in a pint and a quarter of 
milk or of thin cream ; let it cool a little, and stir to it an ounce and a 
half of butter, three of pounded sugar, a grain or two of salt, the grated 
rind of a small lemon, and the yolks of four large, or of five small eggs. 
Pour the mixture into a well-buttered dish, and ky lightly and equally 
over the top the whites of four eggs, beaten as for sponge-cakes, and 
mixed at the instant with from four to five heaped tablespoonsfbl of 
sifted sugar. Bake the pudding half an hour in a moderate oven, but 
do not allow the meringue to l^ too deeply coloured ; it should be of 
clear brown, and very crisp. Serve it directly it is taken from the oven. 

Rice, 4 ozs. ; milk, or cream, 1^ pint; butter, 1| oz. ; sugar, 3 ozs. ; 
rind, 1 lemon ; yolks of e^gs, 4 or 5 ; the whites beaten to snow, and 
mixed with as many tablespoonsful of sifted sugar: baked i hour, 
moderate oven. 

Obs. — ^A couple of ounces of Jordan almonds, witl^ six bitter onea, 
pounded quite to a paste, will improve this dish, whether mixed with the 
pudding itself, or with the meringue. 

GOOD GROUND RICB PUDDINO. 

Mix very smoothly five ounces of flour of rice (or of ground rice, if 
preferred), with half a pint of milk, and pour it into a pint and a half 
more which is boiling fast ; keep it stirred constantly over a gentle fire 
fron^ ten to twelve minutes, and be particularly careful not to let it burn 
to the pan ; add to it before it is taken from the fire, a quarter of a pound 
of good butter, from five to six ounces of sugar, roughly powderea, and 
a half-saltspoonful of salt; turn it into a pan, and stir it for a few 
minutes, to prevent its hardening at the top ; then mix with it, by de- 
grees, but quickly, the yolks of eight eggs, and the whites of only two, 
Uie grated or rasped rind of a fine lemon, and a glass of brandy. Lay 
a border of rich paste round a buttered dish, pour in the pudding, strain 
a little clarified outter over the top, moisten the paste with a brush, or 
small bunch of feathers dipped in cold water, and sift plenty of sugar on 
it, but less over the pudding itself. Send it to a very gentle oven to be 
baked for three-quarters of an hour. 

Rice-flour (or ground rice), 5 ozs. ; new milk, 1 quart : 10 to 13 
minutes. Butter, 4 ozs. ; sugar, 5 to 6 ozs. ; salt, i saltspoonful ; yolka, 
3 eggs; whites, 2; rind, 1 large lemon; brandy, large winegla^sful : } 
hour, alow oven. 

06«.-r-These proportions are sufficient for a pudding of larger size 
than those served usually at elegant tables ; they will make two small 
ones ; or two-thirds of the quantity may be taken for one of moderate 
si^e. Lemon-brandy or ratafia, or a portion of each, may be used to 
give it flavour, with good efi^ect ; and it may be enriched, if this be de- 
sired, by adding to the other ingredients from three to four ounces of 
Jordan almonds, finely pounded, and by substituting craam for half of 
the milk.

COMMON OBOVIID-BICE PUDDIITO. 

One pint and a half of milk, three ounces and a half of rice, three 
of Lisbon sugar, one and a half of butter, some nutmeg, or lemon-grate, 
and four eggs, baked slowly for half an hour, or more, if not quite firm. 

F0TATO-PU]>DIlfO. 

With a pound and a quarter of fine mea];^ potatoes, boiled very dry, 
jind mashed perfectly smooth while hot, mix three ounces of butter, 
five and a half of sugar, ^\e eggs, a few grains of salt, and the grated 
rind of a small lemon. Pour the mixture mto a well-buttered di£, and 
bake it in a moderate oven for nearly three-quarters of an hour. It 
should be turned out and sent to table with fine sugar sifted over it ; or 
for variety, red currant-jelly, or any other preserve may be spread on it 
as soon as it is dished. 

Potatoes, 1^ lb. ; butter, 3 ozs. : sugar, 5^ ozs. ; eggs, 5; lemon-rind, 
1 ; salt, few grains : 40 to 45 minutes. 

Obs. — When cold, this pudding eats like cake, and may be served as 
such, omitting, of course, the sugar or preserve when it is dished. 

A RICHER POTATO PUDBINO. 

Beat well together fourteen ounces of mashed potatoes, four ounces 
of butter, four df fine sugar, five eg^gs, the s^rated rind of a small lemoi^ 
and a slight pinch of salt ; add half a glass of brandy, and pour the 
pudding into a thickly-buttered dish, ornamented with slices of candied 
orange or lemon rind ; pour a little clarified butter on the top, and then 
^ft plenty of white sugar over it 

Potatoes, 14 ozs. ; butter, 4 ozs. ; sugar, 4 ozs. ; eggs, 5 ; lemon-rind, 
1; little salt; brandy, ^ glassfiil; candied peel, Ij^ to 2 ozs.: 40 
minutes. 

Obs. — The potatoes for these receipts should be lightly and carefiilly 
mashed, but never pounded in a mortar, as that will convert them into 
a heavy paste. The better plan is to prepare them by Captain Kater's 
receipt (page 230), when they will fiill to powder almost of themselves; 
or they may be grated while hot through a wire-sieve. From a quarter 
to a half pint of cream is, by many cooks, added to potato puddings. 

AN EXCELLENT SPONGE CAKE PITDDINO. 

Slice into a well-buttered tart-dish three penny sponge cakes, and 
place on them a couple of ounces of candied orange or lemon-peel cut 
in strips. Whisk thoroughly six eggs, and stir to them boiling a pint 
and a quarter of new milk, m which three ounces of sugar have been 
dissolved ; grate in the rind of a small lemon, and when they are some- 
what cooled, add half a wineglassful of brandy ; while still warm, pour 
the mixture on to the cakes, and let it remain an hour ; then strain an 
ounce and a half of clarified butter over the top, sift or strew pounded 
sugar rather thickly on it, and bake the pudding for half an hour in a 
moderate oven. 

Sponge cakes, 3; candied peel, 2 ozs.; eggs, 6; new milk, 1} pint; 
sugar, 3 ozs. ; lemon-rind, 1 ; brandy, ^ glass ; butter, 1 oz. ; siiled 
F?ngaT, a oz. : i hour. 

THE DUCHESSES PUDDING. 

Mix with half a pound of potatoes very smoothly mashed, three ipiar*

ters of a poand of #iificemeat, the grated rind of half a lemon, a des- 
sertspoonAil of sugar, and four large, or five small eggs; pour the whole 
into a well-buttered dish, and put over the top clarified butter and sugar, 
as in the preceding receipt. Bake the pudding for a full hour and 
twenty minutes. 

Potatoes, i lb. ; mincemeat, | lb. ; rind of lemon, ^ ; sugar, 1 des- 
sertspoonful ; eggs, 4 large, or 5 small : 1 hour 20 minutes. 

BAKED APPLE PVDDIHCS C» CUSTARD. 

Weigh a pound of good boiling apples after they are pared and 
cored, and stew them to a perfectly smooth marmalade, with six ounces 
bi sugar, and a spoonful or two of water: stir them often that they may 
not stick to the pan. Mix with them while they are still quite hot, 
tlnree ounces of butter, the grated rind and the strained juice of a lemon, 
and lastly, stir in by degrees the well-beaten yolks of five eggs, and a 
dessertspoonful of flour, or in lieu of the last, three or feur Naples^ 
biscuits, or macaroons crushed small. Bake the pudding for a full half 
hour in a moderate oven, or longer should it not be quite firm in the 
middle. A little clarifieid butter poured on the top, with sugar sifted 
over, improves all baked puddings. 

Apples, 1 lb. ; sugar, 6 ozs. ; water, 1 cupful ; butter, 3 ozs. ; juice 
and rind, 1 lemon ; 5 eggs : ) hour, or more. 

069.-;-Many cooks press the apples through a sieve after they are 
boiled, but this is not needful when they are ofa good kind, and stewed, 
and beaten smooth. 

A COMMON BAKED APPIiE PUDDING. 

Boil a pound and a quarter of apples with half a small cupful of 
water and six ounces of brown sugary when they are reduced to a 
smooth pulp, stir to them two ounces of butter, a tablespoonfnl of flour* 
or a handful of fine bread-crumbs, and five well-beaten eggs ; grate iir 
half a nutmeg, or flavour the pudding with pounded cinnamon, and 
bake it nearly three quarters of an hour. More or less of sugar will be 
required for these puddings, according to the time of year, as the fruit 
is much more acid when first gathered than when it has been some 
months stored. 

Apples, 1^ lb.; water, i small cupful; sugar, 6 ozs. ; butter, 2 ozs. ; 
flour, 1 tablespoonful, or bread-crumbs, 1 handful ; ^ nutmeg ; eggs, 5 : 
j hour. ^ 

ESSEX PUDDING. (CHEAP AND GOOD.) 

Mix with a quarter of a pound of mashed potatoes, half a pound of 
good boiling apples minced, four ounces of brown sugar, four small eggs 
well beaten and strained, and a little grated lemon-peel or nutmeg. 
Increase the ingredients one half, and add two ounces of butter, should 
a larger and better pudding be desired: about half an hour will 
bake it 

Potatoes mashed, 4 oza ; apples, 8 ozs. ; sugar, 4 ozs. ; eggs, 4 : i 
hour. 

DUTCH CUSTARD, OR BAKED RASPBERRY PUDDING. 

Lay into a tartxiish a border of puff^paste, and a pint and a half of 
fresnly-gathered raspberries, well mixed with three ounces of sugar. 
Whisk Sioroughly six large eggs with three ounces more of sugar, and 



5)92 MODERN COOKERY# []CHAP. XVUI. 

pour it over the fhiit: b&ke the pudding from t^^enty-fiVe to thirty 
minutes in a moderate oven. 

Break the eggs one at a time into a cup, and with the point of a 
small three-pronged fork take off the specks or germs, he&re they are 
beaten, as we have directed in page 269. 

Raspberries, IJ pint ; sugar, 6 ozs. ; eggs, 6 : 25 to 80 minutes. 

VERMICELLI PUDDING. 

Drop lightly into a pint and a half of boiling milk four ounces of 
fre^ vermicelli, and keep it simmering and stirred gently ^ ten mi- 
nutes, when it will have become very thick ; then mix with it three 
ounces and a half of sugfar, two ounces of butter, and a small pinch of 
salt When the whole is well blended, pour it out ; beat it for a couple 
of minutes to cool it a little; then add by degrees five weli-whisked 
eggs, the grated rind of a lemon, and just before it is put into the dish, 
a small glass of brandy : bake it from half to three quarters of an hour. 
Vermicelli varies much in quality, and of some kinds three ounces will 
render the pudding quite firm enough. 

Milk, li pint ; vermicelli, 4 ozs. ; 10 minutes. Sugar, Si ozs, ; but* 
ter, 2 ozs. ; pinch of salt ; eggs, 5 ; lemond-rind, 1 ; brandy, 1 wine- 
glassful : itoi hour. 

Obs. — This pudding requires, more than many others, a little clari- 
fied butter poured on the top, aud sugar sifted over. Candied peel may 
be added to it with good effect; and three or four bitter almonds, 
pounded, may be used to give it flavour instead of lemon-rind. 

SMALL COOOA-NUT PIJDDIN08. 

Melt together over a slow fire two ounces of fi*esh butter cut small, 
and four of pounded sugar; pour them out when they have boiled for a 
couple of minutes, and let them cool; mix with them two ounces of 
finely-grated cocoa-nut, an ounce of citron shred small, the grated rind 
of half a large lemon, and four eggs: when these have been well beaten 
together, add the strained juice of the half lemon ; put the mixture into 
buttered pattypans, or pudding-cups, sift sugar over, and bake them half 
an hour in a moderate oven. This is an excellent and a perfectly new 
receipt ; but in making use of it care should be taken to ascertain that 
the nut be fresh and sweet flavoured, as the slightest degree of rancidity 
will spoil the puddings. They are better hot than cold, though very 
good either way. 

Fresh butter, 2 ozs. ; pounded sugar, i lb. ; cocoa-nut, 2 ozs. ; candied 
citron, 1 oz. ; rind and juice of ^ lemon ; eggs, 4: ^ hour. 

Oba, — The same ingredients may be made into one pudding only, and 
longer baked. 

GOOD YORKSHIRE PUDDING. . 

To make a very good and light Yorkshire pudding, take an equd. 
number of eggs and of heaped tablespoonsful of flour, with a teaspoonful 
of salt to six of these. Whisk the eggs v>e.ll, strain, and mix them 
gradually with the flour, then pour in by degrees as much new milk as 
will reduce the batter to the consistency of rather thin cream. The 
tin which is to receive the pudding must have been placed for some 
time previously under a joint that has been put down to roast: one ot 
beef is usually preferred. Beat the batter briskly efdd lightly, the in*

stant before it is poured into the pan, watch it carefully tnai it may not 
burn, and ]€^ the edges have an equal share of the fire. When the 
pudding is quite firm in every part, and well-coloured on the surface, 
turn it to brown the under side. This is best accomplished by first 
dividing it into quarters. In Yorkshire it is made much thinner than 
in the south, rgasted generally at an enormous fire, and Tiot turned at 
all : currants there are sometunes added to it 

^ggs, 6 ; flour, six heaped tablespoonsful, or from 7 to 8 ozs. ; milk, 
nearly or quite, 1 pint ; salt, 1 teaspoonful : 2 hours. 

065. — This puddinff should be quite an inch thick when it is browned 
on both sides, but only half the depth when roasted in the Yorkshire 
mode. The cook must exercise her discretion a little in mixing the 
batter, as ^om the variation of weight in flour, and in the size of eggs, . 
a little more or less of milk may be required : the whole should be rather 
more liquid than for a boiled pudding. 

COMMON TO&KSHIUE PUDDINO. 

Half a pound of flour, three eggs (we would recommend a fourth), 
rather more than a pint of milk, and a teaspoonful of salt 

NORMANDY PUDDINO. (OOOD.) 

Boil, until very soft and dry, ei^ht ounces of rice in a pint and a half; 
or rather more, of water,* stir to it two ounces of fresh butter, and'threo 
of su^r, and simmer it for a few minutes after they are added ; then 
pour it out, and let it cool for use. Strip from the stalks as many red 
currants, or morella cherries, as will fill a tartrdish of moderate size, 
and for each pint of the fruit allow from three to four ounces of sugar. 
Line the bottom and sides of a deep dish with part of the rice ; next, 
put in a thick layer of fruit and sugar; then one of rice and one of fruit 
alternately until the dish is full. Sufficient of the rice should be re- 
served to form a rather thick layer at the top : smooth this equally with 
a knife, and send the pudding to a moderate but not very slow oven, for 
half an hour, and more, should it be large. When two thirds baked, it 
may be glazed with yolk of egg, brushed over, and fine sugar sifted on 
it Morella cherries, with a litUe additional sugar, make an excellent 
pudding of this kind. 

DAMSON-AND-RICE PUDDING. 

With five ounces of whole rice boiled soft and dry, mix an ounce of 
batter, ten ounces of damson-jam, a teaspoonful of lemon-juice, and five 
eggs. B€MBit the whole well together, and bake it about half an hour. 

Rice, 5 ozs. ; damson-jam, 10 ozs. ; butter, 1 oz. ; eggs, 5: } hour. 

BARBERRT-AND-RICE PUDDINO. 

Mix ten ounces of barberries stripped from the stalks, with four ounces 
of whole boiled rice, eight ounces of sugar, a small slice of butter, and 
five large, or six small eggs. 

APPLE-AND-RICE PUDDING. 

Boil together one pound of good pudding-apples, and six ounces of 
sugar, until they are reduced to a smooth pulp; stir them often to pre- 
vent their burning ; mix with them four ounces of boiled rice, two ounces

994 MODERN v*OOK£RT [CHAP. XVUL 

of butter, and five larg^ eggs. Should the applies be very acid, increase 
the quantity of sugar: add lemon rind or juice, at pleasure. These 
puddings are better if mixed while the ingredients are still warm. 

Apples, 1 lb. ; sugar, 6 ozs. ; boiled rice, 4 ozs. ; butter, 2 oza. ; eggs, 
5: 30 to 35 minutes. 

COMMON RAISIN PUDDING. 

Beat well together three quarters of a pound of flour, the same qnan- 
titv of raisins, six ounces of beef-suet, finely chopped, a small pinch of 
salt, some grated nutmeg, and three eggs which have been thoroughly 
whisked, and mixed with about a quarter-pint of ihilk, or less than this, 
should the eggs be large. Pour the whole into a buttered dish, and 
bake it an hour and a quarter. For a large pudding, increase the quan- 
tities one half. 

Flour and stoned raisins, each } lb. ; suet, 6 ozs. ; salt, small piuch ; 
nutmeg, i teaSpoonful; eggs, 3; milk, } pint: 1^ hour. 

A RICHER RAISIN PUDDING. 

Mix and whisk well, and lightly together, a pound of raisins weighed 
after they are stoned, ten ounces of finely minced beef-suet, three quar- 
ters of a pound of flour, a little salt, half^^a small nutmeg, or the grated 
rind of a lemon, four large eggs, and as much milk as may be needed 
to make the whole into a very thick batter : bake the pudding a few 
minutes longer than the preceding one. The addition of sugar will be 
found no improvement, as it will render it much leas light 

POOR author's pudding. 

Flavour a quart of new milk by boilinor in it for a few minutes half a 
stick of well-bruised cinnamon, or the thm rind of a small lemon; add a 
few grains of salt, and three ounces of su^r, and turn the whole into a 
deep basin ; when it is quite cold, stir to it three well-beaten eggs, and 
strain the mixture into a pie-dish. Cover the top entirely with slices 
of bread free from crust, and half an inch thick, cut so as to join neatly, 
and buttered on both sides: bake the pudding in a moderate oven for' 
about half an hour, or in a Dutch oven before the fire.

pudding a la patsanne ; (cheap and good,) 
Fill a deep tart-dish with alternate layers of well-sugared fruit, and 
very thin slices of the crumb of a li^ht stale loaf; let the upper layer be 
of fruit, and should it be of a dry kmd, sprinlde over it about a dessert- 
spoonful of water, or a little lemon-juice : raspberries, currants, and cher- 
ries, will not require this. Send the pudding to a somewhat brisk oven 
to be baked for about half an hour. The proportion of sugar used must 
be regulated, of course, by the acidity of the fruit For a quart of ripe 
greengages, split and stoned, five ounces will be sufficient Apricote, 
peaches, and nectarines will scarcely require more ; but damsons, bu' 
laces, and various other plums will need a much larger quantity. A 
'UPerior pudding of this kind is made by substituting sponge cake for 

INDIAN pudding. 

Put into a deep dish from six to eight ounces of rice which has been 



CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, OMLETs) &C. 295 

washed, and wiped in a dry cloth ; just moisten it with milk, and set it 
into a gentle oven ; add milk to it at intervals, in small quantities, unti« 
the grain is swollen to its full size, and is tender, but very dry;. then 
mix with it two dessertspoonsful of fine sugar, and if it should be at 
hand, four or five tablespoonsful of rich cream. Fill a tart-nlish almost 
to the brim with fruit properly sugared, heap the rice equally over it, 
leaving it rough, and bake it in a moderate oven for half an hour, unless 
the fruit should be of a kind to require a longer time; when very hard, 
it must be half stewed with the sugar before it is put into the dish. The 
rice may be swelled over a very ^ow fire when more convenient ; and 
the Dutch or American oven will serve quite well to bake the pudding. 

BAKED HASTY PUDDING. 

Take from a pint of new milk sufficient to mix into a thin better two 
ounces of flour, put the remainder, with a small pinch of salt, into a 
clean saucepan, and when it boils quickly, stir the flour briskly to it ; 
keep it stirred over a gentle fire for ten minutes, pour it out, and when 
it has become a little cool, mix with it two ounces of fresh, butter, three 
of pounded sugar, the grated rind of a small lemon, four large, or five 
small eggs, and half a glass of brandy, or as much orange-flower water. 
To these half a dozen bitter almonds, pounded to a paste, are sometimes 
added. Bake the pudding half an hour in a gentle oven. 

New milk, 1 jAnt ; flour, 2 ozs. : 10 minutes. Butter, 2 ozs. ; sugar, 
8 ozs. ; eg^, 4 or 5 ; grated rind of lemon ; brandy, or orange-flower 
water, i wjneglassful. 



CHAPTER XlXr 
SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &c. 

OBSERVATIONS ON OMLETS, FRITTERS, &C. 

The composition and nature of a souffle are altogether dififerent, but 
there is no difficulty in making good omlets, pancakes, or fritters, and 
as they may be expeditiously prepared and served, they are oflen a very 
convenient resource when, on short notice, an addition is required to a 
dinner. The eggs for all of them should be well and lightly whisked ; 
the lard for frying batter should be extremely pure in flavour, and quite 
hot when the fritters are dropped in ; the batter itself should be smooth 
as cream, and it should be briskly beaten the instant before it is used. 
All fried pastes should be perfectly drained from the fat before they are 
served, and sent to table promptly when they are ready. Eggs may be 
dressed in a multiplicity of ways, but are seldom, in any form, more 
relished than in a well-made and expeditiously served omlet. This may 
be plain, or seasoned with minced herbs, and a very little eschalot, when 
the last is liked, and is then called an " Omlette aux fines herbes ;" or 
it may be mixed with minced ham, or grated cheese; in any case, it 
should be light, thick, full-tasted, and fried only on one side; if turnetl 
in the pan, as it frequently is, it will at once be flattened and rendered 
tough. Should the slight rawness which is sometimes found in the

middle of the inside, when the omlet is made in the French way, be 
objected to. a heated shovel, or a salamander, may be held over it for 
an instant, before it is folded on the dish. The pan for frying it should 
be quite small ; for if it be composed of four or five eggs only, and then 
put into a large one, it will necessarily spread over it and be thin, which 
would render it more like a pancake than an omlet; the only partial 
remedy for this, when a pan of proper size cannot be had, is to raise the 
handle of it high, and to keep the opposite side clone down to the fire, 
which will confine the eg^ into a smaller space. No gravy should 
^ ever be poured into the dish with it, and indeed, if properly made, it 
will require none. Lard is preferable to butter for frying batter, as it. 
renders it lighter ; but it must not be used for omlets. 

A. OOMMON OMLET. 

Frpm four to eight very firesh eggs may be used for this, according to 
the sized dish required. Half a dozen will generally be sufficient. 
Break them singly and carefully ; clear them in the way we have 
already pointed out in the introduction to boiled puddings, or when they 
are sufficiently whisked pour tliem through a sieve, and resume the. 
beating until they are very light. Add to them fi'om half to a whole 
teaspoonfiil of salt, and a seasoning of pepper. Dissolve in a small fry- 
ing pan a couple of ounces of butter, pour in the eggs, and as soon aa 
the omlet is well risen and firm thfoughout, slide it* on to a hot dish, 
fold it together like a turnover, and serve it immediately ; from five ta 
seven minutes will fry it 

For other varieties of the omlet, see the observations which precede 
this. 

AN OMLETTE 80UF9<EE. 

Separate, as they are broken, the whites from the yolks of six fine 
fresh eggs ; beat these last^thoroughly, first by themselves and then with 
four tablespoonsful of dry, white sifted sugar, and the- rind of half a 
lemon grated on a fine grater.* Whisk the whites to a solid froth, and 
just before the omlet is poured into the pan, mix them well, but lightly, 
with the yolks. Put four ounces of fresh butlfer into a very small deli- 
cately clean omlet, or frying-pan, and as soon as it is all dissolved, add 
the eg& and stir them round, that thev may absorb it entirely. When 
the under side is just set, turn the omlet into a well-buttered dish, and 
send it to a tolerably brisk oven. From five to ten minutes will bake 
it; and it must be served the instant it is taken out; carried, indeed, as 
quickly as possible to table from the oven. It will have risen to a great 
height, but wiU sink and become heavy in a very short space of time : 
if sugar be sifted over it, let it be done with the utmost expedition. 

Sggs, 6; sugar, 4 tablespoonsful; rind, i lemon; butter, 4 ozs.: 
omlet baked, 5 to 10 minutes. 

Obs. — A large common frying-pan will not answer for omlets: a 
very small one should be kept for them, when there is no regular omlet- 
j>an. 

SOUFFLES. 

The admirable lightness and delicacy of a well-made souffle render it 
generally a very fiivourite dish, and it is now a &shionable one alsa It 

* As we have before said, a much more delicate flavour is imparted by ro^'ii^ the 
lemon-rind on sugar. 



CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFLES, 0MLBT8, &C. 297 

may be greatly varied in its composition, but in all cases roust be served 
the very instant it is taken from the oven ; and even in passing to the 
dining-room it should, if possible, be prevented from sinking by a heated 
iron or salamander held above it. A common souffle-pan may be pur- 
chased fi)r a dollar, in England, but those of silver, or plated metal are 
of course expensive ; the part in which the souffle is baked is placed 
within the more ornamental dish when it is drawn from the oven. A 
plain, round, shallow cake-mould, with a strip of writing-paper six 
jnches high, placed inside the rim, will answer on an emergency to bake 
a souffle in. The following receipt will serve as a guide ror the proper 
mode of making it : the process is always the same whether the prin- 
cipal ingredient be whole rice boiled very tender in milk and pressed 
through a sieve, bread-crumbs soaked as for a pudding and worked 
through a sieve also, arrow-root, potato-flour, or anything else of which 
light puddings in general are made. 

Take from a pint and a half of new milk or of cream sufficient to mix 
four ounces of flour of rice to a perfectly smooth batter; put the 
remainder into a very clean, well-tinned saucepan, and when it boils, 
stir the rice briskly to it ; let it simmer, keeping it stirred all the time, 
for ten minutes, or more should it not be very thick, then mix well with 
it two ounces of fresh butter, one and a half of pounded sugar, and the 
grated rind of a fine lemon (or let the sugar which is used mr it be well 
rubbed on the lemon before it is crushed to powder); in two or three 
minutes take it from tlie fire, and beat quickly and carefully to it by 
degrees the yolks of six eggs ; whisk the whites to a very firm solid 
froth, and when the pan is buttered, and all else quite ready for the 
oven, stir them gently to the other ingredients ; pour the souffle imme- 
diately into the pan and place it in a moderate oven, of which keep the 
door closed for a quarter of an hour at least When the souffle has 
risen very high, is of a fine colour, and quite done in the centre, which 
it will be in n'om half to three quarters of an hour, send it instantly to 
table. The exact time for baking it depends so much on the oven that 
it cannot be precisely specified. We have known quite a small one not 
too much baked in forty-five minutes in an iron oven ; but generally 
less time will suffice for them ; the heat, however, should always be 
moderate. 

New milk or cream, li pint; flour of rice, 4 ozs. ; fresh butter, 2 
ozs. ; pounded sugar, 1^ oz. ; eggs, 6; grain of salt; rind, 1 lemon: 
30 to 45 minutes. 

Obs. 1. — The souffle may be flavoured with vanilla, orange-flowers, 
or aught else that Is liked. Chocolate and coffee also may be used for 
it wi^ soaked bread : a very strong infusion of the last, and an ounce 
or two of the other, melted with a little water, are to be added to the 
milk and bread. 

Obs, 2. — A souffle is commonly served in a dinner of ceremony as a 
remove of the roast, but the better plan for this, as for a fondu, is to 
have it quickly handed round, instead of being placed upon, the table. 

A PONDU. 

Mix to a smooth batter, with a quarter of a pint of new milk, two 
ounces of potato- flour, arrow-root, or tous les mois : pour boiling to tliem 
three quarters of a pint more of milk, or of cream in preference, stir 



£86 MOVttKS COOKSRT. [cRAP. XIX. 

them well together, and then thVow in two ounces of batter cut small. 
When this is melted, and well-beaten into the mixture, add the well 
whisked yolks of four large or of five small eggs, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, something less of cayenne, and three ounces of lightly-grated 
cheese, Parmesan or rich old cheese, or equal parts of both. Whisk 
the whites of the eggs to a quite firm and solid noth; then proceed, as 
&r a souffle, to mix and bak» the fondu. 
20 minutes. 

KEimSH FRITTKRS. 

Beat up the whites of three eggs and the yolks of six with half a 
pound of flour, a cupful of milk, and a large teaspoonful of yeast: put 
the mixture into a jug, cover it, and set it by the fire until the next 
day, then add to the luitter two large apples finely chopped, and fry the 
fritters as usual. 

Whites of eggs, 3; yolks, 6; flour, 8 ozs.; milk, 1 copflil; yeast, 1 
teaspoonful : & hours. 

PLAIN COMMON FRITTERS. 

Mix with three well-beaten eggs a quarter-pint of milk, and strain 
them through a fine sieve : add them gradually to three large table- 
spoonsful of flour, and thin the batter with as much more milk as will 
bring it to the consistency of cream ; beat it up thoroughly at the mo- 
ment of using it, that the fritters may be light Drop it in small por- 
tions from a spouted jug or basin into boiling lard ; when lightly coloured 
on one side, turn them, drain them well from the lard as they are lifted 
out, and serve them very quickly. They are eaten generally with fine 
sugar, and orange or lemon juice : the first of these may be sifted thickly 
over them after they are dished, the oranges or lemons cut in two, and 
sent to table with them. The lard used &r frying them should be fresh 
and pure-flavoured: it renders them more crisp and light than butter, 
and is, therefore, better suited to the purpose. 

Eggs, 3 ; flour, 3 tablespoonsful ; milk, i to j pint 

PANCAKES. 

These may be made with the same batter as fritters, if it be suffi- 
ciently thinned with an additional egg or two, or a little milk or cream, 
to spread quickly over the pan : to fry them well, this ought to bcLsmall. 
When the batter is ready, heat the pan over a clear fire and rub it with 
butter in every part, then pour in sufficient batter to spread over it 
entirely, and let the pancake be very thin : in this case it will require 
no turning, but otherwise it must be tossed over with a sudden jerk of 
the pan, in which the cook who is not somewhat expert will not always 
succeed ; therefore the safer plan is to make them so thin that they will 
not require this. Keep them hot before the fire until a sufficient num- 
ber are ready to send to table, then proceed with a second supply, as 
they should always be quickly served. Either roll them up and strew 
fine sugar over them, or spread them quickly with preserve, laying 
them one on the other. A richer kind of pancake may be made with a 
pint of cream, or of cream and new milk mixed, five eg^ or their 
yolks only, a couple of ounces of flour, a little pounded cmnamon or 
femon-rind rasped on sugar and scraped into them, with two ounces 
more of pounded sugar, and two ounces of clarified butter. 

From 4 to 5 minutes. 



miTTXRfl OF OAKB AND PTRDDHIO. 

Cut plain pound, or rice cake into small square slices half an inch 
thick ; trim away the crust, fry them slowly a light brown, in a small 
quantity of fresh butter, and spread over them when done a layer of 
apricotgam, or of any other preserve, and serve them immediately. 
These fritters are improved by being moistened with a little good cream 
before they are iried : they must then be slightly floured. Cold plum- 
pudding sliced down as thick as the cake, and divided into portions of 
equal size and good form, then dipped into batter, and gently fried, will 
also make an agreeable variety of fritter. 

MINCEMEAT FRITTERA. 

With half a pound of mincemeat mix two ounces of fine bread-cmmbs 
(or a tablespoonful of flour), two eggs well beaten, and the strained juice 
of half a small lemon. Mix these well, and drop the fritters with a 
dessertspoon into plenty of .very pure lard or fresh butter; fry them from 
seven to eight minutes, drain them on a napkin or on white blotting 
paper, and send them very hot to table : they should be quite small. 

Mincemeat, ^ lb. ; bread-crumbs, 2 ozs. (or flour, 1 tablespoonful) ; 
eggs, 2 ; juice of ^ lemon : 7 to 8 minutes. 

VENETIAN FRITTERS. {Very good.) 

Pick, wash, and drain three ounces of whole rice, put it into a full 
pint of cold milk, and bring it very slowly to boil; stir it often, and let 
it simmer gently until quite thick and dry. When about three parts 
done, add to it two ounces of pounded sugar, and one of fresh butter, a 
grain of salt, and the grated rind of half a small lemon. Let it cool in 
tiie saucepan, and when only just warm mix with it thoroughly three 
ounces of currants, four apples, chopped fine, a teaspoonful of flour, and 
Uiree large or four small well-beaten eggs. Drop the mixture in small 
fritters, Sy them in butter from five to seven minutes, and let them 
become quite firm on one side before they are turned : do this with a 
slice. Drain them as they are taken up, and sift white sugar over 
them after they are dished. 

Whole rice, 3 ozs.; milk, Ipint; sugar, 2 ozs.; butter, 1 oz.; grated 
rind of i lemon; currants, 3 ozs.; minced apples, 4 ozs.;. flour, 1 
leaspoonfiil ; a little salt; eggs, 3 large or 4 small ; 5 to 7 minutes. 

FRITTERS OF SPRING FRUIT* 

The rhubarb for these should be of a good sort, quickly grown, and 
tender. Pare, cut it into equal lengths, and throw it into the French 
batter of page 113 ; vi^ith a fork lift the stalks separately, and put them 
into a pan of boiling lard or butter : in from five to six minutes they 
will be done. Drain them well and dish them on a napkin, or pile them 
high without one, and strew sifted sugar plentifully over them : they 
should be of a very light brown, and quite dry and crisp. The young 
stalks look well when left in their entire length, and only slighUy en- 
crusted with the batter, through which they should be merely drawn. 

d to 6 minutes. 

APPLE, PEACH, APRICOT, OR ORANGE FRITTERS. 

Pare and core without dividing the apples, slice them in rounds the 
full size of the fruit, dip them into the same batter as that directed foi 



ROD MODSRN COOKXRT. [CHAP. XIX. 

the Receding fritters; fir them a pale brown, and let them be verr 
dry. Serve them heaped high upon a folded napkin, and strew sifted 
9ugar over them. After having stripped the outer rind from the oranges, 
remove carefully the white inner skin, and in slicing them take out 
the pipe ; then dip them into the batter and proceed as for the apple 
fritters. The peaches and apricots should be merely skinned, halved, 
and stoned before they are drawn through the batter, unless they should 
not be fully ripe, when they must first be stewed tender in a thin syrup. 
8 to 12 minutes. 

POTATO FRrrmts. (BirntBurs.) 

See directions for potato puddings. The same mixture dropped in 
fritters into boiling butter, and fried until firm on both sides, will be 
found very good. 

LEMON FRITTERa. (ENTREMETS.) 

Mix with six ounces of very fine breaxi-crumbs four of beef saet, 
minced as small as possible, four ounces of pounded sugar, a small table- 
spoonful of flour, four wiiole eggs, well and lightly whisked, and the 
grated rind of one large or of two small lemons, with half or the whole 
of the juice, at choice ; but befpre this last is stirred in, add a spoonful 
or two of milk or cream, if needed. Fry the mixture in small fritters 
for five or six minutes. 

CANNELONS. (ENTREMETS.) 

Roll out very thin and evenly some fine pufi^-paste into a long strip of 
from three to four inches wide, moisten the surface with a feather dipped 
in white of egg, and cut it into bands of nearly two inches wide; lay 
some apricot or peach marmalade equally along these, and fold the paste 
twice over it, close the ends carefully, and when all are ready slide 
them gently into a pan of boiling lard ; * as soon as they begin to brown, 
raise Uie pan firom the fire that they may not take too much colour be- 
fore the paste is done quite through. Five minutes will fry them. 
Drain them well, and dry them on a soft cloth before the fire ; dish 
them on a napkin, and place one layer crossing another, or merely pile 
them high in the centre. If well made, and served of a light brown 
and very dry, these cannelons are excellent : when lard is objected to 
butter may be used instead, but the paste will then be somewhat leal 
light Only lard of the purest quality will answer for the purpose. 
. 5 minutes. 

CROQUETTES OF RICE. (ENTREMETS.) 

Wipe very clean, in a dr}^ cloth, seven ounces of rice, put it into a 
clean stewpan, and pour on it a quart of new milk ; let it swell gently 
by the side of the fire, and stir it often that it may not stick to the pan, 
nor burn ; when it is about half done, stir to it five ounces of pounded 
suorar, and six bitter almonds beaten extremely fine : the thin rind of 
half a firesh lemon may be added in the first instance. The rice must 
be simmered until it is soft, and very thick and dry ; it should then be 
spread on a dish, and left until cold, when it is to be rolled into small 
balls, which must be dipped into beaten egg, and then covered in every 
part with the finest br^-crumbs. When all are ready, fry them a

light brown in ftesti butter, and dry them well before the fire, apon a 
sieve reversed and covered with a very soft cloth, or with a sheet of 
white blotting-paper. Pile them in a hot dish, and send them to table 
quickly. 

Rice, 7 ozs. ; milk, 1 quart; rind of lemon: 4 hour. Sugar, 5 oxd.; 
bitter almonds, 6 : 40 to 60 minutes, or more. Fried, 5 to 7 minutes. 

FINEU CROQUETTES OF BICE. (eNTEBMETS.) 

Swell the rice in thin cream, or in new milk strongly flavoured 
with cocoa-nut; then add the same ingredients as in Uie foregoing 
receipt, and when the rice is cold, form it into balls, and with the thumb 
of the right hand hollow them sufficiently to admit in the centre a 
«mall portion of peach jam, or of apricot marmalade ; close the rice 
well over it ; egg, crumb, and fry the croquettes as usual. As, from 
the difierence of quality, the same proportions of rice and milk will not 
always produce the same effect, the cook must use her discretion in 
adding, should it be needed, sufficient liquid to soften the rice perfectly : 
but she must bear in mind that if not boiled extremely thick and dry, it 
will be difficult to make it into croquettes. 

RISSOLES. (eMTRJEE.) 

This is the French name for small fried pa^ry of various forms, filled 
with meat or fish previously cooked ; they may be made with brioehef or 
with light pufi^-paste, either of which must be rolled extremely thin. 
Cut it with a small round cutter fluted or plain ; put a little rich mince, 
or good pounded meat, in the centre, and mdsten the edges, and press 
them securely together that they may not burst open in the firying. 
The rissoles may be formed like small patties, by laying a second roumi 
of paste over the meat; or like cannelons; they may, likewise, be 
brushed with egg, and sprinkled with vermicelli, broken small, or with 
fine crumbs. They are sometimes made in the form of croauettes, the 
paste being gathered round the meat, which must form a balL 

In frying them, adopt the same plan as for the croquettes, raising the 
pan as soon as the paste is lightly coloured. Serve all these firied dished 
well drained, and on a napkin. 

From 5 to 7 minutes, or less. 

VERT SAVOtJRT RISSOLES. (eNTRKE.) 

Make the forcemeat No. 1, page 122, sufficiently firm with unbeaten 
yolk of egg, to roll rather thin on a well-floured board ; cut it into very 
small rounds, put a little pounded chicken in the centre of one hal( 
moistening the edges with water, or white of egg, lay the remaining 
rounds over these,- close them securely, and fry them in butter a fine 
light brown ; drain and dry them well, and heap them in the middle of 
a hot dish, upon a napkin folded flat: these rissoles may be egged and 
crumb^ before they are fried. 

RISSOLBB OF TIBH. (eUTBEE.) 

Take perfectly clear from bones and skin, the/ flesh of any cold flsh 
that can be pounded to an exceedingly fine paste ; add to it, when in 
the mortar, from one quarter to a third as much of good butter, and a 
high seasoning of cayenne, with a moderate one of mace and nutmeg. 
To these may be added, at pleasure, a few eiirimps, or a little of any of

ti02 MODERN COOKEBT. [CHAP. XIX 

the finer fish sances, or some lobster-coral. When the whole is well 
beaten and blended tog^ether, roll out some good puff-paste extremely 
thin, and with a small round tin shape, cut out the number of rissoles 
required ; put some of the fish into each of these, moisten the edges 
with white of egg, fold and press them securely together, and when all 
are ready, slip them gently into a pan of boiling lard or butter ; fry them 
a pale brown, drain them well, and dry them on white blotting-paper, 
laid upon a sieve, reversed ; but do not place them sufficiently near to 
SBCorch or to colour them. 

TO BOIL PIPE MAGCARONI. 

We have found always the continental mode of dressing maccaroni the 
best English cooks sometimes soak it in milk and water for an hour 
or more, l^fore it is boiled, that the pipes may be swollen to the utmost, 
^t this is apt to render it pulpy, though its appearance may be im- 
proved by it. Drop it lightly, and by degrees, into a large pan of fast- 
Doiling water, into which a little salt, and a bit of butter the size of a 
walnut, have previously been thrown, and of which the boiling should 
not be stopped by the addition of the maccaroni In from three quar- 
ters of an hour to an hour this will be sufficiently tender ; it should 
always be perfectly so, as it is otherwise indigestible, though the pipes 
iidioufd remain entire. Pour it into a large cullender, and drain the 
water well from it. It should be very softly boiled after the first minute 
or twa 

j to 1 hour. 

RIBBAIO) MACCARONI. 

This is dressed in precisely the same manner as the pipe maccaroni, 
but requires only from fourteen to sixteen minutes* boiling in water» 
and twenty or more in broth or stock. 

DRESSED MACCARONI. 

Pour ounces of pipe maccaroni is sufficient for a small dish, but from 
six to eight should be prepared for a family party where it is liked. 
The common English mode of dressing it is with grated cheese, butter, 
and cream, or milk. French cooks substitute generally a spoonful or 
two of very strong rich jellied gravy for the cream; and the Italians, 
amongst their many other modes of serving it, toss it in rich brown 
gravy, with sufficient grated cheese to flavour the whole strongly ; they 
send it to table also simply laid into a good Espagnole or brown gravy 
(that drawn from the stufato, for example), accompanied by a plate of 

f rated cheese. Another, and an easy mode of dressing it is to boil and 
rain it well, and to put it into a deep dish, strewing grated cheese on 
every layer, and adding bits of fresh butter to it The top, in this case, 
should be covered with a layer of fine bread-crumbs, mixed with grated 
cheese; these should be moistened plentifully with clarified butter, and 
colour given to them in the oven, or before the fire; the crumbs maybe 
omitted, and a layer of cheese substituted for them. An excellent pre- 
paration of maccaroni may be made with any well-flavoured, dry white 
cheese, which can be grated easily, at much less cost than with the F^r- 
mesan, which is expensive, and in the country not always procurable 
even ; we think that the rich brown gravy is also a great advantage to 
die disii, which is further improved by a tolerably high seasoning of 



CHAP. XIXJ] SOUFFLES, OMLETS, &C. . SOB 

cayeDDe. These, however, are innovations on the usual modes of serv* 
iug it in England. 

Ailer it has been boiled quite tender, drain it well, disisolve from two 
to three ounces uf good butter in a clean stewpan, with a few spoonsftil 
of rich cream, or of white sauce, lay in part of the maccaroni, strew 
part of the cheese upon it, add the remainder of the maccaroni and the 
cheese, and toss the whole gently until the ingredients are well incor- 
porated, and adhere to the maccaroni, leaving no liquid perceptible : 
serve it immediately. 

Maccaroni, 6 ozs. ; butter, 3 ozs. ; Parmesan cheese, 6 ozs. ; cream, 
4 tablespoonsful. 

Obs. — If preferred so, cheese may be strewed thickly over the mac- 
caroni after it is dished, and just melted and browned with a salamander. 

MACCARONI A LA REINE. 

This is a very excellent and delicate mode of dressing maccaronu 
Boil eight ounces, in the usual way (see page 302), and by the time it is 
sufficiently tender, dissolve gently ten ounces of any rich, well-flavoured 
white cheese in full three quarters of a pint of good cream ; add a little 
salt, a rather full seasoning of cayenne, from half to a whole saltspoon- 
ful of pounded mace, and a couple of ounces of sweet fresh butter. 
The cheese should, in the first instance, be sliced very thin, and taken 
quite free of the hard part adjoining the rind; it should be stirred in the 
cream without intermission until it is entirely dissdtVed, and the whole 
is perfectly smooth : the maccaroni, previously well-drained, may then 
be tossed gently in it, or after it is dished, the cheese may be poured 
equally over the maccaroni. The whole, m either case, may be thickly 
covered before it is sent to table, with fine crumbs of bread fried of a 
pale gold colour, and dried perfectly, either before the fire or in an oven, 
when such an addition is considered an improvement. As a matter of 
precaution, it is better to boil the cream before the cheese is melted 
in it ; rich white sauce, or bechamel, made not very thick, with an 
additional ounce or two of butter, may be used to vary and enrich this 
preparation. If Parmesan cheese* be used for it, it must of course be 
grated. Half the quantity may be served. 

Maccaroni, i lb. ; cheese, 10 ozs. ; good cream, ^ pint (or rich white 
sauce) ; butter, 2 ozs. (or more) ; little salt, Jine cayenne, and mace. 

FORCED EGOS FOR SALAD. 

Boil six fresh effgs for twelve minutes, and when they are perfectly 
cold, halve them lengthwise, take out the yolks, pound them to a paste 
with a third of their volume of fresh butter; then add a quarter tea- 
spoonful of mace, and as much cayenne as will season the mixture well ; 
beat these together thoroughly, and fill the whites of egg neatly with 
them. A morsel of garlic, not larger than a pea, perfectly blended with the 
other ingredients, would to some tastes greatly improve this preparation. 

Eggs, 6; butter, size of 2 yolks; mace, i teaspoonful; cayenne, third 
as much. 

FORCED EGOS, OR EGGS EN SURPRISE. (ENTREMETS.) 

Boil, and divide, as in the receipt above, half a dozen very fresh eggs;

the insides well, fill them smoothly witli the yolks, form a small dome 
in the centre of the dish with the remainder of the mixture, and lean 
the eggs against it, placing them regularly round. Set them into a 
gentle oven for ten minutes,* and ^nd them quickly to table.

SWEET DISHES, OR ENTREMETS. 

TO PKEPASB CAUr's FEET 8T0CK.t 

The feet are usually sent in from the butcher's ready to dress, bat as 
a matter of economy I or of convenience it is sometimes desirable to 
have them altogether prepared by the cook. Dip them into cold water, 
lay them into a deep pan, and sprinkle equally over them on both sides 
some rosin in fine po\yder ; pour in as much boiling water as will cover 
them well, and let them remain for a minute or two untouched ; then 
scrape the hair clean from them with the edge of a knife. When this 
is done, wash them very thoroughly both in hot and in cold water; di- 
vide them at the joint, split the claws, and take away the fat that is 
between them. Should the feet be large, put a gallon of cold water to 
the four, but from a pint to a quart less if they be of moderate size or 
small. Boil them gently down until the flesh has parted entirely from 
the bones, and the liquor is reduced nearly or quite half; strain, and let 
it stand until cold ; remove every particle of fiit from the top before it 
is used, and be careful not to take the sediment. 

Calf's feet, (large) 4 ; water, 1 gallon : 6 to 7 hours. 

TO CLARIFY CALP's FEET STOCK. 

Break up a quart of the stock, put it into a clean stewpen with the 
whites of five large or of six small eggs, two ounces of sugar, and the

flavouring*, and weight of sugar ; or pour the boiling stock very gradu- 
ally to some finely pounded almonds, and express it from them as 
directed for Quince Blamange, allowing from six to eight ounces to the 
pint. 

Stock, 1 quart ; whites of eggs, 5 ; sugar, 2 ozs. ; juice, 1 small lemon : 
5 to 8 minutes. 

TO CLARIFY ISINGLASS. 

The finely-cut purified isinglasis, which is now in general use, re- 
quires no clarifying except for clear jellies : for all other dishes it is 
sufficient to dissolve, skim, and pass it through a muslin strainer. 
When two ounces are required for a dish, put two and a half into a 
delicately clean pan, and pour on it a pint of spring water which has 
been gradually mixed with a teaspoonful of beaten white of egg; stir 
these thoroughly together, and let them heat slowly by the side of a 
gentle fire, but do not allow the isinglass to stick to the pan. When 
the scum is well risen, which it will be afler two or three minutes' sim- 
mering, clear it off, and continue the skimming until no more appears, 
then, should the quantity of liquid be more than is needed, reduce it by 
quick boiling to the proper point, strain it through a thin muslin, and 
set it by for use : it will be perfectly transparent, and may be mixed 
lukewarm with the clear and ready sweetened juice of various fruits, or 
used wMth the necessary proportion of syrupy for jellies flavoured with 
choice liquors. As the clarifying reduces the strength of the isinglass, — 
or rather as a portion of it is thken up by the white egg, — an additional 
quarter to each ounce must be allowed for this : if the scum be laid to 
drain on the back of a fine sieve which has been wetted with hot water, 
a little very strong jelly will drip from it. 

Isinglass, 2^ ozs.; water, 1 pint; beaten white of egg, 1 teaspoonful. 

SPINACH GREEN, FOR COLOURING SWEET DISHES, CONFECTIONAKT, 

OR SOUPS. 

Pound quite to a pulp, in a marble or wedgewood mortar, a handful 
or two of young freshly-gathered spinach, then throw it into a hair- 
sieve, and press through all the juice that can be obtained from it ; pour 
this into a clean white jar, and place it in a pan of water that is at the 
point of boiling, and which must be allowed to just simmer afterwards; 
m three or four minutes the juice will be poached or set ; take it then 

ently with a spoon, and lay it upon the back of a fine sieve to drain. 

f wanted for immediate use, merely mix it in the mortar with some 
finely^powdered sugar ;* but if to be kept as a store, pound it with as 
much as will render the whole tolerably dry, boil it to candy-height 
over a very clear fire, pour it out in cakes, and keep them in a tin 
box or canister. For this last preparation consult the receipt for orange- 
flower candy. 

PREPARED APPLE, OR QUINCE JUICE. 

Pour into a clean earthen pan two quarts of spring water, and throw 
into it as quickly as they can be pared, cored, and weighed, four pounds 
of nonsuches, pippins, or any other good boiling apples of fine flavour 
When all are done stew them gently until ihey are well broken, but

not reduced quite to pulp; turn theni into a jelly-bag or strain the jaice 
from them without pressure through a closely-woven cloth, which should 
be gathered over the fruit, and tied, and suspended above a deep 'pan 
until the juice ceases to drop from it: this, if not very clear, must be 
rendered so before it is used for syrup or jelly, but for all other purposes 
once straining it will be sufficient Quinces are prepared in the same 
way, and with the same pro(K)rtions of fruit and watei, but they must 
not be too long boiled, or the juice will become red. We have found it 
answer well to have them simmered until they are perfectly tender, 
and then to leave them with their liquor in a bowl until the following, 
day, when the juice will be rich and clear. They should be thrown 
into the water very quickly after they are pared and weighed, as the 
air will soon discolour them. 

Water, 2 quarts ; apples, or quinces, 4 lbs. 

ooooA-NUT FLAVOURED MILK. {FoT sweet dishcs, ^c.) 

Pare the dark outer rind from a very fresh nut, and grate it on a fine 
and exceedinffly clean grater ; to every three ounces pour a quart of 
new milk, and simmer them very softly for three quarters of an hour, or 
more, that a full flavour of the nut may be imparted to the milk with- 
out its being much reduced; strain it through a fine sieve, or cloth, 
with sufficient pressure to leave the nut almost dry : it may then be used 
lor bla mange, custards, rice, and other puddings, light cakes and bread. 

To each quart new milk, 3 ozs. grated cocoa-nut : ^ to 1 hour. 

06». — ^The milk of the nut, when perfectly sweet and good, may be 
!idded to the other with advantage. To obtain it, bore one end of the 
shell with a gimlet, and catch the liquid in a cup; and to extricate the 
kernel, break the shell with a hammer : this is better than sawing if 
asunder. 

COMPOTES OF FRUIT. 

We would particularly invite the attention of the reader to these 
wholesome and agreeable preparations of fruit, which are much less 
served at English tables, generally, than they deserve tQ be. We have 
found them oflen peculiarly acceptable to persons of delicate habit who 
were forbidden to partake of pastry in any form; and accompanied by a 
dish of boiled rice, they af e very preferable for children, as well as for 
invalids, to either tarts or puddingfs. 

Compote of spring fruit. — (Rhubarb^ Take a pound of the stalks 
after they are pared, and cut them into short lengths , have ready a 
quarter-pint of water boiled gently for ten minutes with five ounces of 
sugar, or with six should the fruit be very acid ; put it in, and simmer 
it for about ten minutes. Some kinds will be tender in rather less 
time, some will require more. 

Obs. — Good sugar in lumps should be used generally for these dishes, 
and when they are intended for dessert the syrup should be enriched 
with an additional ounce or twa Lisbon sugar will answer for them 
very well on ordinary occasions, but that which is refined will render 
them much more delicate. 

Compote of green currants, — Spring water half pint ; sugar five 
ounces; boiled together ten minutes. One pint of green currants 8tri{^ 
ped from the stalks; simmered three to &ye minutes. 

Cbmfw/e of green gooseberrie»,^~Thui is an excellent compote if made

with fine sugar, and very good with any kind. Break five ounces into 
small lumps and pour on them half a pint of water ; boil these gently for 
ten minutes, and clear off all the scum ; then add to them a pint of fresh 

fooseberries freed from the tops and stalks, washed, and well drained, 
iimnier them gently from eight to ten minutes, and serve them hot or 
cold. Increase the quantity for a large dish. 

Comjhle of green apricots, — Wipe the down from a pound of quite 
young apricots, and stew them very gently for nearly twenty minutes in 
syrup made with eight ounces of sugar and three quarters of a pint of 
water, boiled together the usual time. 

Compote of red currants, — ^A quarter-pint of water and five ounces 
of sugar : ten minutes. One pint of ready picked currants to be just 
simmered in the syrup from five to six minutes. This receipt will serve 
equally for raspberries^ or for a compote of the two fruits mixed toge- 
ther. Either of them will be found an admirable accompaniment to 
batter, custard, bread, ground rice, and various other kinds of puddings^ 
as well as to whole rice plainly boiled. 

Compote of cherries, — Simmer five ounces of sugar with half a pint 
of water for ten minutes; throw into the syrup a pound of cherries 
weighed after they are stalked, and let them stew gently for twenty 
minutes; it is a great improvement to stone the fruit, but a larger 
quantity will then be required for a dish. 

Compote of Morella Cherries. — Boil together for fifteen minutes, five 
ounces of sugar with half a pint of water ; add a pound and a quarter 
of ripe Morella cherries, and simmer thevavery softly from five to seven 
minutes ; this is a delicious compote. 

Compote of Damsons. — Four ounces of sugar and half a pint of 
water to be boiled for ten minutes ; one pound of damsons to be added, 
and simmered gently from ten to twelve minutes. 

Compote of the Magnum Bonum, or other large plums. — Boil six 
jOimces of sugar with half a pint of water the usual time ; take the 
stalks from a pound of plums, and simmer them very softly for twenty 
minutes. Increase the proportion of sugar if needed, and regulate tlie 
time as may be necessary for the difforent varieties of fruit. 

Compote of huUaces, — The large, or shepherds' bullace, is very good 
stewed, but will require a considerable quantity of sugar to render it 
palatable, unless it be quite ripe. Make a syrup with eight ounces, and 
three^uarters of a pint of water, and boil in it gently from fifteen to 
twenty minutes, a pint and a half of the bullaces freed from their stalks. 

COMPOTE OF PEACHES. 

Pare half a dozen ripe peaches, and stew them very softly from eigh- 
teen to twenty minutes, keeping them often tumed.in a light syrup, 
made with five ounces of sugar, and half a pint of water boil^ together 
for ten minutea Dish the fruit ; reduce the syrup by quick boiling, 
pour it over the peaches, and serve them hot for a second-course dish, or 
cold for dessert. They should be quite ripe, and will be found delicious 
dressed thus. A little lemon-juice may be added to the syrup, and the 
blanched kemeb of two or three peach or apricot stonea 

Sugar, 5 ozs. ; water, i pint: 10 minutes. Peaches, 6: 18 to 20 
minutes.

way, bat will require to be stewed scmewhat longer, unless they be 
perfectly ripe. 

ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR STEWED PEACHES. 

Should the fruit be not perfectly ripe, throw it into boiling water and 
keep it just simmering, until the skin can be easily stripped off. Have 
ready half a pound of fine sugar boiled to a light syrup with three 
quarters of a pint of water; throw in the peaches, let them stew softly 
until quite tender, and turn them often that they may be equally done ; 
after they are dished, add a little strained lemon-juice to the syrup, and 
reduce it by a few minutes* very quick boiling. The fruit is sometimes 
pared, divided, and stoned, then gently stewed until it is tender. 

Sugar, 8 ozs. ; water, | pint : 10 to 12 minutes. Peaches, 6 or 7 ; 
lemon-juice, 1 large teaspoonful. 

STEWED BARBERRIES, OR COMPOTE D^EPHIE-YINETTE. 

• 

Boil to a thin syrup half a pound of sugar and three quarters of a pint 
of water, skim it well, and throw into it three quarters of a pound of 
barberries stripped from the stalks ; keep tliem pressed down into the 
syrup, and gently stirred : from five to seven minutes will boil them. 

Sugar, 8 ozs. ; water, | pint : 12 to 15 minutes. Barberries, j lb. : 
5 to 7 minutes. 

ANOTHER COMPOTE OF BARBERRIES FOR DESSERT. 

When this fruit is first ripe it requires, from its excessive^ acidity, 
nearly its weight of sugar le render it palatable; but after hanging 
some time upon the trees it becomes much mellpwed in flavour, and 
may be sufficiently sweetened with a smaller proportbn. According 
to the state of the fruit then, take for each pound (leaving it in bunches) 
from twelve to sixteen ounces of sugar, and boil it with three quarters 
of a pint of water until it forms a syrup. Throw in the bunches of 
fruit, and simmer them for five or six minutes. If their weight of sugar 
be used, they will become in that time perfectly transparent. As all 
vessels of tin afiect the colour of the barberries, tiiey should be boiled in 
a copper stewpan, or in a German enamelled one, which would be far 
better. 

Barberries, 1 lb. ; sugar, 12 to 16 ozs. ; water, j pint: firuit simmered 
in syrup, 5 to 6 minutes. 

OATEAU DE POMMES. 

Boil together for fifleen minutes a pound of well-refined sugar and 
half a pint of water ; then add a couple of pounds of nonsuches, or of 
any other finely-flavoured apples which can be boiled easily to a smooth 
pulp, and the juice of a couple of small, or of one very large lemon. 
Stew these gently until the mixture is perfectly free from lumps, then 
boil it quickfy, keeping it stirred, without quitting it, until it forms a 
very thick and dry marmalade. A few minutes before it is done add 
the finely grated rinds of a couple of lemons; when it leaves the bottom 
of the preserving-pan visible and dry, press it into moulds of tasteful 
form ; and either store it for winter use, or if wanted for table, serve it 
plain for dessert, or ornament it with spikes of blanched almonds, and 
pour a custard round it for a second-course dish. 

Sugar, 1 lb. ; water, i pint : 15 minutes. Nonsuches or other applesy 
2 tbs. ; jnice, 1 large or 2 small lemons : 2 hours or more.

6ATE4U OF MIXED FRUITS. (OOOD.) 

Extract the juice from some fresh red currants by simmeringr them 
very gently for a few minutes over a slow fir6; strain it through a 
folded muslin, and to one pound of it add a pound and a half of non- 
suches or of freshly gathered apples, pared, and rather deeply cored, 
that the fibrous part of the apple may be avoided. Boil these quite 
slowly until the mixture is perfectly smooth, then, to evaporate part of 
tlie moisture, let the boiling be quickened. In from twenty-five to 
thirty minutes draw the pan from the fire, and throw in gradually a 
pound and a quarter of sugar in fine powder; mix it well wiSi the fruit, 
and when it is dissolved continue the boiling rapidly for twenty minutes 
longer, keeping the mixture constantly stirred ; put it into a mould, and 
store it, when cold, for winter use, or serve it for dessert, or for the 
second course : in the latter case decorate it with spikes of almonds 
blanched, and heap solid whipped cream round it, or pour a custard 
into the dish. For dessert, it may be garnished witli dice of the palest 
apple-jelly. 

Juice of red currants, 1 lb. ; apples (pared and cored), 1} lb.: 25 to 
SO minutes. Sugar, 1^ lb. : 20 minutes. 

Obs. — ^A portion of raspberries, if still in season, may be mixed with 
the currants for this g4teau, should their flavour be liked. 

JELLIES. 

CALF^S FEET JEIXT. (ENTREVKTB.) 

We hear inexperienced housekeepers frequently complain of the di^ 
ficulty of rendering this jelly perfectly transparent; but, by mixing 
with the other ingredients, while quite cold, the whites, and the crushed 
shells of a sufficient number of eggs, and allowing the head of scum 
which gathers on the jelly to remain undisturbed afler it once forms, 
they will scarcely fail to obtain it clear. It should be strained through 
a thick flannel-bag of a conical form (placed before the fire, should the 
weather be at all cold, or the mixture will jelly before it has run 
through), and if not perfectly clear it must be strained again and again 
until it becomes so; though we generally find that once suffices. Mix 
thoroughly in a large stewpan five half-pints of strong calf's-feet stock 
(see page 304,) a full pint of sherry, half a pound of sugar, roughly 
powdered, the juice of two fine lemons, the rind of one and a hal^ cut 
very thin, the whites and shells of four large eggs, and half an ounce of 
isinglass. Let these remain a few minutes off the fire, that the sugar 
may dissolve more easily; then let the jelly be brought to boil gradu- 
ally, and do not stir it after it begins to heat. When it has boileS gen- 
tly sixteen minutes, draw it from the fire, and let it stand a short time 
before it is poured into the jelly-bag, under which a bowl should be 

Elaiced to receive it. When clear and cool, put it into the moulds which 
ave been laid for some hours in water : these should always be of 
earthenware in preference to metal. If to be served in glasses, or 
roughed, the jelly will be sufficiently firm without the ismglass, of 
which, however, we recommend a small quantity to be thrown in always 
when the jelly begins to boil, as it focilitates the clearing. 

Calf's feet stock, 2^ pints; sugar, 4 lb.; sherry, 1 pint; juice of 
lemons, 2 large i rind of 1^; whites and shells of eggs, 4 large, or 5 
small : 16 minutes. 



810 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP. XX. 

Obs. 1. — After all the jelly has dropped throagh the bag, an exceed- 
ingly agreeable beverage may be obtained by pouring in some boiling 
water ; from one to three half-pints, according to the quantity of jeliy 
which has been made. The same plan should be pursued in making 
orange or lemon jelly for an invalid. 

Oos. 2. — As it IS essential to the transparency of calPs-feet jelly of 
all kinds that the whole of the ingredients should be quite cold when 
they are mixed, and as the stock can only be measured in a liquid state, 
to which it must be reduced by heating, the better plan is, to measure 
it when it is first strained from the ^t, and to put apart the exact 
quantity required for a receipt; but when this has not been done, and it 
is necessary to liquefy it, it must be left until quite cold again before it 
is used. 

ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR CALF^S FEET JELLY. 

To four calf's feet, well cleaned and divided, pour a gallon of water, 
and let them stew until it is reduced to rather less than two quarts ; or 
if, after the flesh has quite &llen from the bones, the liquor on being 
strained off should exceed that quantity, reduce it by rapid boiling in a 
clean uncovered pan over a very clear fire. When it is perfectly firm 
and cold, take it, clear of fat and sediment, and add to it a bottle of 
aherry, which should be of good quality (for poor, thin wines are not 
well adapted to the purpose), three quarters of a pound of sugar broken 
small, the juice of five lar^e or of six moderate-sized lemons, and the 
whites, with the shells nnelv crushed, of seven eggs, or of more, 
should they be very small The rinds of three lemons, pared exceed- 
ingly thin, may be thrown into the jelly a few minutes before it is taken 
from the fire ; or they may be put into the jelly-bag previously to its 
being poured through, when they will impart to it a slight and delicate 
flavour, without deepening its colour much. If it is to be moulded, 
something more than half an ounce of isinglass should be dropped 
ligrhtly in where the liquid becomes visible through the head of scum, 
when the mixture begins to boil ; for if not sufficiently firm, it wiU 
break when it is dished. It may be roughed, or served in glasses with- 
out this addition ; and in a liquid state will be found an i^mirable in- 
gredient for Oxford, or other punch. 

Calf's feet, 4; water, 1 gallon; to be reduced more than half. 
Sherry, 1 bottle ; sugar, | lb. (more to taste) ; juice of 5 large lemons, 
or of six moderate-sized; whites and shells of 7 ego^s, or more if small; 
rinds of lemons, 3 (for moulding, nearly j oz. of^isinglass) : 1.5 to 20 
minutes. 

Obs. — ^An excellent and wholesome jelly for young people may be 
made with good orange or raisin wine, instead of sherry ; to either of 
these the juice of three or four oranges, with a small portion of the 
rind, may be added instead of part of the lemons. 

APPLE calf's feet JELLT. 

Pour a quart of prepared apple-juice (see page 305) on a pound of 
fresh apples pared and cored, and simmer them until they are well 
broken ; strain the juice, and let it stand until cold ; then measure, and 
put a pint and a half of it into a stewpan with a quart of calf's feet 
stock (see page 304^, nine ounces of sugar broken small, or roughly 
pounded, the juice of^ two fine lemons, and the thin rinds of one and .a 



CHAP. XX.3 8WEET DISHES. 811 

halC with the whites and shells of eight egffs. Let it boil gently for 
ten minutes, then strain it through a nannel-bag, and when cool put it 
into moulds. It will be very clear, and firm, and of pleasant flavour. 
Apples of good quality should be used for it, and the quantity of sugar 
must be regulated by the time of year,, as the fruit will have lost much 
of its acidity during the latter part of the season. This receipt, which 
is the result of our own experiment, and which we have found very suc- 
cessful, was first tried just after Christmas, with pippina A little syrup 
of preserved ginger, or a small glass of fine white brandy, would per- 
haps, to some tastes, improve the jelly ; but we give it simply as we 
have had it proved ourselves. 

Prepared apple juice, 1 quart; fresh apples, 1 lb.: i to } hour. 
Strained juice, 1^ pint; calf's feet stock, 1 quart; sugar, 9 ozs. ; juice 
of lemons, 2 ; rind of 1^ ; whites and shells of eggs, 8 : 10 minutes. 

Obs, — We would recommend the substitution of quinces for apples 
in this receipt as likely to hfSsrd a very agreeable variety of the jelly : 
or equal portions of ttie two fruits might answer well. 

Unless the stock be very stifll^ add isinglass to this, as to the cairs 
feet jelly, when it is to be moulded. 

ORANGE CAIiF's FEET JELLT. 

To a pint and a half of firm calf's feet stock, put a pint of strained 
China orange-juice; mixed with that of one or two lemons ; add to these 
six ounces of sugar, broken small, the very thin rinds of three oranges 
and of one lemon, and the whites of six eggs with half the shells crushed 
small. Stir these gently over a clear fire until the head of scum begins 
to form, but not at all afterwards. Simmer the jelly for ten minutes 
from the first ftdl boil ; take it from the fire, let it stand a little, then 
pour it through a jelly-bag until perfectly clear. This is an original, 
and entirely new receipt, which we can recommend to the reader, the 
jelly being very pale, beautifully transparent, and delicate in flavour : 
it would, we think, be peculiarly acceptable to such invalids as are for- 
bidden to take wine in anv form. 

The proportions both of sugar and of lemon-juice must be somewhat 
varied according to the season in which the oranges are used. 

Strong calf's feet stock, 1^ pint; strained orange-juice, mixed witli 
a small portion of lemon-juice, 1 pint; sugar, 6 ozs. ; rinds of oranges, 
8 ; of lemon, 1 : 10 minutes. 

Obs, — ^A small pinch of isinglass thrown into the jelly when it begins 
to boil will much assist to clear it. When the flavour of Seville oranges 
is liked, two or three can be used with the sweet ones. 

ORANGE ISINGLASS JELLT. 

To render this perfectly transparent the juice of the fruit must be 
filtered, and the isinglass clarified ; but it is not usual tc take so much 
trouble for it. Strain as clear as possible, first through a sieve or mus- 
lin, then through a thick cloth or jelly-bag[, one quart of orange-juice, 
mixed with as much lemon-juice as will give an agreeable degree of 
acidity. Dissolve two ounces and a half of isinglass in a pint of water, 
skim it well, throw in half a pound of sugar, and a few strips of the 
orange-rind, pour in the orange-juice, stir the whole well together, skim 
it. clean without allowing it to boil, strain it through a cloth or throuffh 
a muslin, many times folded, and when nearly cold put it into the

Infuse in a pint of water for five minutes the rind of half a Seville

this IS dissolved throw in four ounces of good sugar in lumps; stir well, 
and simmer the whole for a few minutes, then mix with it four large 
wineglassesflil of Constantia, and strain the jelly through a fine cloth 
of close texture; let it settle and cool, then pour it gently from any 
sediment there may be, into a mould which ha$i been laid fbr an hour or 
two into water. We had this jelly made in the first instance for an

SrrRAWBEItRT ISINGLASS JELLT. 

A ffreat variety of equally elegant and excellent jellies for the table 
may be made with clarified isinglass, clear syrup, and the juice of almost 
any kind of fresh fruit; but as the process of making them is nearly the 
same for all, we shall limit our receipts to one or two, which will serve 
to direct the makers fbr the rest Boil together quickly for fifteen mi- 
nutes one pint of water and three quarters of a pound of very good sugar ; 
measure a quart of ripe richly-flavoured strawberries without uieir 
stalks; the scarlet answer best from the colour which theyjrive; oa 
these pour the boiling syrup, and let them stand all night The next 
day clarify two ounces and a half of isine^lass in a pint of vvater, as di- 
rected at the beginninfiT of this chapter; drain the syrup from the straw- 
berries very closely, add to it two or three tablespoonsful of red currant 
juice, and the dear juice of one large or of two small lemons ; and 
when the isinglass is nearly cold mix the whole, and put it into moulds. 
The French, who excel in these fruit-jellies, always mix the separate 
ingredients when they are almost cold ; and they also place them over 
ice for an hour or so after they are moulded, which is a great advantage, 
as they then require less isinglass, and are in consequence much more 
delicate. When the fruit abounds, instead of throwing it into the syrup, 
bruise lightlv from three to four pints, throw two tablespoonsful of sugar 
over it, and let the juice flow from it for an hour or two ; then pour a 
little water over, and use the juice without boiling, which will give a 
jelly of finer flavour than the other. 

Water, 1 pint; sugar, j lb.: 15 minutes. Strawberries, 1 quart; 
isinglass, 2^ ozs. ; water, 1 pint (white of egg 1 to 2 teaspooniBfii]) ; 
juice, 1 large or 2 small lemons. 

. Obs, — The juice of any fruit mixed with sufiicient sugar to sweeten, 
and of isinglass to stiffen it, with as much lemon-juice as will take off 
the insipidity of the flavour, will serve for this kind of jell]^. Pine- 
apples, peaches, and such other fruits as do not yield much juice, must 
M infused in a larger quantity of syrup, which must then be vaed in

To ffive greater transparency of 'appearance to jelly, it is often made 
in a mould with a cylindrical tube in the centre. The space left m ^

pose, with another of smaller size fixed in it by means of slight wires, 
Which hook on to the edge of the outer one. By pouring water into 
this it may easily be detached from the jelly ; the fruit w then to be 
placed in the space left by it, and the whole filled up wjth jAore jelly,

QUEEN mab's pudding ; (an elegant summer dish.) 
Throw into a pint of new milk the thin rind of a small lemon, and 
six or eight bitter almonds, blanched and bruised ; or substitute for 
these half a pod of vanilla, cut small, heat it slowly by the side of the 
fire, and keep it at the point of boilmg until it is strongly flavoured, 
then add a small pinch of salt, and three quarters of an ounce of the 
finest isinglass, or a full ounce should the weather be extremely warm; 
when this is dissolved, strain the milk through a muslin, and put it into 
a clean saucepan, with four ounces and a half of sugar in lumps, and 
half a pint of rich cream ; give the whole one boil, and then stir it 
briskly and by degrees to the well-beaten yolks of six fi-esh eggs; nex^ 
thicken the mixture as a custard, over a gentle fire, but do not hazard 
its curdling; when it is of tolerable consistency, pour it out, and con- 
tinue the stirring until it is half cold, then mix with it an ounce and a 
half of candied citron, cut in small spikes, and a couple of ounces of 
dried cherries, and pour it into a mould rubbed with a drop of oil: 
when turned out it will have the* appearance of a pudding. From two 
to three ounces of preserved ginger, well drained and sliced, may be 
substituted for the cherries, and an ounce of pistachio-nuts, blanched 
and split, for the citron ; these will make an elegant variety of the dish, 
and the syrup of the ginger, poured round as sauce, will be a further 
improvement. Currants steamed until tender, and candjed orange or 
lemon-rind, are often used instead of the cherries, and the well-sweet- 
ened juice of strawberries, raspberries (white or red), apricots, peaches, 
or syrup of pine-apple, will make an agreeable sauce ; a small quan- 
tity of this last will also give a delicious flavour to the pudding itself 
when mixed with the other ingredients. Cream may be substituted 
entirely for the milk, when its richness is considered desirable. 



CHAP. XZ.3 SWEET DISHES. 315 

New milk, 1 pint ; rind 1 small lemon ; bitter almonds, 6 to 8 (or, 
vanilla, i pod) ; salt, few grains ; isinglass, j oz. (1 oz. in sultry wea^ 
ther) ; sugar, 4^ oz. ; cream, ^ pint; yolks, 6 eggs ; dried cherries, 2ozs. ; 
candied citron, 1^ oz.; (or preserved ginger, 2 to 3 ozs., and the syrup 
as sauce, and 1 oz. of blanched pistachio-nuts; or 4 ozs. currants, 
steamed 20 minutes, and 2 ozs. candied orange-rind). For sauce, 
sweetened juice of strawberries, raspberries, or plums, or pine-apple 
syrup. 

Obs. — The currants should be steamed in an earthen cullender, 
placed over a saucepan of boiling water, and covered with the lid. It 
will be a great improvement to place the pudding over ice for an hour 
before it is served. 

NESSELRODE CREAM. 

Shell and blanch twenty-four fine Spanish chestnuts, and put them 
with three quarters of a pint of water into a small and delicately clean 
saucepan. When they have simmered from six to eight minutes, add to 
them two ounces of line sugar, and let them stew very gently until they 
are perfectly tender; then drain them from the water, pound them, 
while still warm, to a smooth pastef and press them through the back 
of a fine sieve. While this is being done, dissolve half an ounce of 
isinglass in two or three spoonsful of water, and put to it as much cream 
as will, with the small quantity of water used, make half a pint ; two 
ounces of sugar, about the third of a pod of vanilla, cut small, and well 
bruised, and a strip or two of fresh lemon-rind, pared extremely thin. 
Give these a minute^s boil, and then keep them quite hot by the side of 
the fire, until a strong flavour of the vanilla is obtained. Now, mix 
gradually with the chestnuts half a pint of rich, unboiled cream, strain 
the other half pint through a fine muslin, and work the whole well to- 
gether until it becomes very thick ; then stir to it a couple of ounces 
of dried cherries, cut into quarters, and two of candied citron, divided 
into very small dice. Press the mixture into a mould which has been 
rubbed with a particle of the purest salad-oil, and in a few hours it will 
be ready for table. The cream should be sufficiently stifij when the 
fruit is added, to prevent its sinking to the bottom, and both kinds should 
be dry when they are used. 

Chestnuts, large, 24; water, | pint; sugar, 2 ozs. ; isinglass, ^ oz. ; 
water, 3 to 4 tablespoonsful ; cream, nearly ^ pint ; vanilla, 4 of pod ; 
lemon-rind, |^ of 1 large : infuse 20 minutes or more. Unboiled cream, 
i pint I dried cherries, 2 ozs. ; candied citron, 2 ozs. 

Obs. — When vanilla cannot easily be obtained, a little noyeau may 
be substituted for it, but a full weight of isinglass must then be used. 
This receipt is entirely new, and our directions must be followed with 
exactness, should the reader wish to ensure its success. 

AN EXCELLENT TRIFLE. 

Take equal parts of wine and brandy, about a wineglassful of each, 
or two thirds of good sherry or Madeira, and one or spirit, and soak in 
the mixture four sponge-biscuits, and half a pound of macaroons; cover 
the bottom of the trifle-dish with part of these, and pour upon them a 
fiill pint of rich boiled custard made with three quarters of a pint, or 
tether more, of milk and cream taken in equal portions, and six eggs ; 
and sweetened, flavoured and thickened by the receipt of page 322 ; 
lay the Bemainder of the soaked cakes upon it, and pile over the whole,

Flavour pleasantly with lemon-rlnd and cinnamon a pint of rich 
cream, after having taken thim it as much as will mix smoothly to a 
thin batter Ibur teaspoonsful of Che finest Sour; sweeten it with six 
ounces of well-refined sugar, in lumps; place it over a clear fire in a 
delicately clean saucepan, and when it boils stir in the flour, and sim* 
mer it for firar or flve minutes, stirring it gentlj without ceasing ; then 
pour it out, and when it is quite cold mix with it by degrees the strained 
juice of two moderate^izc^ and very fresh lemons. Take a quarter of 
a pound of mabaroons, covet' the bottom of a glass dish with a portion 
of^ them, pour in a part of the cream, lay the remainder of the maca- 
roons upon it, add the rest of the cream, and ornament it with candied 
citron, sliced thin. It should be made the, day before it is wanted for 
table. The requisite flavour may be given to this dish b^ infusing ia 
the cream the very thin rind of alemon, and part of a stick of cinna- 
mon, slightly bruised, and Chen straining it before the flour ia added ; or, 
these and the sugar may be boiled together, with two or three spoonsfiii 
of water, to a strongly flavoured syrup, which, after having been passed 
through a muslin strsiner, may be stirred into the cream. Some cooks 
boil the cinnamon and the gratfd rind of a lemon with all the other 
ingredients, but the cream has then to be pressed through a sieve after 
it IS made, a process which it is always desirable to avoid. 

Rich cream, 1 pint ; sugar, 6 ozs. ; rind, 1 lemon ; cmnamon, 1 
drachm; flour, 4 teaspoonsjlil ; juice, 2 lemons; macaroon^ 4 o«s. ,

wanted, then fill it hig^h with whipped strawberry cream which has been 
drained on a sieve from the precedinsr day, and stick very fine ripe 
strawberries over it. It should not he filled until just before it is 
served. 

CREHE MERINOUEE. 

Infiise in a pint of new milk the very thin rind of a lemon, with four 
or five bitter almonds bruised. As the quantity should not be reduced, 
it should be kept by the side of the fire until strongly flavoured, and not 
be allowed to boil for more than two or three minutes. Sweeten it with 
tliree ounces of fine sugar in lumps, and when this is dissolved, strain, 
and mix the milk with half a pint of cream ; then stir the whole gra- 
dually to the well-beaten yolks of six firesh eggs, and thicken it like 
boiled custard. Put it, when cold, into a deep dish, beat to a solid fi*oth 
the whites of six eggs, mix them with five tablespoonsful of pounded 
and sifted sugar, and spread them evenly over the custard, which should 
be set immediately into a moderate oven, baked half an hour, and 
served directly it is taken out. 

New milk, 1 pint ; rind of one lemon ; bitter almonds, 5 ; sugar, 3 
Qzs.; cream, ^ pint; yolks of eggs, 6; frothed whites of eggs, 6; 
sifted sugar, 5 tablespoonsfiil : baked, | hour. 

Obs, — A layer of apricot, peach, or magnum bonum, marmalade 
placed in the dish before the custard-mixture is poured in will convert 
this into the gentleman commoner's pudding. 

LEMON CREAM, MADE WITHOUT CREAM. 

Pour on the very thin rinds of two fresh lemons, and a pound of fine 
sugar broken small, or roughly powdered, one pint of boiling water, and 
let them remain an hour; then add the whites of six eggs and the yolks 
of two, previously well beaten together, and the juice of six lemons ; 
mix them tlioroughly, strain the whole into a deep jug, set this into a 
pan of boiling water, and stir the cream without quitting it until it is 
well thickened ; pour it out, and continue the stirring at intervals until 
it is nearly cold, when it may be put into the glasses. In cool weather 
this cream will remain good ibr several days, and it should always be 
made at least twenty-fbnr hours before it is served. 

Lemon-rinds, 2 ; sugar, 1 lb. ; water, 1 pint : 1 hour. Whites of 6 
eggs ; yolks of 2 ; juice of 6 lemons. 

VERT GOOD LEMON CREAMS. 

Pour over the very tliin rinds of two moderate-sized but perfectly 
sound fresh lemons, and six ounces of sugar, half a pint of spring water, 
and let them remain six hours; then add the strained juice of the 
lemons, and five fresh eggs well beaten, and also strained ; take out the 
lemon-rind, and stir the mixture willlout ceasing over a gentle fire until 
it has boiled softly from six to eight minutes : it will not curdle as it 
would did milk supply the place of the water and lemon-juice. The 
creams are, we think, more delicate, tnough not quite so thick, when 
the yolks only of six eggs are used for them. They will keep well for 
nearly a week in really cold weather. 

Rinds of lemons, 2 ; sugar, 6 ozs. (or 8 when a very sweet dish is 
preferred) ; cold water, ^ pint : 6 hours. Juice of lemons, 2 ; eggs, 5 .'

06«.-»Lemon creams may, on occaBion, be more expeelitioasly pre* 
pared, by rasping the rind of the fruit upon the sugar which is used for 
them ; or, by paring it thin, and boiling it for a few minutes with the 
kmon-juice, sugar, and water, before they are stirred to the eggs. 

FRUIT CREAMS, AMD ITALIAN CREAMS. 

These are very quickly and easily made, by mixing with good cream 
a sufficient proportion of the sweetened juice of fresh fruit, or of well- 
made fruit jelly or jam, to flavour it : a few dn^ of prepared cochineal 
may be added to deepen the colour when it is required for any particular 
purpose. A quarter-pint of strawberry or oi raspberry jelly will fully 
flavour a pint of cream: a very little lemon-juice improves almost all 
compositions of this sort When jam is used it must first be gradually 
mixe4 with the cream, and then worked through a sieve, to vike out the 
seed or skin of the fruit All fresh juice, for this purpose, must, of 
course, be cold ; that of strawberries is best obtained by crushing the 
fruit and strewing sugar over it Peaches, pine-apple, apricots, or nec- 
tarines, may be simmered for a few minutes in a little syrup, and thisy 
drained well from them, will serve extremely well to mix with the 
cream when it has become thoroughly cold : the lemon-juice should be 
added to all of these. When the ingredients are well blended, lightly 
whisk or mill them to a froth ; take this off with a skimmer as it rises, 
and lay it upon a fine sieve reversed, to drain, or if it is to be served in 
glasses, fill them with it at once. 

Italian creams are eitiier fruit-flavoured only, or mixed with wine 
like syllabubs, then whisked to a stiff froth and put into a perforated 
mould, into which a muslin is first laid : or into a small hair-sieve (which 
must also first be Imed with the muslin), and left to drain until the fol- 
lowing day, when the cream must be very gently turned out, and dished, 
and garnished as fancy may direct 

VERT SUPERIOR WHIPPED SYLLABUBS. 

Weigh seven ounces of fine sugar and rasp on it the rinds of two 
fresh sound lemons of good size, then pound or roll it to powder, and put 
it into a bowl with the strained juice of the lemons, two large glasses 
of sherry, and two of brandy ; when the sugar is nearly or quite dis- 
solved add a pint of rich cream, and whisk or mill the mixture well ; 
take off the froth as it rises, and put it into glasses. These syllabubs 
will remain good for several days, and should always be made, if possi- 
ble, four and twenty hours before they are wanted for table. The full 
flavour of the lemon-rind is obtained with less trouble than in rasping, 
by paring it very thin indeed, and infusing it lor some hours in the 
juice of the fruit. 

Sugar, 7 ozs.; rind and juioe of lemons, 2; sherry, 2 large wine- 
glassesful ; brandy, 2 wineglassesful ; oream, 1 pint 

06s.— These proportions are sufficient for two dozens or more of syl- 
labubs : they are often made with almost equal quantities of wine and 
cream, but are certainly neither so good nor so wholesome without a 
portion of brandy.

QUINCE BLAMANGE. (DelicWUS.) 

This, if carefully made, and with ripe quinces, is one of the most 
richly-flavoured preparations of fruit that we have ever tasted ; and the 
receipt, we may venture to say, will be altogether new to the reader. 
Dissolve in a pint of prepared juice of quinces (see page 305), an ounce 
of the best isinglass; next, add ten ounces of sugar, roughly pounded, 
and stir these together gently over a. clear fire, from twenty to thirty 
minutes, or until the juice jellies in falling from the spoon. Remove 
the scum carefully, and pour the boiling jelly gradually to half a pint 
of thick cream, stirring them briskly together as they are mixed : they 
must be stirred until very nearly cold, and then poured into a mould 
which has been rubbed in every part with the smallest possible quantity 
of very pure salad oil, or, if more convenient, into one that has been 
dipped into cold water.

QUINCE BLAMANOE, WITH ALMOND CREAM. 

When cream is not procurable, which will sometimes happen in the 
depth of winter, almonds, if plentifully used, will afford a very good sub- 
stitute, though the finer blamange is made from the foregoing receipt. 
On four ounces of almonds, blanched and beaten to the smoothest paste, 
and moistened in the pounding with a few drops of water, to prevent 
their oiling, pour a pint of boiling quince-juice; stir them together, and 
turn them into a strong cloth, of which let the ends be held and twisted 
difierent ways b^r two persons^ to express the cream from the almonds , 
put the juice again on the fire, with half a pound of sugar, and when it 
tioils, throw in nearly an ounce of fine isinglass ; simmer the whole for 
five minutes, take on the scum, stir the blamange until it is nearly cold, 
then mould it for table. Increase the quantity both of this and of the 
preceding blamange, when a large dish of either is required.

1 oz. : 5 minutes. 

APRICOT BLAMAlfOE, OR CREME PARISIENNE. 

Dissolve gently an ounce of fine isinglass in a pint of new milk or ol 
thin cream, and strain it through a folded muslin ; put it into a clean 
saucepan, with three ounces of sugar, broken into small lumps, and 
when it boils, stir to it half a pint of rich cream ; add it, at first, by 
spoonsful only, to eight ounces of the finest apricot jam, mix them very 
smoothly, and stir the whole until it is nearly cold, that tiie jam maT 
not sink to the bottom of the mould: a taUespoonful of lemon-juice wiU

When cream is scirce, use milk instead, with an additional quarter- 
ooQce of iaingkss, and enrich it by pouVing it boiling on the same pro- 
portion of almonds as for the second quince blamange (see page 3'JO). 
Cream can in all cases be substituted entirely Ibr the milk, when a very 
licb preparation is desired. Peach jam will answer admirably ibr thn

HiAHANGB srsANE, OR, mttPBD BL^MAHOB. 

Make in the ordinary way, but a little firmer, one quart or two of 
blamange, according to the number of moulds thut are to be filled ; di- 
vide it into three or four equal portions; add to one, sufficient prepared 
spinach-juice (see page 305), to colour it a full or a pale green; to ano- 
ther, some liquid cochineal or carmine; to a third, should further va- 
riety be desired, a few drops of strong infusion of saffron, or if its peculiar 
flavour be objected to, stir quickly some of the blamange quite boiling 
to the well-bealen yolks or three or four fresh eggs, and thicken it a 
little over a gentle lire with an additional spoonhil or two of milk, for 
unless the whole be nearly of the same consistency, it will be liable to 
separate in tlie unmDulding. Chocolate, flrst boiled very smooth in a 
small quantity of water, will give nn additional colonr; and some firm, 
clear isinglass, or calf 's-tbot jelly, may be used ibr an occasional stripe, 
where great variety is desired. Thedifierent kinds of blamange should 
be poupsd into the mould in half-inch depths, when so cool as to be onlv 
just liquid, and one colour must be perfectly cold before another is added, 
or they will run together, and spoil the appearance of the dish. When 
ice is not procurable, the moulds in warm weather mav be set into 
water, mixed with plenty of salt and saltpetre : the iosides should be 
rubbed with a drop of very pure salad oil, insteadof being laid into fresh 
water, as usual.

beaten to a very solid froth, and mixed willi two heaped tablespoonsful 
of sugar, must then be spread evenly over the siiodoise, fine sugar siiled

the almonds are browned, but not too deeply, «nd the apples are hot 
tlirough. It is not easy to give the required form with less than fifteen 
apples; eight of these may first be simmered in a syrup made with lialf 
a pint of water and six ounces of sugar, and the remainder may be 
thrown in after these are lifted out. Care must be taken to keep them 
firm. The marmalade should be sweet, and pleasantly flavoured with 
lemon. 

IMPEBIAIi OOOSEBERRT-FOOL. 

Simmer a pound of green gooseberries which have been freed from 
the buds and stalks, in three-quarters of a pint of water, until they are 
well broken, then strain thetn, and to half a pound of the juice add half 
a pound of sugar, broken small : boil these together for fifteen minute& 
Dissolve half an ounce of isinglass in a quarter-pint of rich cream, pour 
them into a basin, and stir them till only lukewarm, then mix them by 
degrees with the sugar and gooseberry-juice, which should also have 
been allowed to cool ; add the strained juice of half a small lemon, and 
mould the mixture, which should stand at least twelve hours, in a cool 
place, before it is turned out 

These proportions are sufficient for a small mould only, and must be 
doubled for a lar^e one. The dish is too sweet for our own taste, but 
as it has been highly approved by several persons who have tasted it, 
we give the receipt exactly as we had it tried in the first instance : it 
will be found extremely easy to vary it 

VERT GOOD OLD-FASHIONED BOILED CUSTARD. 

Throw into a pint and a half of new milk, the very thin rind of a 
fresh lemon, and let it infuse for half an hour, then simmer them 
together for a few minutes, and add four ounces and a half of white 
sugar. Beat thoroughly the yolks of fourteen fresh eggs, mix with 
them another half-pmt of new milk, stir the boiling oailk quickly to 
them, take out the lemon-peel, and turn the custard into a deep jug ; set 
this over the fire in a pan of boiling water, and keep the custard stirred 
gently, but without ceasing, until it begins to thicken; then move the 
spoon rather more quickly, making it always touch the bottom of the 
jug, until the mixture is brought to the point of boiling, when it must 
be instantly taken from the fire, or it will curdle in a moment Pour it 
into a bowl, and keep it stirred until nearly cold, then add to it by de- 
grees a wineglassful of good brandy, and two ounces of blanched 
almonds, cut into spikes; or omit these, at pleasure. A few bitter ones, 
bruised, can be boiled in the milk in lieu of lemon-peel, when their fla- 
vour is preferred. 

New milk, 1 quart; rind of 1 lemon; sugar, 4i ozs.; yolks of eggs, 
14 ; salt, ^ saltspoonful. 

RICH BOILED CUSTARD. 

Take a small cupful from a quart of fresh cream, and simmer the 
remainder for a few minutes with four ounces of sugar and thie rind of 
a lemon, or give it any other flavour that may be preferred. Beat and 
strain the yolks of eight eggs, mix them with the cupful of cream, and 
stir the rest boiling to them : thicken the custard like the preceding 
one. 

Cream, 1 quart ; sugar, 4 ozs. ; yolks of eggs, 8. 



CHAP. XX.^ SWEET DISHES. 323 

THE queen's CUBTARD. 

On the beaten and strained yolks, of twelve new-laid eggs pour a 
pint and a half of boiling cream which has been sweetened, with three 
ounces of sugar; add the smallest pinch of salt, and thicken the custard 
as usual. When nearly cold, flavour it with a glass and a half of no- 
yeau, maraschino, or cuirasseau; add the sliced almonds or not, at 
pleasure. 

Yolks of eggs, 12; cream, 1} pint; sugar, 3 ozs. ; little salt; noyeau 
maraschino, or cuirasseau, 1} wineglassful. 

CURRANT CUSTARD. 

Boil in a pint of clear currant-juice ten ounces of sugar for three 
minutes, take off the scum, and pour the boiling juice on eight well- 
beaten eggs ; thicken the custard in a jug set into a pan of water, pour 
it out, stir it till nearly cold, then add to it carefully, and by degrees, 
half a pint of rich cream, and last of all two tablespoonsful of strained 
lemon-juice. When the currants are very ripe, omit one ounce of the 
suffar. 

White currants and strawberries, cherries, red or white raspberries, 
or a mixture of any of these fruits, may be used for these custards with 
good effect : they are excellent 

Currant-juice, 1 pint ; sugar, 10 ozs. : 3 minutes. Eggs, 8 ; cream, 
i pint ; lemon-juice, 2 tablespoonsful. 

QUINCE OR APPLE CUSTARDS. 

Add to a pint of apple-jpice prepared as for jelly, a tablespoonful of 
strained lemon-juice, and from four to six ounces of sugar according to 
the acidity of the fruit ; stir these boiling, quickly, and in small por- 
tions, to eight well-beaten eggs, and thicken the custard in a jug placed 
in a pan of boiling water, in the usual manner. A large proportion of 
lemon-juica and a high flavouring of the rind can be given when ap- 
proved. For quince custards, which if well made are excellent, observe 
the same directions as for the apple, but omit the lemon-juice. As we 
have before observed, alLcustards are much finer when made with the 
yolks only of the eggs, of which the number must be increased nearly 
half, when this is done. 

Prepared apple-juice (see page 305), 1 pint ; lemon-juice, 1 table- 
spoonful ; sugar, 4 to 6 ozs. ; eggs, 8. Quince custards, same propor- 
tions, but no lemon-juice. 

Obs. — In making lemon-creams the apple-juice may be substituted 
very advantageously for water, without varying the receipt in other 
respects, 

CHOCOIJITE CUSTARDS. 

Dissolve gently by the side of the fire an ounce and a half of the 
beet chocolate in rather more than a wineglassful of water, and then 
boil it until it is perfectly smooth ; mix with it a pint of milk well fla- 
voured with lemon-peel or vanilla, add two ounces of fine sugar, and 
when the whole boils, stir it to five well-beaten eggs that have been 
strained. Put the custard into a jar or jug, set it into a pan of boiling 
water, and stir it without ceasing until it is thick. Do not put it into 
glasses or a dish till nearly or quite cold. These, as well as all other 
' custards, are mfiaitely finer when made with the yolks only of the eggs. 



:I94 MODERN COOKXBY. []CHAP. 

of whicQ the number must then be increased. Two ounces of choco- 
late, a pint of milk, half a pint of cream, two ounces and a half or three 
ounces of Bugar, and eight yolks of egg;s, will make very superior cus- 
tards of this kind. 

Rasped chocolate, IJoz. ; y\rater, 1 Zar^e wineglassful : 5 to 8 mi- 
nutes. New milk, 1 pint ; eggs, 5 ; sugar, 2 ozs. Or, chocolate, 2 
ozs. ; water, i pint; new milk, 1 pint: sugar, 2^ to 3 ozs. ; cream, ^ 
pint; yolks of eggs, 8. 

Ol>8. — Either of these msiv be moulded by dissolving from half to 
three quarters of an ounce of isinglass in the milk. The proportion of 
ch<x;olate can be increased to the taste. 

COMMON BAKED CUSTAAD. 

Mix a quart of new milk with eight well-beaten eggs, strain the 
mixture through a fine sieve, and sweeten it with irom five to eight 
ounces of sugar, according to the taste ; add a small pinch of salt, and 
pour the custard into a deep dish with or without a lining or rim of 
paste, grate nutmeg or lemon rind over the top, and bake it in a very 
slow oven from twenty to thirty minutes, or longer, should it not be 
firm in the centre. A custard, if well made, and properly baked, will 
be quite smooth when cut, without the honey-combed appearance which 
a hot oven gives; and there will be no whey in the dish. 

New milk, 1 quart; eggs, 8; sugar, 5 to 8 ozs.; salt, ) salt-spoon* 
ful ; nutmeg or lemon-grate : baked, slow oven, 20 to 30 minutes, or 
more. 

A FINER BAKED CUSTARD. 

Boil together gently, for five minutes, a pint and a half of new milk, 
a few grains of salt, the very thin rind of a lemon, and six ounces of 
loaf sugar; stir these boiling, but very gradually to the well-beaten 
yolks of ten fresh eggs, and the whites of four ; strain the mixture, and 
add to it half a pint of good cream ; let it cool, and then flavour it with 
a few spoonsful of brandy, or a little ratafia ; finish and bake it by the 
directions given for the common cnstard above; or pour it into small 
well-buttered cups, and bake it very slowly from ten to twelve minutes. 

FRENCH CUSTARDS. 

To a quart of new milk allow the yolks of twelve fresh eggs, but to 
equal parts of milk and cream of ten only. From six to eight ounces 
of sugar will sweeten the custtfrd sufficiently for general taste, but more 
can be added at will ; boil this for a few minutes gently in the milk 
with a ^rain or two of^ salt, and stir the mixture briskly to the eggs, as 
soon as it is taken from the fire. Butter a round deep dish, pour in the 
custard, and place it in a pan of water at the point of boiling, taking 
care that it shall not reach to within an inch of the edge ; ^et it just 
simmer, and no more, from an hour to an hour and a half: when quite 
firm in the middle, it will be done. A very few live embers should be 
kept on the lid of the stewpan to prevent the steam falling from it into 
the custard. When none is at hand of a form to allow of this, it is bet* 
ter to use a charcoal fire, and to lay an oven-leaf, or tin, over the pan, 
and the embers in the centre. The small French furnace, shown iti 
Chapter XXL, is exceedingly convenient for preparations of this kind ; 
and there is always more or leas of difficulty m keeping a ood Sn en-

tirely free from mioke for any length of time. Serve the eustard coldi 
with chopped macaroons, or ratafias, laid thickly round the edge so as 
to form a border an inch deep. A few petals of fresh orang^bloseoni 
infused in the milfr, will give it a most agreeable flavour, very superior 
to that derived from the distilled water. Half a pod of vanilla, cut in 
short lengths, and well bruised, may be used instead of either; but the 
milk should then stand some time by the fire before or after it boila, and 
it must be strained through a muslin before it is added to the eggs, as 
the small seed of the vanilla would probably pass through a sieve. 

New milk, 1 quart; yolks of eggs, 12; sugar, 6 to 8 ozs. Or, new 
milk, 1 pint ; cream, 1 pint ; yolks of eggs, 10 ; flavouring of orange- 
flowers or vanilla: simmered in water-baUi, 1 to 1^ hour. 

GERMAN PUFFS. 

Pound to a perfectly smooth paste two ounces of sweet alroonds and 
six bitter ones ; mix with them, by slow degrees, the yolks of six, ^nd 
the whites of three eggs. ^Dissolve in half a pint of rich cream, four 
ounces of fresh butter, and two of fine sugar ; pour tliese hot to the 
eggs, stirring them briskly together, and when the mixture has become 
cool, flavour it with half a glass of brandy, or of orange-flower water; 
or, in lieu of either, with a little lemon-brandy. Butter some cups 
thickly, and strew into them a few slices of candied citron, or orange 
rind ; pour in the mixture, and bake thd pufi& twenty minutes, in a slow 
oven. 

Sweet almonds, 2 ozs. ; hitter almonds, 6 ; e^gs, whites, 3, — ^yolks, 
6; cream, | pint; butter, 4 ozs. ; sugar, 2 ozs.; l)randy, cuirasseau, or 
orange-flower water, ^ wineglassful (or little lemon-brandy): 20 mi« 
nutes, slow oven. 

RASPBERRY PI7FF3. 

Roll out thin some fine puff-paste, cut it in rounds or squares of equal 
size, lay some raspberry jam into each, moisten the edges of the paste^ 
fold and press them together, and bake the puf& from ten to fifteen mi* 
nutes. Strawberry, or any other jam will serve for them equally welL 

CREAMED TARTLETS. 

Line some pattypans with very fine paste, and puf into each a layer 
of apricot jam ; on this poyr some thick-boiled custard, or the pastry, 
cream of page 267. Whisk the whites of a couple of eggs to a solid 
froth, mix a couple of taUespoonsful of sifted sugar with them, lay this 
icing lightly over the tartlets, and bake them in a gentle oven from 
twenty to thirty minutes, unless they should be very small, when less 
time must be allowed for them. 

AN APPLE CHARLOTTE, OR CHARLOTTE DES POMMES. 

Butter a plain mould (a round or square cake-tin will answer th# 
purpose quite well), and line it entirely with thin slices of the cramb 
of a stale loaf, cut so as to fit iijto it with s^eat exactness, and dipped 
into clarified butter. When this is done, fill the mould to the brim with 
apple marmalade ; cover the top with slices of bread dipped in butter, 
•and on these place a dish, a large plate, or the cover of a stewpan with 
a weight upon it Send the charlotte to a brisk oven for three quarters 
of an hoar should it be small, and for an hour if large. Turn it out with

d96 MODERN COOKERY. QcHAP. XX. 

^reat care, and aenre it hot If baked in a slack oven it will not take 
a proper degree of colour, and it will be liable to break in the dishingr. 
The strips of bread must of course join very perfectly, for if any spaces 
were left between them the syrup of the fruit would escape, and de- 
stroy the good appearance of the dish : should there not have been suffi- 
cient marmalade prepared to fill the mould entirely, a jar of quince or 
apricot jam, or of preserved cherries even, may be added to it with 
advantage. The butter should be well drained from the charlotte before 
it is taken from the mould ; and sugar may be sifted thickly over it be- 
fore it is served, or it may be covered with any kind of clear red jelly. 

A more elegant, and we think an easier mode of forming the crust, 
is to line the mould with small rounds of bread stamped out with a 
plain cake, or paste-cutter, then dipped in butter, and placed with the 
ed^es sufficiently one over the other to hold the fruit securely: the 
•trips of bread are sometimes arranged in the same way. 

I to 1 hour, quick oven. 

MARMALADE FOR THE CHARLOTTE. 

Weigh three pounds of good boilinjr apples, after they have been 
pared, cored, and quartered ; put them into a stewpan with six ounces 
of fresh butter, three quarters of a pound of sugar beaten to powder, 
three quarters of a teaspoooful of pounded cinnamon, and the strained 
juice of a lemon : let these stew over a gentle fire, until they form a 
perfectly smooth and dry marmalade ; keep them often stirred that they 
may not burn, and let them cool befbre they are put into the crust This 
quantity is for a moderate-sized charlotte. 

A CHARLOTTE A LA FARISIENNE. 

This dish is sometimes called a Vienna cake ; and it is known also^ 
we believe, as a Gateaux de Bordeaux. Cut horizontally into half-inch 
slices a sponge cake, and cover each slice with a different kind of pre- 
serve ; replace them in their original form, and spread equally over the 
cake an icing made with the whites of three eggs, and four ounces of 
the finest pounded sugar ;, sift more sugar over it in every part, and pat 
it into a very slack oven to dry. The eggs should be whisked to snow 
befbre they are used. One kind of preserve, instead of several,, can be 
used for this dish ; and a rice or a pound cake may, on an emergency, 
supply the place of the Savoy, or sponge biscuit 

A GERTRUDE A LA CREME. 

Slice a plain pound or rice cake as for the Charlotte d la Parinenne^ 
and take a round out of the centre of each slice with a tin-cutter befbre 
the preserve is laid on ; replace the whole in its original form, ice the 
outside with a green or rose-coloured icing at pleasure, and dry it in a 
^ntle oven ; or decorate it instead with leaves of almond paste, fasten- 
ing them to it with white of ^g. Just before it is sent to table, fill it 
with well-drained whipped cream, flavoured as for a trifle, or in any 
other way to. the taste. 

POMMES AU bevrre; (buttered apples. Excellent.) 

Pare six or eight fine apples of a firm kind, but of a ?ood cooking 
sort, and core without piercing them through, or dividing mem l fill the 
cavities with fresh butter, put a quarter-pound more cut small into a 



CHAP. XX.3 BWKET DISHES. 927 

stewpan jast large enoagh to contain the apples in r single layer, place 
them closely together on it, and stew them as softly as possible^ turning 
them occasionafly until they are almost sufficiently tender to serve ; then 
strew upon them as much sifted sugar as will sweeten the dish highly, 
and a teaspoon ful of pounded cinnamon ; shake these well in and upon 
the fruit, and stew it for a few minutes longer. Lift it out, arrange it 
in a hot dish, put into each apple as much warm apricot jam as it will 
contain, and lay a small quantity on the top ; pour the syrup from the 
pan round, but not on the fruit, and serve it immediately. 

Apples, 6 to 8 ; fresh butter, 4 ozs., just simmered till tender. Sugar, 
6 to 8 ozs. ; cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful : 5 minutes. Apricot ja(& as 
needed. 

Obs, — Particular care must be taken to keep the apples entire; they 
should rather steam in a gentle heat than boil. It is impossible to 
specify the precise time which will render them sufficiently tender, as 
this must depend greatly on the time of year and the sort of fruit If 
the stewpan were placed in a very slow oven, the more regular heat of 
it would perhaps be better in its effect than the stewing. 

8VEDOI8E OF PEACHES. 

Pare and divide four fine, ripe peaches, and let them just simmer 
from five to eight minutes in a syrup made with the third of a pint of 
water and three ounces of very white sugar, boiled together for fifteen 
minutes ; lift them out carefully into a deep dish, and pour about half 
the syrup over them, and into the remaining half throw a couple of 
pounds more of quite ripe peaches, and boil them to a perfectly smooth, 
dry pulp, or marmalade, with as much additional sugar, in fine powder, 
as the nature of the fruit may require. Lift the other peaches from the 
i^rup, and reduce it by very quick boiling more than half. Spread a 
deep layer of the marmalade in a dish, arrange the peaches symmetri- 
cally round it, and fill all the spaces between them with the marma- 
lade ; place the half of a blanched peach-kernel in each,* pour the re- 
duced syrup equally over the surface, and border the dish with Italian 
macaroons, or, in lieu of these, witli candied citron, sliced very thin, 
and cut into leaves with a small paste-cutter. A little lemon-juice 
brings out the flavour of all preparations of peaches, and may be added 
with good effect to this. When the fruit is scarce, the marmalade 
(which ought to be very white) may be made in part or entirely with 
nonsuches. The better to preserve their form, the peaches are some- 
times merely wiped, and then boiled tolerably tender in the syrup before 
they are pared or split. Half a pint of water, and from five to six 
ounces of sugar must then be allowed for them. If any of those used 
^r the marmalade should not be quite ripe, it will be better to pass it 
through a sieve, when partially done, to prevent its being lumpy. 

Large ripe peaches, pared and halved, 4 ; simmered in syrup, 5 to S 
minutes. Marmalade : peaches (or nonsuches), 2 lbs. ; sugar, ^ to j 
lb. : } to 1 hour, and more : strained lemon-juice, 1 tablespoonful. Cit 
ron» or macaroons, as needed. 

Peaches, if boiled whole in syrup, 15 to 18 minutes. 

Obs. — The number of peaches can, at pleasure, be increased to six 
and three or four of the halves can be piled above the others in the cen* 
tre of the dish.

ABOCK DOCB (OB BWErr RICK. A LA FORTDOAIBB) 

Wipe thoroug^hly, in a dry soft cloth, half a pound of the best Caro- 
lina rice, after it has been carefuUy picked; put to it three pints of new 
milk, and when it has stewed gently for half an hour, add eight ounces 
of sugar, broken into small lumps; let it boil until it is dry and tender, 
and when it is nearly so, stir to it two ounces of blanched and pounded 
almond& Turn the rice, when done, into shallow dishes, or soup-plate^ 
and shake it until the surface is smooth ; then sift over it, rather thickly, 
through a muslin, some freshly-powdered cinnamon, which will give it 
the appearance of a baked pudding. Serve it cold. It will remain 
good for several days. This is quite the best sweet preparation of rice 
that we have ever eaten, and it is a very fiivourite dish in Portugal, 
whence the receipt was derived. One or two bitter almonds, pounded 
with th« sweet ones, might a little improve its flavour, and a few spoons- 
ful of rich cream could occasionally be substituted for a small portion of 
the milk, but it should not be added until the preparation is three 
parts done. 

Rice, 8 ozs. ; milk, 8 pints : 30 minutes. Sugar, 8 ozs« : 1 hour, or 
more. Pounded almonds, 2 ozs. ; cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful. 

Obs. — ^The rice must be frequently stirred while boiling, particularly 
after it begins to thicken ; and it will be better not to add the entire 
quantity of milk at first, as from a quarter to half a pint less will some- 
times prove sufficient The grain 8lK}uld be thoroughly tender, but dry 
and unbroken. 

BERMUDA WITCHES. 

Slice equally some rice, pound, or sponge cake, not more than the 
sixth of an inch thick; take off the brown edges, and spread one half of 
it with Guava jelly, or, if more convenient, with fine strawberry, rasp- 
berry, or currant jelly of good quality (see Norman receipt, 338) ; on this 
strew thickly some fresh cocoanut grated small, and lightly ; press over 
it the remainder of the cake, and trim the whole into good form; divide 
the slices if larsfe, pile them slopingly in the centre of a dish upon a 
very white napkin folded flat, and garnish or intersperse them with 
small sprigs of myrtle. For very young people a French roll or two, 
and ^^ood currant jelly, red or white, will supply a wholesome and inex- 
pensive dish.

PRESERVES. 



Fruit for preserviDg should slwaye be gathered ia perlectlj dry 
weathftr ; it should aleo be free both from the morninw and evening dew, 
and as much so as possible from dust. When bottled, it miiBt be 
Bteamed or baked during the da; on which it is gathered, or there will 
be great loss from the butEting of the bottles ; and for jama and jelliea it 
cannot be tiM soon boiled down after it is taken from tlie traea. 

The small portable French stove, or furnnce,* ahown above, with the 
trevet and stewpaa adapted to it, is ezceedmgly convenient for all pre- 
p^ntiooB which require either more than usual attention, or a fira 
entirely free from smoke ; ai it can be placed on a table in a clear 
Jiffht, and the heat can be regulated at pleasure. It has been used for 
all the preserves, of which the receipts are given in this chapter, aa 
well ae for various dishes contained in the body of the work. There 
ahould always be a free current of air in the room in which it sUnda 
when lighted, as charcoal or braise (that is to ray, the little embers of 
large well-burned wood, drawn from an oven, and shut immediately 
into a cloeely-Btopped iron or copper vessel to extinguish Ihem) is the 
only fuel suited to it To kindle either of these, two or three bits must 
be lighted in a common fire, and laid on the top of that in the furnace, 
which should be evenly placed between the grating and the brim, t,ai 
then blown gently with the bellows until the whole ia alight: the door

of the furnace must in the meanwhile be open, and remain eo, unleaa 
ibe heat should at any lime be loo fierce for toe preeerrea, whun it muet 
be doaed fbc a few minutes, to moderate it. To extinguiah the fiie 




c 



altogether, the cover must be pregsed closely on, and the dr>or be quite 
ehut: the embera which remain will serve to rekindle it easilj, but 
before it is again lighted the grating must be lifted out and all the ssliea 
cleared away. It should be set by in a place which is not damp. 

The German enamelled stewpans, now coming Into general us?, are, 
from the peculiar nicety of the composition with which they are lined, 
better adapted than any others to pickling and preserving, as they may 
be used without danger for acids; and red fruits, when toiled in them, 
retain the brightness of their colour as well as if capper or bell-metal 
were naed for them. The form of the old-fashioned preservin^pan, 
made usually of one or the other of these, is shown above ; but it has 
not, wo should say, even the advantage of being of convenient shape; 
for the handles quickly become heatS, and the pan, in consequence, 
cannot always be instantaneously raised from the fire when the contenta 
threaten to over-boil, or to burn. 

It is desirable to have three or four wooden spoons or spatulas, on* 
fine hair-eieve, at the least, one or two large squares of comnton mus- 
lin, and a Btra.iner, or more of closer texture, kept exclusively fw pre- 
paralionH of fhiit, for if used for other purposes, there is the hazard, 
without great care, of their retaining some strong or coarse flavoar, 
which they wouJd impart to the preserves. A sieve, for exampie, 
through which any preparation of onions has been poured, should never, 
OR nnv account, be brought into use for any kind of confectionary, nor 
in making' sweet dishca, nor for straining eggs or milk for puddings, 
cakes, or bread. Damp is the great enemy, iiot only of preserves aod 
pickles, but of numberless other household stores; yet, in many ratua- 
tions, it is extremely difficult to exclude it. To keep them in a " dry 
cool place" (words which occur so frequently lioth in this book, and in 
most others on the same subject), is more easily directed than done. 
They't-emain, we find, more entirely free from any danger of moulding', 
when covered with a hrandied paper only, and placed on the shelve* of 
a tolerably dry store-room; hut they are rather liable to candy when 
thus kept, and we fency that the flavour of the fruit is somewhat lesi 
perfectly preserved than when they are quite secured fnun the air by

dkioB stretched over the jars. If left uncovered, the inroads of mice 
upon them must be guarded against, as they will commit great havoc 
in a single night on these sweet stores. When the slightest fermenta- 
tion is perceptible in synip, it should immediately be boiled for some 
minutes, and well skimmed; the fruit taken from it should then be 
thrown in, and well scalded also, and the whole, when done, should be 
turned into a very clean dry jar : this kind of preserve should always 
be covered with one or two skins, or with parchment and thick paper. 

A FEW GENERAL RULES AND DIRECTIONS FOR PRESERVING. 

1. Let every thing used for the purpose be delicately clean and drt/i 
bottles especially so. 

2. Never place a preserving-pan Jlat upon the Jtre^ as this will ren- 
der the preserve liable to burn to, as it is called ; that is to say, to ad- 
here closely to the metal, and then to burn ; it should rest always on a 
trevet, or on the lowered bar of the kitchen range. 

3. After the sugar is added to them, stir the preserves gently at first, 
and more quickly towards the end, without quitting them until they are 
done ; this precaution will always prevent the chance of their being 

^spoiled. 

4. All preserves should be perfectly cleared from the scum as it 
rises. 

5. Fruit which is to be preserved in syrup must first be blanched or 
boiled gently, until it is sufficiently sdlened to absorb the sugar; and a 
thin syrup must be poured on it at first, or it will drivel instead of re- 
maining plump, and becoming clear. Thus, if its weight of sugar is to 
be allowed, and boiled to a syrup with a pint of water to the pound, onlr 
half the weight must be taken at first, and this must not be boiled with 
the water more than fifteen or twenty minutes at the commencement 
of the process; a part of the remaining sugar must be added every 
time the syrup ia reboiled, unless it should be otherwise directed in the 
receipt 

6. To preserve both the true favour and the colour of fruit in janw 
and jellies, boil them rapidly until they are well reduced, before the 
sugar is added, and quickly afterwards, but do not allow them to be- 

^ come so much thickened that the sugar will not dissolve in them easily, 
and throw up its scum. In some seasons, the juice is so much richer 
than in others, that this effect takes place almost before one is aware of 
it; but the drop which adheres to the skimmer, when it is held up, will 
show the state it has reached. 

7. Never use tin, iron, or pewter spoons, or skimmers for preserves, 
as they will convert the colour of red iVuit into a dingy purple, and im- 
part, besides, a very unpleasant flavour. 

8. When cheap jams or jellies are required, make them at once 
with loaf^ugar, but use that which is well refined always, for pre- 
serves in general ; it is a false economy, as we have elsewhere observ- 
ed, to purchase an inferior kind, as there is great waste from it in the 

auantity of scum which it throws up, The best has been used for all 
lie receipts given here. 

TO EXTRACT THE JUICE OF PLUMS FOR JELLT.

fectly sound ; put it into very clean, large stonfe jars, and give part of 
the harder kinds, such as bullaces and damsons, a gash wiSi a knife as 
they are thrown in ; do this especially in filling the upper part of the 
jars. Tie one or two folds of thick paper over them, and set them far 
the night into an oven from which the bread has been drawn four or 
five hours; or cover them with bladder, instead of paper, place them 
in deep pans of water, and boil them gently from two to three hours, or 
until the &uit is quite soft, and has yielded all the juice it will affi>rd : 
this last is the safer and better mode for jellies of delicate colour. 

TO WEIGH THE JUICE OF FRUIT. 

Put a basin into one scale, and its weight into the other ; add to this 
last the weight which is required of the juice» and pour into the basin 
as much as will balance the scales. It is always better to weigh than 
to measure the juice lor preserving, as it can generally be done with 
more exactness. 

OEEBN GOOSEBERRY JELLT. 

Wash some freshly-gathered gooseberries very clean, after having 
taken off the tops and stalks, then to each pound, pour three-quarters of 
a pint of spring water, and simmer them until they are well broken ; 
turn tlie whole into a jelly-bag or cloth, and let all the juice drain 
through ; weigh, and boil it rapidly for fifteen minute& Draw it from 
the fire, and stir into it until entirely dissolved an equal weight of good 
sugar reduced to powder ; boil the jelly from fifteen to twenty minutes 
longer, or until it jellies strongly on the spoon or skimmer; clear it 
perfectly from scum, and pour it into small jars, moulds, or glasses. It 
ought to be very pale and transparent Preserved fruits just dipped into 
hot water to take off the syrup, then well drained and dried, may be 
arranged with good effect in the centre of the gooseberry jelly if the 
glasses be rather less than half filled before they are laid in, and the 
jelly just set : the remainder must be kept liquid to fill them up. The 
sugar may be added to the juice at first, and the preserve boiled from 
twenty-five to thirty-five minutes, but the colour will not then be so 
good. When the fruit abounds the juice may be drawn from it with 
very little water, as directed for apples, page 350, when it will require 
much less boiling. 

Gooseberries, 6 lbs. ; water, 4 pints : 20 to 30 minutes. Juice boiled 
quickly, 15 minutes ; to each pound, 1 lb. sugar : 15 to 20 minutes. 

GREEN GOosEBERRT-JAM ; (Jifm and of good colour,) 

Cut the stalks and tops from the fruit, weig^h and bruise it slightly^ 
boil it for six or seven minutes, keeping it well turned during the time ; 
then to every three pounds of gooseberries add two and a half of sugar, 
beaten to powder, and boil the preserve quickly for three-quarters of an 
hour. It must be constantly stirred, and carefiilly cleared from scuol 

Green gooseberries, 6 lbs. : 6 to 7 minutes. Sugar, 5 lbs. : J hour. 

TO DRY GREEN GOOSEBERRIES. 

Take the finest green gooseberries, fully grown, and freshly gathered ; 
cut ofi'the buds, split them across the tops halfway down, and with the 
small end of a tea or of an egg-spoon, scoop out the seeds. Boil toge- 
tlier for fifteen minutes a pound and a half of the finest sugar, and a 
pint of water; skim this syrup thoroughly and throw into it a pound of

the seeded gooseberries ; simmer them from five to seven minutes, when 
they ought to be clear and tender ; wJ)en they are so lid them out, and 
throw as many more into the syrup ; drain them a little when done, 
spread them singly on dishes, and dry them very gradually in a quite 
cool stove or oven, or in a sunny window. They will keep well in the 
syrup, and may be potted in it, and dried when wanted for use. 

Green ^rooseberries without the seeds, 2 lbs. ; water, 1 pint; sugar, 
1 J lb. : boiled 15 minutes. Gooseberries simmered, 5 to 7 minutes. 

OKBEN OOOSEBBRRIES lOK TARTS. 

Fill very clean, dry, wide-necked bottles with gooseberries gathered 
the same day, and before they have attained their full growth. Cork 
them lightly, wrap a littlo hay round each of them, and set them up to 
their necks in a copper of cold water, which should be brought very 
gradually to boil. Let the fruit be gently simmered until it appears 
shrunken and perfectly scalded ; then take out the bottles, and with the 
contents of one or two fill up the remainder, and use great care not to 
break the fruit in doing this. When all are ready, pour tf<;a/(ft7i^ 
water into the bottles and cover the gooseberries entirely with it, or 
they will become mouldy at the top. Cork the bottles well imme- 
diately, and cover the necks with melted rosin ; keep them in a cool 
place ; and when they are used pour off the greater part of the water, 
and add sugar as for the fresh fruit, of which they will have quite the 
flavour and appearance ; and they will be found much more wholesome 
prepared in this manner than if simply baked or steamed in the bottles. 

COtEEN GOOSEBBRRT SOLID. 

Bruise well, and boil six pounds of fresh green gooseberries for an 
hour and a quarter without sugar, and fbr half an hour afler having 
stirred to them a couple of pounds of good quality, reduced quite to 
powder. Press the preserve into shallow pans or small shapes, and 
unmould it when it is wanted fbr table. 

Green gooseberries, 6 lbs. : 1| hour. Sugar, 2 lbs. : J hour. 

RED GOOSEBERRY JAM. 

The small rough red gooseberry, when fully ripe, is the best for this^ 
preserve, which may, however, be made of the larger kinds. When 
the buds and stalks nave been taken carefully from the fruit, weigh, and 
boil it quickly 9x three quarters of an hour, keeping it well stirred ; 
ihsR fbr six pounds of the gooseberries add two ana a half of good 
roughly-powdered sugar (or Siree of fine Lisbon, if only a common pre» 
serve be wanted) ; boil these together briskly, from twenty to twenty- 
five minutes, and stir the jam well from the bottom of the pan, as it in 
liable to bum if this be neglected.

CHERRY JAM. 

First stone, and then weigh some freshly gathered preserving cher- 
ries; boil them over a brisk fire for an hour, keeping them almost 
constantly stirred from the bottom of the pan, to which &ey will other- 
wise be liable to stick and burn. Add half a pound of good sugar roughly 
powdered for each pound of the fruit, and boil the preserve quickly for 
twenty minutes, taking off the scum as it rises. The blanched kernels 
of part of the cherries may be added to the jam five minutes before it is 
taken from the fire. We can recommend this receipt as producing a 
firm preserve of fine colour and flavour, and veij far superior to any 
that can be made by the more common method of boiling the fruit and 
Bum together from the beginning. 
Stoned, cherries, 6 lbs. : 1 hour. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 20 minutea 
Obs. — Increase the proportion of sugar, when it is liked, to twelve or 
sixteen ounces, and diminish the boiling a quarter of an hour before it 
is added, and ten minutes after. We have found almost invariably, that 
preserve^ made by the receipts we have given have been preferred to 
richer ones. 

TO DRY CHERRIES WITH SUGAR ; (a quick ofid tosy method,) 

Stone some fine, sound cherries; weigh and put them into a pre- 
serving-pan, with six ounces of sugar reduced to powder to each pound 
of the fruit: set them over a moderate fire, and simmer them gently for 
nearly or quite twenty minutes ; let them remain in the syrup until 
they are a little cooled, then turn them into a sieve, and before they 
are cold lay them singly on dishes, and dry them very gradually, as 
directed for other fruits. When the cherries are quite ripe the stones 
may generally be drawn out with the stalks, by pressing the fruit gently 
at the same time ; but when this method fkils, they must be extracted 
with a new quill, cut round at the end ; those of the very shortp^talked, 
turnip-shaped cherry, which abounds, and is remarkably fine in many 
* parts of Normandy, and. which we have occasionally met with here, 
though it is not, we believe, very abundant in our markets, are easily 
removed with a large pin, on the point of which the stone may be cauglk 
at the stalk end, just opposite the seam of the fruit, and drawn out at 
the top, leaving the cherry apparently entire. 

DRIED CHERRIES ; (jsuperioT Receipt,) 

To each pound of cherries, weighed after they are stoned, add eight 
ounces of good sugar, and boil them very softly for ten minutes ; pour 
them into a large bowl, or pan, and leave them two days in the syrup ; 
then simmer them again for ten minutes, and set them by for two or 
three days; drain them slightly, and dry them very slowly, as directed 
in the previous receipts. Keep them in tin cases, or canisters, when 
done. These cherries are generally preferred to such as are dried with 
a larger proportion of su^r; but when the taste is in favour of the lat- 
ter, three quarters or a mil pound can be allowed to the pound of fruit, 
which may then be potted in the syrup and dried at any time, though 
we think the flavour of the cherries is better preserved when this is 
done within a fortnight of their being boiled. 

Cherries, stoned, 8 lbs.; sugar, 4 lbs.: 10 minutes. Left 2 or 8 
days. Boiled again, 10 minutes ; left 2 days ; drained and dried.

CHERRIES DRIED WITROITT SUGAR. 

These are often more pleasant and refreshing to invalids and travel- 
lers than a sweetened confection of the fruit, their flavour and agreea- 
ble acidity being well preserved when they are simply spread on dishes 
or hamper lids, and slowly driiad.* Throw aside the bruised and de- 
cayed ^uit, and arrange the remainder singly, and with the stalks up- 
permost on the dishes. 

MORELLA CHERRIES. 

Take off the stalks but do not stone the fruit ; weigh and add to it an 
equal quantity of the. best sugar reduced quite to powder, strew it over 
the chenries and let them stand for half an hour, then turn them gently 
into a preserving-pan, and simmer them softly from five to seven mi- 
nutes. 

COMMON CHERRY CHEESE. 

Stone the fruit, or if this trouble be objected to, bruise and boil it 
without, until it is sufficiently tender to press through a sieve, which it 
will be in from twenty to thirty minutes. Weigh the pulp in this case, 
and boil it quickly to a dry paste, then stir to it six ounces of sugar for 
the pound of fruit, and when this is dissolved, place the pan again 
over, but not upon, a brisk fire, and stir the preserve without ceasing, 
until it is so dry as not to adhere to the finger when touched ; then 
press it immediately into small moulds or pans, and turn it from them 
when wanted for table. When the cherries have been stoned, a good 
common preserve may be made of them without passing them throiig'h 
a sieve, with the addition of five ounces of sugar to the pound of fruit, 
which must be boiled very dry both before and after it is added. 
• Other cherries without stoning : 20 to 30 minutes. Passed through 
a sieve. To each pound of pulp (first boiled dry), 6 ozs. sugar. To 
each pound of cherries stoned and boiled to dry paste, 5 ozs. sugar. 

CHERRY PASTE. (FRENCH.) 

Stone the cherries, boil them gently in their own juice for thirty 
minutes ; press the whole through a sieve ; reduce it to a very dry 
paste ; then take it from the fire, and weigh it ; boil an equal propor- 
tion of sugar to the candying point, mix the fruit with it, and stir the 
paste, without intermission, over a moderate fire, until it is again so dry 
as to ferm a ball round the spoon, and to quit the preserving-pan en- 
tirely ; press it quickly into small moulds, and when it is cold, paper, 
and store it like other preserves. 

STRAWBERRY JAM. 

Strip the stalks from some fine scarlet strawberries, weigh, and boil 
them for thirty-five minutes, keeping them very constantly stirred; 
throw in eight ounces of good sugar, beaten small, to the pound of 
fruit, mix them well off the fire, then boil the preserve again quickly 
for twenty-five minutes. One pound of white currant^juice added in 
the firet instance to four of the strawberries, will greatly improve this 
preserve, which will be quite firm, and sufficiently, but not over sweet

fitantly stirred, but neither should in any- case be neglected. 

STRAWBERRY JELLT. 

This, when made with fine, full-flavoured, scarlet strawberries, is a 
very delicious preserve, and is by many persons preferred to guava 
jelly, which it greatly resembles. Stalk the fruit, bruise it very 
slightly, and stir it for a few minutes over a gentle fire ; strain it with- 
out pressure, weigh, and boil it quickly for twenty minutes in a Ger- 
man enamelled stewpan, or preserving-pan, if possible, that the colour 
may not be injured ; take it from the fire, and stir into it twelve ounces 
of sugar to the pound of juice ; when this is dissolved, boil it again 
quickly for twenty minutes, clear it perfectly firom scum, and pour it 
intjo jars or glasses. The preserve will be firmer, and require less boil- 
ing, if one-fourth of red or white currant juice be mixed with that of 
the strawberries, but the flavour will not then be quite so perfect A 
superior jelly to this is made by taking an equal weight of juice and 
sugar, and by boiling the latter to candy-height, before the juice (whicb 
should previously be boiled five minutes) is added to it ; and when ther 
have been stirred together off the fire until this is entirely dissolvea* 
boiling the whole quickly from ten to twenty minutes; the time re- 
quired varying very much from the diflbrence which is found in the 
quality of the fruit.

ANOTHER YERT FINE STRAWBERRY JELLY. 

Express the juice from the finiit through a cloth, strain it clear, weigh, 
and stir to it an equal proportion of the finest sugar, dried and reduced 
to powder ; when this is dissolved, place the preserving-pan over a very 
clear fire, and stir the jelly often until it boils ; clear it carefully fi:Qm

TO PRE8ERYE STRAWBERRIES OR RASPBERRIES, FOR CREAMS OR ICES, 

WITHOCT BOIUNU. 

Let the fruit be gathered in the middle of a warm day, in very dry 
weather; strip it from the stalks directly, weigh it, turn it into a bowl 
or deep pan, and bruise it gently ; mix with an equal weight of fine ciry 
sifted sugar, and put it immediatelv into small, wide-necked bottles; 
cork these firmly without delay, and tie bladder over the tops. Keep 
them in a cool place, or the fruit will ferment The mixture should be 
stirred softly, and only just sufficiently to blend the sugar and the frbit. 
The bottles must be perfectly dry, and the bladders, after having been 
cleaned in the usual way, and allowed to become nearly so, should be 
moistened with a little spirit on the side which is to be next to the cork.

RASPBERRY JAM. 

Bruise gently, with the back of a wooden spoon, six pounds of ripe 
and freshly-gathered raspberries, and boil them over a brisk fire for 
twenty-five minutes ; stir to them half their weight of good sugar, 
roughly powdered, and when it is dissolved, boil the preserve quickly 
fer ten minutes, keeping it well stirred and skimmed. When a richer 
iam is wished for, add to the fruit at first its full weight of sugar, and 
boil them together twenty minutes. 

Raspberries, 6 lbs. : 25 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 10 minutes. 

GOOD RED OR WHTFE RASPBERRY JAM. 

Boil quickly, for twenty minutes, four pounds of either red or white 
sound ripe raspberries in a pound and a half of currant-juiee of the 
same colour ; take the pan from the fire, stir in three pounds of sugar, 
and when it is dissolved, place the pan again over the fire, and con- 
tinue the boiling ibr ten minutes longer : keep the preserve well skhn- 
med and stirred from the beginning.

RASPBERRY JELLY POR FLAVOURINO CREAMS. 

Take the stalks from some quite ripe, and freshly-gathered raspber- 
ries, stir them over the fire until they render their juice fireely, then 
strain and weigh it; or press it fi'om them throngh a cloth, and then 
strain it clear ; in either case boil it for five minutes after it is weighed, 
and for each pound stir in a pound and a quarter of good sugar, reduced 
quite to powder, sifted, and made very hot; boil the preserve quicklv 
for five minutes longer, and skim it clean. The jelly thus made will 
sufficiently sweeten the creams without any additional sugar. 

Juice of raspberries, 4 lbs. : 5 minutes. Sugar, made hot, 5 lbs. : 5

ANOTHER RASPBERRRY JELLY. ( Very gOOd.) 

Bruise the fruit a little^ and draw the juice from it by four or five 
minutes gently simmering; strain and weigh it, boil it quickly for 
twenty minutes, draw it from the fire, add three-quarters of a pound of 
good su^ar for each pound of juice, and when this is dissolved, place the 
pan agam on the fire, and boil the preserve f<ist from twelve to fifteen 
minutes longer; skim it thoroughly, and keep it well stirred. This 
jelly is infinitely improved in colour and in firmness, though not per- 
haps in flavour, by mixing with the raspberry juice one-fourth, or even 
as much as a thira of the juice of ripe white currants : the preserve will 
then require rather less boiling. When it jellies in fiilling from the 
spoon or skimmer, it is done. Nothing of tin or iron should be used in 
making it, as these metals will convert its fine red colour into a dingy 
purple.

OBBBN CURRANT JAM. 

For each pound of currants take fourteen ounces of good sugar, in 
fine powder ; bruise part of the fruit with a small portion of the sugar, 
and put it first into the preserving-pan, that the juice may fiow from it 
sufficiently to prevent the remainder from being burned; it should be 
placed over a very gentle fire, and stirred constantly until it has yielded 
moisture enough for this. All the fruit and sugar may then be added, 
and the whole (well mixed and stirred) boiled from ten to fifteen mi- 
nutes, or until it jellies strongly in falling from the skimmer. Some 
fruit will require less time, and some rather more. 

To each pound of currants, stripped from stalks, 14 ozs. of sugar: 10 
to Id minutes. 

RED CURRAMT JELLT. 

With three parts of fine ripe red currants freshly gathered, and 
stripped from the stalks, mix one of white currants ; put them into a 
clean preserving-pan, and stir them gently over a clear fire until the 
juice flows from them freely ; then turn them into a fine hair-sieve, and ' 
let tiiem drain well, but without pressure. Pass the juice through a 
folded muslin, or a jelly-bag; weigh it, and then boil it fast for a quar- 
ter of an hour ; add for each pound, eight ounces of sugar coarsely pow- 
dered, stir this to it ofiT the fire until it is dissolved, give the jelly eight 
minutes more of quick boiling, and pour it out. It will be firm, and of 
excellent colour and flavour. Be sure to clear off the scum as it rises 
both before and after the sugar is put in, or the preserve will not be 
clear. 

Juice of red currants, 3 lbs. ; juice of white currants, 1 lb. : 15 mi-

SUPERLATIVE RED ciniRANT JEixT ; (Norman Receipt,) 

Strip carefully from the stems some quite-ripe currants of the finest 
quality, and mix with them an equal weight of good sugar reduced to 
powder; boil these together quickly for exactly eight minutes, keep 
them stirred all the time, and clear off the scum as it rises ; then turn 
the preserve into a very clean sieve, and put into small jars the jelly 
which runs through it, and which will be delicious in flavour, and of 
the brightest colour. It should be carried immediately, when this is 
practicable, to an extremely cool but not a damp place, and left there 
tifl perfectly cold. The currants which remain in the sieve make an 
excellent jam, particularly if only part of the jelly be taken from them,

DELICIOUS RED CVRRAIfT JAM. 

This, which is but an indifferent preserve when made in the usual 
way, will be ibund a very fine one if the following directions for it be 
observed ; it will be extremely transparent and bright in colour, and 
will retain perfectly the flavour of the fruit Take the currants at the 
height of their season, the finest that can be had, free from dust, but 
gathered on a dry day ; strip them with great cafe from the stalks, 
weigh and put them into a preserving-pan with three pounds of the best 
sugar reduced to -powder to four pounds of the fruit ; stir them gently 
over a brisk clear fire, and boil them quickly for exactly eight minute9 
from the first full boil. As the jam is apt to rise over the top of the 
pan, it is better not to fill it more than two thirds, and if this precaution 
should not be sufficient to prevent it, it must be lifted from tiie fire and 
held away for an instant. To many tastes, a still finer jam than this 
(which we find sufficiently sweet) may be made with an equal weight 
of fruit and sugar boiled together for seven minutes. There should be 
great exactness with respect to the time, as both the flavour and the 
brilliant colour of the preserve will be injured by longer boiling.

TERT FINE WHITE CURRANT JELLY. 

The fi*uit for this jelly should be very white, perfectly free from dust,

ounces of double refined sifted sugar, and boil tliem together quickly for 
six minutes ; throw in the strained juice of a sound fresh lemon, or of 
two, should the quantity of preserve be large; boil it two minutes 
longer ; pour it into a delicately clean sieve, and finish it by the direc- 
tions given for the Norman red currant jelly (page 1^38).

BLACK CURRANT JBLLT. ^ 

After having extracted the juice of the fruit in the usual way, pro- 
ceed exactly with regard to the time of boiling, and the proportion o£ 
Bugir as in the first receipt for red currant jelly in the present chapter. 
This is a most refreshing and useful preserve m illness; and in many 
cases no other will supply its place : it may be made with Lisbon sugar 
on occasion. 

miRSERT PRESERVE. 

Take the stones from a couple of pounds of cherries, and boil them 
twenty minutes ; then add to them a pound and a half of raspberries, 
and an equal quantity of red and of white currants, all weighed after 
they have been cleared from their stems. Boil these together briskly 
for twenty minutes; mix with them (hree pounds and a quarter of com- 
mon sugar, and give the preserve fifteen minutes more of quick boiling. 
A pound and a half of blackberries may be substituted for the cherries ; 
but they will not require any stewing before they are added to the other 
fruits. The jam must be well stirred from the beginning, or it will bum 
to the pan. 

Cherries, 2 lbs. : 20 minute& Raspberries, red currants, and white 
currants, of each IJ lb. : 20 minutes. Sugar, 3^ lbs. : 15 minutes. 

ANOTHER OOOD COMMON PRESERVE. 

Boil together, in equal or in unequal portions (for this is immaterial), 
any kinds (Nearly fruit, till they can be pressed through a sieve; weigh, 
and then boil the pulp o^t a brisk fire for half an hour ; add half a 
pound of sugar for each pound of fruit, and again boil the preserve 
quickly, keeping it well stirred and skimmed, from fifteen to twenty 
minutes. Cherries, unless they be morel las, must be first stewed ten- 
der apart, as they will require a much longer time to make them so 
than other of the first summer fruit& 

A GOOD MELANGE, OR MIXED PRESERVE. 

Boil for three quarters of an hour, in two pounds of clear red currant 
juice, one pound of very ripe greengages, weighed afler they have been 
pared and stoned ; then stir to them one pound and a half of good sugar, 
and boil them quickly again for twenty minutes. If the quantity of pre- 
serve be much increas^, the time of boiling it must be so likewise: 
this is always better done before the sugar is added.

GKEENQAOE JAM, OR MARMALADE. 

When the plums are thoroughly ripe, take off the skins, weigh, and 
boil them quickly without sugar for fifty minutes, keeping them well 
stirred ; then to every four pounds add three of good sugar reduced 
quite to powder, boil the preserve from five to eight minutes longer, and 
clear off the scum perfectly before it is poured into the jars. When the 
fiesh of the fruit will not separate easily from the stones, weigh and 
throw the plums whole into the preserving-pan, boil them to a pulp, 
pass them through a sieve, and deduct the weight of the stones from 
them when apportioning the sugar to the janK The Orleans plum may 
be substituted for greengages, in this receipt 

Greengages, stoned and skinned, 6 lbs. : 50 minutes. Sugar, 4^ lbs. ; 
5 to 8 minutes. 

PRESERVE OF THE MAGNUM BONUM, OR M0OT7L PLUM. 

Prepare, weigh, and boil the plums for forty minutes ; stir to them 
half their weight of good sugar beaten fine, and when it is dissolved 
continue the boiling for ten additional minutes, and skim the preserve 
carefully during the time. This is an excellent marmalade, but it may 
be rendered richer by increasing the proportion of sugar. Thfe blanched 
kernels of a portion of the fruit-stones will much improve its flavour, 
but they should be mixed with it only two or three minutes before it is 
taken from the fire. When these plums are not entirely ripe, it is diffi- 
cult to free them from the stones and skins: they should then be boiled 
down and pressed through a sieve, as directed for greengages, in the 
receipt above. 

Mogul plums, skinned and stoned, 6 lbs : 40 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 
5 to 8 minutes. 

TO DRY OR PRESERVE MOGUL PLUMS IN SYRUP. 

Pare the plums, but do not remove the stalks nor stones ; take their 
weight of dry sifted sugar, lay them in a deep dish or bowl, and strew 
it over them ; let them remain thus for a night, then pour them gently 
into a preserving-pan, with all the sugar, heat them slowly, and let 
them just simmer for five minutes ; in a couple of days repeat the pro- 
cess, and do so again and again at an interval of two or three days, until 
the firuit is tender and very clear ; put it then into jars, and keep it in 
the syrup, or drain and dry the plums very gradually, as directed for 
other fruit. When they are not sufficiently ripe for the skin to part 
from them easily, they must be covered with spring water, placed over 
a slow fire, and just scalded until it can be stripped off easily. 

MUSSEL PLUM CHEESE AND JELLY. 

Fill large stone jars with the fruit, which should be ripe, dry, and 
sound, set them into an oven from which the bread has been drawn 
several hours, and let them remain all night; or, if this cannot conve- 
niently be done, place them in pans of water, and boil them gently until 
the plums are tender, and have yielded their juice to the utmost Pour 
this from them, strain it through a jelly-bag, weigh, and then boil it 
rapidly for twenty-five minutes. Have ready, broken small, Uireo

iolved, and then continue the ooiJing quickly for ten minutes longer, 
and be careful to remove all the scum. Pour the preserve into small 
moulds or pans, and turn it out when it is wanted for table ; it will be 
▼ery fine, both in colour and in flavour.

The cheese. — Skin and stone the plums from which the juice has 
been poured, and after having weighed, boil them an hour and a quarter 
over a brisk fire, and stir uem constantly; then to three pounds of 
fruit add one of sugar, beaten to powder; boil the preserve for another 
half hour, and press it into shallow pans or moulds. 

Plums, 3 lbs. : 1^ hour. Sugar, 1 lb. : 30 minutes. 

TO DRY apricots; (fl qutck and easy f^ethod,) 

Wipe gently, split, and stone some fine apricots, which are not over- 
ripe ; weigh, and arrange them evenly in a deep dish or bowl, and 
strew in fourteen ounces of sugar, in fine powder, to each pound of 
fruit ; on the following day turn the whole carefully into a preserving- 
pan, let the apricots heat slowly, and simmer them very softly for six 
minutes, or for an instant longer, should they not in that time be quite 
tender. Let them lay in the syrup for a day or two, then drain and 
spread thqpi singly on dishes to dry. 

To each pound apricots, 14 ozs. of sugar: to stand 1 night, to be sim- 
mered from 6 to 8 minutes, and lefl in syrup 2 or 3 days. 

PEAOH JAM, OR MARMALADS. 

The fruit for this preserve, which is a veiy delicious one, should be 
finely flavoured, and quite ripe, though perrectly sound. Pare, stone, 
weigh, and boil it quickly for three quarters of an hour, and do not fail 
to stir it often during the time ; draw it from the fire, and mix with it 
ten ounces of well-refined sugar, rolled or beaten to powder, for each 
pound of the peaches ; clear it carefully from scum, and boil it briskly 
for five minutes ; throw in the strained juice of one or two good lemons ; 
continue the boiling for three minutes only, and pour out the manna- 
lade. Two minutes after the sugar is stirred to the fruit, add the 
blanched kernels of part of the peaches. 

Peaches, stoned and pared, 4 lbs. : | hour. Sugar, 2^ lbs. : 2 min- 
utes. Blanched peach-kernels: 3 minutes. Juice of 2 smoZ/ lemons: 
3 minutes. / 

Obs. — ^yhis jam, like most others, is improved by pressing the fruit 
through a sieve after it has been partially boiled. Nothing can be finer 
than its flavour, which would be injured by adding the sugar at first ; 
and a larger proportion renders it cloyingly sweet. Nectarines and 
peaches mixed, make an admirable preserve. 

lO PRESERVE, OR TO DRV PEACHES OR NECTARINES. {An COSy and 

excellent Receipt.) 

The fruit should be fine, freshly gathered, and fuUy ripe, but still in 
Its perfection. Pare, halve, and weigh it after the stones are removed - 
lay it into a deep dish, and strew over it an equal weight of highly 
refined pounded sugar ; let it remain until this is nearly dissolved, then 
lift the fruit gently into a preserving-pan, pour the juice and sugar to it 



GHAF. XXI.3 PRfiSERVSS. 848 

and heat the whole over a very slow fire ; let it just simmer for ten 
minutes, then turn it softly into a bowl, and let it remain a couple of 
days; repeat the slow-heating and simmering at intervals of two or 
three days, until the fruit is quite clear, when it may be potted in the 
syrup, or drained from it, and dried upon large clean slates or dishes, or 
upon wire-sief^ The flavour will be excellent. The strained juice 
of a lemon may be added to the syrup, with good eflect, towards the 
end of the process, and an additional ounce or two of sugar allowed 
for it 

DAMSON JAM. (VERT GOOD.) 

The fruit for this jam should be freshly gathered and quite ripe. 
Split, stone, weigh, and boil it quickly for forty minutes ; then stir in 
half its weight of good sugar roughly powdered, and when it is dis- 
solved, give the preserve fifteen minutes additional boiling, keeping it 
stirred, and thoroughly skimmed. 

Damsons, stoned, 6 lbs. : 40 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 15 minutes. 

Obs. — A more refined preserve is made by pressing the fruit through 
a sieve after it is boiled tender ; but the jam is excellent without 

DAMSON JELLT. 

Bake separately in a very slow oven, or boil in a water-bath (see 
page 332), any number of fine ripe damsons, and one third the quantity 
of bullaces, or of any other pale plums, as a portion of their juice will, 
to most tastes, improve, by softening the flavour of the preserve, and 
will render the colour brighter. Pour off* the juice clear from the fruit, 
strain and weigh it ; boil it quickly without sugar for twenty-five min- 
utes, draw it from the fire, stir into it ten ounces of good sugar for each 
pound of juice, and boil it quickly from six to ten minutes longer, care- 
fully clearing off all the scum. The jelly must be often stirred before 
the sugar is added, and constantly afterwards. 

DAMSON SOLID. (OOOD.) 

Pour the juice from some damsons which have stood for a night in a 
very cool oven, or been stewed in a jar placed-in a pan of water ; weigh 
and put it into a preserving-pan with a pound and four ounces of pear- 
mains (or of any other fine boiling apples), pared, cored, and quartered, 
to each i)6und of the juice; boil these together, keeping them well 
stirred, from twenty-five to thirty minutes, then add the sugar, and 
when it is nearly dissolved, continue the boiling for ten minutes. This, 
if done with exactness, will give a perfectly smooth and firm preserve, 
which may be moulded in small shapes, and turned out for table. 

To each pound clear damson-juice, 1^ lb. pearmains (or other good 
apples), pared and cored : 25 to 30 minutes. Sugar, 14 ozs. : 10 
minutes. * 

EXCELLENT DAMSON CHEESE. 

When the fruit has been baked or stewed tender, as directed above, 
drain off the juice, skin and stone the damsons, pour back to them from 
a third to half their juice, weigh and then boil them over a clear brisk 
fire until they form a quite dry paste ; add six ounces of pounded sugar 
for each pound of the plums; stir them off the fire until this is dissolved, 
and boil the preserve again without quitting or ceasing to stir it, until it 
leaves the pan quite dry, and adheres in a mass to the spoon. If it 



d44 MODERN COOKERY. [CIIAP. XXli 

should not stick to the fingers when lightly touched, it will be snfSr 
ciently done to keep very long; press it quickly into pans or moulds; 
lay on it a paper dipped in spirit when it is perfectly cold ; tie another 
fold over it, and store it in a dry place. 

Bullace cheese is made in the same manner, and almost any kind of 
plum will make an agreeable preserve of the sort ^ 

To each pound of fruit, pared, stoned, and mixed with the juice, and 
boiled quite dry, 6 ozs. of pounded sugar : boiled again to a dry paste. 

GRAPE JELLY. 

Strip from their stalks some fine ripe black-cluster grapes, and stir 
them with a wooden spoon over a gentle fire until all have burst, and 
the juice flows freely from them ; strain it off without pressure, and pass 
it throuffh a jelly-bag, or through a twice- folded muslin ; weigh and 
then boil it rapidly for twenty minutes; draw it from the fire, stir in it 
till dissolved, fourteen ounces of good sugar, roughly powdered, to each 

Eound of juice, and boil the jelly quicldy for fifteen minutes longer, 
eeping it constantly stirred, and perfectly well skimmed. It will be 
very clear, and of a beautiful pale rose-colour. 

Juice of black-cluster grapes : 20 minutes. To each pound of juice, 
14 ozs. good sugar : 15 minutes. 

06». — We have proved this jelly only with the kind of grape which 
we have named, but there is little doubt that fine purple grapes of any 
sort would answer for it well. 

ENGLISH GUAVA. 

Strip the stalks from a gallon or two of the large kind of bullaces 
called the shepherd's bullace ; give part of them a cut, put them into 
stone jars, and throw into one of them a pound or two of imperatrice 
plums, if they can be obtained ; put the jars into pans of water, and 
lx>il Uiem as directed at pa^e 332 ; then drain off the juice, pass it 
through a thick strainer or jelly-bag, and weigh it; boil it quickly from 
fitleen to twenty minutes ; take it flrom the fire, and stir in it till dis- 
solved, three-quarters of a pound of sugar to the poimd of juice; remove 
the' scum with care, and boil the preserve again quickly from eight to 
twelve minutes, or longer should it not then jelly firmly on the skim- 
mer. When the fruit is very acid, an equal weight of juice and sugar 
may be mixed together in the first instance, and ^iled briskly for about 
twenty minutes. It is impossible to indicate the precise time which 
the jelly will require, so much depends on the quality of the plums, and 
on theJdegrce of boiling previously given to them in the water-bath. 
When properly made, it is remarkably transparent and very firm. It 
should be poured into shallow pans or small moulds, and turned from 
thom before it is served. When the imperatrice plum cannot be pro- 
cured, any other that will give a pale red colour to the juice will 
answer. The bullaces alone make an admirable preserve; and even 
the commoner kind afiS)rd an excellent one. 

Juice of the shepherd's bullace and imperatrice, or other red plum, 
4 lbs. : 15 to 20 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : H to 12 minutes. Or juice of 
bullaces and sugar, equal weight: 20 minutes. 

06*. — After the juice has been poured from the plums they may be 
rtoned, parqd, weighed, and boiled to a paste ; then six ounces of sugar

added to the poand, and the boiling continued until the preserve is again 
very dry : a small portion of the juice should be left with the fruit ftnr 
this. 

TO DRY PLUMS ; (oA casy method.) 

Put them into jars, or wide-necked bottles, with half a pound of 
ffood sugar, rAled or pounded, to twice the weight of fruit; set them 
into a very cool oven for four and five hours ; or if more convenient 
place them, with a little hay between them, in a pan of cold water, and 
boil them gently for rather more than three hours. Leave them in the 
syrup for a few days, and finish them as directed for the drying of other 
fruits. Tie a bladder over the necks of the jars or bottles before they 
are placed in the pan of water, and fasten two or three folds of paper 
over the former, or cork the bottles when the fruit is to be baked. The 
sugar should be "put in after the fruit, without being shaken down ; it 
will then dissolve gradually, and be absorbed by it equally. 

*To each pound of plums, 8 ounces pounded sugar : baked in cool 
oven 4 or 5 hours, or steamed 3 hours. 

TO BOTTLE FRUIT FOR WINTER USE. 

Gather the fruit in the middle of the day in very dry weather ; strip 
off the stalks, and have in readiness some perfectly clean and dry wide* 
necked bottles ; turn each of these the instant before it is filled, with 
the neck downwards, and hold in it two or three lighted matches; drop 
in the fruit before the vapour escapes, shake it gently down, press in 
some new corks, dip the necks of the bottles ii}to melted rosin, set them 
at night into an oven from which the bread has been drawn six or seven 
hours at least, and let them remain until the morning: if the heat be 
too great the bottles will burst Currants, cherries, damsons, green- 
gages, and various other kinds of plums will remain good for quite 
twelve months when bgttled thus if stored in a dxy place. 

To steam the fruit, put the bottles into a copper or other vessel up to 
their necks in cold water, with a little hay between and under them; 
light the fire, let the water heat slowly, and keep it at the point of 
gentle simmering until the fruit is sufiiciently scalded. Some kinds 
will of course require a much longer time than others. From half to 
three-quarters of an hour will be sufficient for gooseberries, currants, 
and raspberries ; but the appearance of all will best denote their being 
done. When they have sunk almost half the depth of the bottles, and 
tlie skins are shrivelled, extinguish the fire, but leave them in the 
water until it is quite cold ; then wipe and store the bottles in a dry 
place. A bit of moistened bladder tied over the corks is better than the 
Toein when the fruit is steamed. 

▲PPLB JELLT. 

Various kinds of apples may be used successfully to make this jelly, 
hut the nonsuch is by man^ persons preferred to all others for the pur- 
pose. The Ripstone pippm, hbwever, may be used for it with very 
good efiect, either solely, or with a mixture of pearmains. It is necos* 
sary only that the fruit should be finely flavoured, and that it should 
boil easily to a marmalade. Pare, core, quarter, and weigh it quickly 
tliat it may not lose its colour, and to each pound pour a pint of cold 
water, ana boil it until it is well broken, without being reduced to a

aaite thick palp, As it woold then be difficult to render the juice per- 
fectly clear, wnich it ought to be. Drain this well irorn the apples, 
either through a fine sieve or a folded muslin strainer, and pass it after- 
wards through a jelly-bag, or turn the fruit at once into the last of 
these, and pour the liquid through a second time if needful. When it 
appears quite transparent, weigh, and reduce it by quick boiling for 
twenty minutes; draw it from tlie fire, add two poundsof sugar, broken 
very small, for three of the decoction, stir it till it is entirely dissolved, 
then place the preserving-pan again over a clear fire, and boil the pre- 
serve quickly for ten minutes, or until it jellies firmly upon the skimmer 
when poured from it ; throw in the strained juice of a small lemon for 
every two pounds of jelly, a couple of minutes before it is taken froa* 
the nre. 

Apples, 7 lbs. ; water, 7 pints : ^ to full hour. Juice, 6 lbs. : 20 
minutes quick boiling. Sugar, 4 lbs.: 10 to 15 minutes. Juice, 3 
lemons. 

EXCEEDINGLY FINE APPLE JELLY. 

Pare quickly some highly flavoured juic^ apples of any kind, or of 
various kinds together, for this is immaterial ; slice, without dividing 
them ; but first free them from the stalks and eyes, shake oat some of 
the pips, and put the apples evenly into very clean large stone jars; jast 
dipping an occasional layer into cold water as this is done, the better to 
preserve the colour of the whole. Set the jars into pans of water, and 
boil the fruit slowly until it is quite soft, then turn it into a jelly-bag or 
cloth, and let the juice all drop from it The quantity which it will 
have yielded will be small, but it will be clear and rich. Weigh and 
boil it for ten minutes, then draw it from the fire, and stir into it, until 
it is entirely dissolved, twelve ounces of good sugar to the pound and 
quarter (or pint) of juice. Place the preserve again over the fire and 
stir it without intermission, except to clear ofiVthe scum, until it has 
boiled from eight to ten minutes longer, for otherwise it will jelly on 
the surface with the scum upon it, which it will then be difficult to re- 
move, as when touched it will break and fall into the preserve. The 
strained juice of one small fresh lemon to the pint of jelly should be 
thrown into it two or three minutes before it is poured out, and the rind 
of one or two cut very thin may be simmefed in the juice before the 
sugar is added ; but the pale, delicate colour of the jelly will be injured 
by too much of it, and many persons would altogetlier prefer the pure 
davour. 

Juice of apples, 1 quart, or 2} lbs. : 10 minutea Sugar, 1} lb. : 8 to 
10 minutes. Juice, 2 small lemons ; rind of 1 or more, at pleasure. 

Obs, 1. — ^The quantity of apples required for it renders this a rather 
expensive preserve, where they ^re not abundant ; but it is a remarka- 
oly fine jelly, and turns out from the moulds in perfect shape and very 
firm. It may be served in the second course, or for dessert It is some- 
\imes made without paring the apples, or dipping them into the water, 
tnd the colour is then a deep red : we have occasionally had a pint of 
water added to about a gallon and a half of apples, but the jelly was 
iiot then quite so fine in flavour. 

Obs. 2. — The best time for making this apple-jelly is from the end 
of November to Christmaa 



CHAP. XXI.3 PRESERVES. 347 

Obs, 3. — Quince-jelly would, without doubt, be very fine made by 
this receipt ; but as the juice of that fruit is richer than that of the 
apple, -a little water might be added. Alternate layers of apples and 
quinces would also answer well, we think. 

QUINCE JELLT. 

Pare, quarter, core, and weigh some ripe but quite sound quinces, as 
quickly as ^possible, and throw them as they are done into part of the 
water in which they are to be boiled, as directed at page 305 ; allow 
one pint of this to each pound of the fruit, and simmer it gently until 
it is a little broken, but not so long as to redden the juice, which ought 
to be very pale. Turn the whole into a jelly-bag, or strain thQ liquid 
through a fine cloth, and let it drain very closely from it, but without 
the slightest pressure. Weigh the juice, put it into a delicately clean 
preserving-pan, and boil it quickly for twenty minutes ; take it from the 
fire and stir into it, until it is entirely dissolved, twelve ounces of sugar 
for each pound of juice, or fourteen ounces if the fruit should be very 
acid, which it will be in the earlier part of the season ; keep it con- 
stantly stirred and thoroughly cleared from scum from ten to twenty 
minutes longer, oi* until it jellies strongly in filing from the skimmer ; 
then pour it directly into glasses or moulds. If properly made, it will 
be sufficiently firm to turn out of the latter, and it will be beautifully 
transparent, and rich in flavour. It may be made with an equal weight 
of juice and sugar mixed together in the first instance, and boiled from 
twenty to thirty minutes. It is difficult to state the time precisely, be- 
cause fi-om difierent causes it will vary very much. It should be re- 
duced rapidly to the proper point, as long boiling injures the colour : 
this is always more perfectly preserved by boiling the juice without the 
su^r first 

To each pound pared and cored quinces, 1 pint water : j to 1^ hour. 
Juice, boiled 20 minutes. To each pound, 12 ozs. sugar : 10 to 20 mi- 
nutes. Or, juice and sugar equal weight: 20 to 30 minutes. 

QUINCE MARMALADE. 

When to economize the fruit is not an object, pare, core, and quar- 
ter some of the inferior quinces, and boil them in as much water as will 
nearly cover them, until they begin to break; strain the juice from 
them, and for the marmalade put half a pint of it to each pound of fresh 
quinces : in preparing these, be careful to cut out the hard stony parts 
round the cores. Simmer them gently until they are perfectly tender, 
then press them, with the juice, Sirough a coarse sieve; put them into 
a perfectly clean pan, and boil them until they form almost a dry paste ; 
add for each pound of quinces and the half pint of juice, three quarters 
of a pound of sugar, in. fine powder, and boil the marmalade for half an 
hour, stirring it gently without ceasing: it will hie very firm ana brigiit 
in colour. If made shortly after the fruit is gathered, a little additional 
sugar will be required ; and when b. richer and less dry marmalade is 
better liked, it must be boiled a shorter time, and an equal weight of 
fruit and sugar must be used. 

Quinces, pared and cored, 4 lbs.; prepared juice, 1 quart: 2 to 3 
hours. Boiled fast to dry, 20 to 40 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 30 mi- 
nutes.

of pearmains, or of any other well-flavoured apples, in an equal weight 
of prepared quince-juice (see page 305), then take them from the fire, 
and mix with them a pound and a half of sugar, in fine powder; when 
this is a little dissolved, set the pan again over a brisk fire, and boil the

QVIIVCE PASTE. 

If the fiill flavour of the (quinces be desired, stew them sufficiently 
tender to press through a sieve in the prepared juice of page 305 ; 
otherwise, in just water enough to about three parts cover them ; when 
they are soft quite through, lift them out, let them cool, and then pass 
them through a sieve ; reduce them to a dry paste, over a very clear 
fire, and stir them constantly ; then weigh the fruit, and mix it with an 
equal proportion of pounded sugar, or with sugar boiled to candy height 
(we find the effect nearly the same, whichever method be pursued), and 
stir the paste without intermission until it is a?ain so dry as to quit the 
pan and adhere to the spoon in one large ball ; press it into shallow 
pans or dishes ; cut it, as soon as cold, into small squares, and, should 
they seem to require it, dry them with a very gentle deg;ree of heat, 
and when they are again cold store them in tin cases with well-dried 
foolscap paper between them ; the paste may be moulded, when more 
convenient, and kept until it is wanted for table in a very dry place. 
In France, where the fruit is admirably confected, the pdte des coigns, 
or quince paste, is somewhat less boiled than we have directed, and 
dried afterwards in the sun, or in an extremely gentle oven, in square 
rims of tin, about an inch and a half deep, placecTupon clean platea 

JELLT OF SIBERIAN CRABS. 

This fruit makes a jelly of beautiful colour, and of pleasant flavour 
also; it may be stored in small moulds of ornamental shape, and turned 
out for a dessert dish. Take oflf the stalks, weigh, and wash the crabs ; 
then, to each pound and a half, add a pint of water, and boil them gently 
until they are broken, but do not allow them to fall to a pulp. Pour the 
whole into a jelly-bag, and when the juice is quite transparent, weigh 
it, put it into a clean preserving-pan, boil it quickly for ten. minutes, 
take it from the fire, and stir in it, till dissolved, ten ounces of fine sugar, 
roughly powdered, to each pound of the juice ; boil the jelly from twelve 
to fifteen minutes, skim it very clean, and pour it into the mould. Should 
the quantity be large, a few additional minutes boiling must be given to

To each IJ lb. of crabs; water, 1 pint: 12 to 18 minutes. Juice to 
be boiled fast, 10 minutes; sugar, to each pound, 10 ozs.: 12 to 15

TO PRESERVE BARBERRIES IN BI^NCHES. 

Take the finest barberries, without stones, that can be procured, tie 
them together in bunches of four or five sprigs, and for each half pound 
of the fi-uit (which is extremely light), boil one pound of very 
«ugar in a pint of water for twenty minutes, and clear it well

Bcarn ; throw in the fruit, let it heat gently, and then boil from five to 
iseven minutes, when it will be perfectly transparent So long as any 
snapping noise is heard, the fruit is not at all done ; it should be pressed 
equally down into the syrup until the whole of the berries have burst; 
It should then be turned into jars, which must be covered with skin, or 
with two or three folds of thick paper, as soon as the preserve is per- 
fectly cold. Ti)e barberries thus prepared make a beautiful garnish for 
Bweet dishes, or for custard puddings. 

Barberries, tied in bunches, 1^ lb. Sugar, 3 lbs.; water, 1^ pint: 
20 minutes. Barberries boiled in syrup, 5 to 7 minutes. 

BARBERRY JELLY. 

To each pound of barberries, stripped from the stalks, put a pint and 
a half of cold water, and boil them for fifteen minutes ; bruise them with 
tlie back of a wooden spoon, pour them into a hair-sieve or muslin 
strainer, and pass the juice afterwards through a jelly-bag. When it 
appears perfectly clear, weigh and then boil it fast for ten minutes ; 
take it from the fire, and stir into it as many pounds of sugar in fine 
powder as there were pounds of juice ; when this is dissolv^, boil the 
jelly again for ten minutes, skim it carefully, and pour it into jars or 
glasses : if into (he latter, warm them previously, or the boiling jelly 
may cause them to break. 

Barberries, 3 lbs.; water, 4} pints: 15 minutes. Juice alone: 10 
minutes. To each pound of^ juice 1 lb. of sugar : 10 minutes. 

BARBERRY JAM. (A good Receipt,) 

The barberries for this preserve should be quite ripe, though they 
should not be allowed to hang until they begin to decay. Strip them 
from the stalks, throw aside such as are spotted, and for each pound of 
the fruit allow eighteen ounces of well-refined sugar ; boil this, with 
one pint of water to every four pounds, until it becomes white, and falls 
in thick masses from the spoon ; then throw in the fruit, and keep it 
stirred over a brisk fire for six minutes only ; take ofiT the scum, and 
pour it into jars or glasses. 

Sugar, 4^ lbs. ; water, 1^ pint, boiled to candy height Barberries, 
4 lbs. : 6 minutes. 

BARBERRY JAM. {Secoud Receipt.') 

The preceeding is an excellent receipt, but the preserve will be very 
ffood if eighteen ounces of pounded sugar be mixed and boiled with the 
fruit for ten minutes ; and this is done at a small expense of time and 
trouble. 

Sugar pounded, 2} Ibe. ; fruit, 2 lbs. : boiled 10 minutes. 

VERY COMMON BARBERRY JAM. 

Weigh the fruit after it has been stripped from the stalks, and boil it 
for ten minutes over a moderate fire, keeping it stirred all the time ; 
then add to it an equal weight of good Lisbon sugar, and boil the pre- 
serve for five minutes. 

Barberries, 3 lbs. : 10 minutes. Lisbon sugar, 3 lbs. : 5 minutes. 

Obs, — The small barberry, without stones, must be used for the fore- 
going receipts, but for those which follow either sort will answer.

SVPSRIOB BARCTKRY JELLT, AND MARMALADB. 

Strip the fruit from the stems, wash it in spring-water, drain, bruise 
it slightly, and put it into a clean stone jar, with no more liquid than 
the drops which han^ about it Place the iar in a pan of water, and 
steam the fruit until is quite tender : this will be in from thirty minutes 
to an hour. Pour off the clear juice, strain, weigh, and boil it fast from 
five to seven minutes, with eighteen ounces of sugar to every pound. 
For the marmalade, press the fiirberries through a sieve with a wooden 
spoon, and boil them quickly for the sauM time, and with the same pro- 
portion of sugar as the jelly. 

Barberries boiled in water-bath until tender ; to each pound of juice, 
1 lb. 2 ozs. sugar: 5 minutes. Pulp of fruit, to each pound, 18 ozs. 
sugar : 5 minutes. 

OAi9. — We have always had these preserves made with very ripe 
fruit, and have found them extremely good ; but more sugar may be 
Deeded to sweeten them sufficiently when the barberries have hung 
less time upon the treea 

ORAHGB MARMALADE. 

Rasp very slightly on a fine and delicately clean grater the rinds of 
0ome sound Seville oranges ; cut them in quarters, and separate the 
flesh from the rinds ; then with the small end of a tea, or egg spoon, 
clear it entirely from the pips, and from the loose inner skin and film. 
Put the rinds into a large quantity of cold water, and change it when 
they have boiled about twentj^ minutes. As soon as they are perfectly 
tender lift them out, and drain them on a sieve ; slice them thin, and 
add eight ounces of them to each pound of the pulp and juice, with a 
pound and a half of highly-refined su^ in one powder; boil the 
marmalade quickly for half an hour, skim it well, and turn it into the 
jars. This marmalade has not a very powerful flavour of the orange- 
rind. When more of this is liked, either leave a portion of the fruit 
nnrasped, or mix with the preserve some of the zest which has been 
grated o^. allowing for it its weight of sugar. Or proceed thus: allow 
to a dozen Seville oranges two fine juicy lemons, and take the weight 
of the whole in sifted sugar, of excellent quality. Witli a sharp knife 
cut through the rinds just deep enough to allow them to be stripped ofiT 
in quarters with the end of a spoon, and throw them fer a night into 
plenty of cold spring-water ; on the fblk>wing morning boil them sufii- 
ciently tender to allow the head of a pin to pierce them .easily ; then 
drain them well, let them cool, and scrape out the white part of the 
rind, and cut the remainder into thin chipei In the mean time have the 
pulp of the fruit (^uite cleared from the pips and film ; put it with the 
sugar and chips mto a preserving-pan, heat it slowly, then boil it firom 
twenty to thirty minutes : it will be very rich, good marmalade. The 
sugar, first broken into large lumps, is sometimes made into a very 
thick syrup, with so much water only as will just dissolve it; the pulp 
and juice are in that case boiled in it quickly for ten minutes before 
the chips are added ; and a part of these are pounded and stirred into 
the preserve with the others. March is the proper month for making 
this preserve, the Seville orange being then in perfection. For lemon 
marmalade proceed exactly in the same manner as for this. The whole 
of the rinds of either fruit are pounded to a paste, and then boiled with 
the pulp, to make what is called transparent marmalade. 



CHAP. XXI.3 PRESERTES. 351 

Rinds of Seville oranges, lightly rasped and boiled tender, 2 lbs. ; 
pulp and juice, 4 lbs. ; su^r, o lbs. : ^ hour. Or, weight of oranges, 
first taken in sugar, and added, with all the rinds, to the pulp after the 
whole has been properly prepared. 

GENUINE SCOTCH MARHAIADE. 

^ Take some bitter oranges, and double their weight of sugar ; cut 
the rind of the fruit into quarters and peel it off, and if the marmalade 
be not wanted very thick, take off some of the spongy white skin in- 
side the rind. Cut the chips as thin as possible, and about half an inch 
long, and divide the pulp into small bits, removing carefully the seeds, 
which may be steeped in part of the water that is to make the marma- 
lade, and which must be in the proportion of a <juart to a pound of fruit. 
Put the chips and pulp into a deep earthen dish, and pour the water 
boiling over them ; let them remain for twelve or fourteen hours, and 
then turn the whole into the preserving-pan, and boil it until the chips 
are perfectly tender. When they are so, add by degrees the sugar 
(which should be previously pounded), and boil the marmalade until it 
jellies. The water in which the seeds have been steeped, and which 
must be taken fh)m the quantity apportioned to the whole of the pre- 
serve, should be poured into a hair-sieve, and the seeds well worked in 
it with the back of a spoon; a strong clear jelly will be obtained by 
this means, which must be washed oft them by pouring their own liquor 
tlirough the sieve in small portions over them. This must be added to 
the fruit when it is first set on the fire. 

Oranges, 3 lbs. ; water, 3 quarts ; sugar, 6 lbs. 

Obs, — This receipt, which we have not tried ourselves, is guarantied 
as an excellent one by the Scotch lady from whom it was procured. 

ORANGE CONSERVE FOR PUDDINGS. 

Wash and then soak in plenty o^ spring-water for three days, chang- 
ing it night and morning, half a dozen Seville oranges ; then boil them 
till they are sufficiently tender for the head of a pin to pierce them 
easily ; drain and weigh them, and for each pound take and reduce to 
fine powder two pounds of good sugar. Cut the oranges asunder, and 
remove the pips and the coarse loose skin of the cores ; then beat them, 
with the sugar, in a large mortar, and pick out as this is done any pits 
of fibre or coarse inner skin which cannot be reduced to a paste. When 
the whole forms a smooth conserve, put it into small jars for use, as it 
requires no boiling after the fruit and sugar are mixed : if stored in a 
dry place, it will remain good for two years. Each orange should be 
tied in a thin small cloth or a bit of muslin Avhen it is boiled, and the 
water should be changed once (or even twice when the fine aromatic 
bitter of the rind is altogether objected to), or the fruit may be lifted 
from the water and tlirown immediately into another pan containing 
more which is ready boiling. Two tablespoonsful of this conserve, 
with the yolks of five or six eggs, a couple of ounces of sugar, and as 
much clarified butter smoothly mixed and well beaten together, wiL 
make good cheesecakes, or an excellent but not large pudding: the 
same proportion will be found an agreeable addition to a plum-pndding 
also. 

Seville oranges, boiled tender, 2 lbs. ; sugar, 4 lbs. ; beaten together, 
not boiled.

CHAPTER XXII. 
PICKLES. 

OBSERVATIONS Olf PICKLES. 

The first requisite in making pickles is to have unadulterated viue- 
gar, for all the expense and trouble bestowed upon them is often 
entirely lost in consequence of ingredients being mixed with this which 
soften, and sometimes even partially decompose, the substances im- 
mersed in it. That which is home-made is generally found for all pur- 
poses to answer best, and it may be prepared of almost any degree of 
strength by increasing the ordinary proportion of fruit and sugar, or 
whatever else may be used for it Tho refuse of raisin -wine, and 
green gooseberries, may both be converted into excellent vinegar: but 
unless the pickles be quite covered with their liquor, and well protected 
from the air, and from the influence of damp^. which is more than any- 
thing destructive of them, the purity of the vinegar will not preserve 
them eatable. We can confidently recommend to the reader the 
rather limited number of receipts which follow, and which might 
easily be multiplied did the size of our volume permit Pickling is so 
easy a process, however, that when in any degree prpperly acquired, it 
may be extended to almost every kind of fruit and vegetable success- 
fully. A few of the choicer kinds will nevertheless be found generally 
more acceptable than a greater variety of inferior preparations. Mush- 
rooms, gherkins, walnuts, lemons, eschalots, and peaches, for all of 
which we have given minute directions, will furnish as much choice as 
is commonly required. 

TO PICKLJ^ CHERRIES. 

Leave about an inch of tlieir stalks on some fine, sound cherries, that 
are not over-ripe ; put them into a jar, cover them with cold vinegar, 
and let them stand for three weeks; pour off two-thirds of the liquor 
and replace it with fresh vinegar; then, afler having drained it 
from the fruit, boil the whole with an ounce of coriander seed, a small 
blade of mace, a few grains of cayenne, or a teaspoonful of white pep- 
percorns, and four bruised cochineals to every quart, all tied loosely in a 
fold of muslin. Let the pickle become quite cold before it is added to 
the cherries : in a month they will be fit for use. The vinegar which 
is poured from the fruit makes a good syrup of itself when boiled with 
a pound of sugar to the pint, but it is improved by having some fresh 
raspberries, cherries, or currants previously infused in it for three or 
four days. 

TO PICKLE GHERKINS,* OR CUCUMBERS. 

Let the gherkins be gathered on a dry day, before the frost has 
touched them ; take off the blossoms, put them into a stone iar, and pour 
over them sufficient boiling brine to cover them well. The following 
day take them out, wipe them singly, lay them into a clean stone jar, 

* Small cucumberg. All cucumbers may be pickl«d in the same way. 



CHAP. ZZII.] PICKLES. 853 

with a dozen ba^-leaves over them, and pour upon them the 'following 
pickle, when it is boiling fast : as much vmegar as will more than cover 
the gherkins by an inch or two, with an ounce and a quarter of salt, a 

2uarter-ounce of black peppercorns, an ounce and a half of ginger 
liced, or slightly bruised, and two small blades of mace to every quart; 
put a plate over the jar, and leave it for two days, then drain off the 
vinegar, and heat it afresh : when it boils, throw in the gherkins, and 
keep them just on the point of simmering for two or three minutes ; 
pour the whole back into the jar, put the plate again upon it, and let it 
remain until the pickle is quite cold, when a skin, or two separate folds 
of thick brown paper, must be tied closely over it The gherkins thus 
pickled are very crisp, and excellent in flavour, and the colour is suffi- 
ciently good to satisfy the piudent housekeeper, to whom the brilliant 
and poisonous green produced by boiling the vinegar in a brass skillet 
(a process constantly recommended in books of cookery) is anything 
but attractive. To satisfy ourselves of the effect produced by the action 
of the acid on the metal, we had a few gherkins thrown into some 
vinegar which was boiling in a brass pan, and nothing could be more 
beautiful than the colour which they almost immediately exhibited. 
We fear this dangerous method is too often resorted to in preparing 
pickles for sale. 

Brine to pour on gherkins; — 6 oza salt to each quart water: 24 
hours. Pickle : — to each quart vinegar, salt, 1|^ oz. ; black peppercorns, 
i oz. ; ginger, sliced or bruised, 1^ oz. ; mace, 2 small blades; bay- 
leaves ; 24 to 100 gherkins, more when the flavour is liked : 2 days. 
Gherkins simmered in vinegar, 2 to 3 minutes. 

PICKIiEB. 

Obs. — ^The quantity of vinegar required to cover the gherkins will 
be shown by that of tiie brine : so much depends upon their size, that 
it is impossible to direct the measnre exactly. A larger proportion of 
epice can be added at pleasure. 

TO PICKLE NASTURTIUMS. 

These should be gathered quite young, and a portion of the buds, 
when very small, should be mixed with them. Prepare a pickle by 
dissolving an ounce and a half of salt in a quart of pale vinegar, and 
throw in the berries as they become fit, from day to day. They ar^ 
used instead of capers for sauce, and by some persons are prefeired to 
them. When purchased for pickiing, put them at once into a jar, and 
cover them well with the vinegar. 

TO PICKLE PEACHES. 

Take, at their full growth, just before they begin to ripen, six large 
or eight moderate-sized peaches ; wipe the down from them, and put 
them into brine that will float an egg. In three days let them be taken 
out, and drained on a sieve reversed for several hours. Boil in a quart 
of vinegar for ten minutes two ounces of whole white pepper, two of 
ginger slightly bruised, a teaspoonful of salt, two blades of mace, half a 
pound of mustard-seed, and a half-teaspoonful of cayenne tied in a bit 
of muslin. Lay the peaches into a jar, and pour the boiling pickle on 
them : in two months they will be fit for use. 

Peaches, 6 or 8 : in brine 3 day& Vinegar, 1 quart ; whole white 
30* 



964 MODERN CX>OKERY. [cHAP. XXU. 

pepper, 2 ozs. ; bruised ginger, 2 ozs.; salt, 1 teaspoonful ;* mace, 2 
blaaes ; mustard-seed, ^ lb. : 10 minutes. 

Obg. — ^The peaches may be converted into excellent mangoes by cut- 
ting out from the 8talk>end of each a round of sufficient size to allow 
the stone to be extracted : this should be done after they are taken from 
the brine. They may be filled with very fresh mustard-seed, previously 
washed in a little vinegar ; to this a small portion of garlic, or bruised 
eschalots, cayenne, horse-radish, chilies (the most appropriate of any), 
or spice of any kind may be added, to the taste. The part cut out must 
be replaced, and secured with a packthread crossed over the fruit. 

TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS. 

Select for this purpose, if they can be procured, the smallest buttons 
of the wild or meadmo mushrooms, in preference to those which are 
artificially raised, and let them be as freshly gathered as possible. Cut 
the stems ofi^ quite close, and clean them with a bit of new flannel 
slightly moistened, and dipped in fine salt; throw them as they are done 
into plenty of spring- water, mixed with a large spoonful of salt, but drain 
them from it quickly afterwards, and lay them mto a sod cloth to dry, 
or the moisture which hangs about them will too much weaken the 
pickle. For each quart of the mushrooms thus prepared, take nearly a 
quart of the palest white wine vinegar (this is far superior to the dis- 
tilled vinegar generally used for the purpose, and the variation in the 
colour of the mushrooms will be very slight), and add to it a heaped 
teaspoonful of salt, half an ounce of whole wliite pepper, an ounce of 
ginger, sliced or lightly bruised, about the fourth of a* saltspoonful of 
^ cayenne, tied in a small bit of muslin, and two large blades of mace; 
to these may be added half a small nutmeg, sliced ; but too much spice 
will entirely overpower the fine natural flavour of the mushrooms^ 
When the pickle boils, throw them in, and boil them in it over a clear 
fire moderately &st from six to nine minutes, or somewhat longer, should 
they not be very small. When they are much disproportioned in size, 
the larger ones should have two minutes boil before the others are thrown 
. into the vinegar. As soon as they are tolerably tender, put them at 
once into small stone jars, or into warm wide-necked bottles, and divide 
the spice eoually amongst them. The following day, or as soon as they 
are perfectly cold, secure them from the air with large corks, or tie 
skins and paper over them. They should be stored in a dry place, and 
guarded from severe frost. When the colour of the mushrooms is more 
considered than the excellence of the pickle, the distilled vinegar can 
be used tor it The reader may rely upon this receipt as a really good 
one; we have had it many times proved, and it is altogether our own. 

Mushroom-buttons (without the stems), 2 quarts ; palest white wine 
vinegar, short ^ gallon ; salt, large dessertspoonful, or 1]^. oz. ; white 
peppercorns, 1 oz. ; whole ginger, 2 ozs. ; cayenne, small ^ saltspoon- 
ful; 1 small nutmeg. 

MUSHROOMS IN BRINE ; {for winter use,) ( Very good,) 

We have had small mushroom-buttons excellently preserved through 
the winter prepared as follows, and we therefore give the exact pro- 
portions which we had used for them, though the same quantity of brine 
would possibly allow of rather more mushrooms in it Prepare them 
exactly as for the preceding pickle, and measure them after the stems 



CHAP. XZU.] PICKLES. 365 

are taken off For each quart, boil together for Sve mimites two qoarts 
of water, with half a pound of common white salt, a small dessertspoon^ 
ful of white peppercorns, a couple of blades of mace, and a race of gin- 
ger ; take on the scum thoroughly, and throw in the mushrooms ; ooil 
them gently for about five minutes, then put tliem into well-warmed« 
wide-necked bottles, and let them become perfectly cold, pour a littles 
good salad oil on the top, cork them with new corks, and tie bladder 
over, or cover them with two separate bladders. When wanted for 
use, soak the mushrooms in warm water till the brine is sufficiently 
extracted. 

Mushrooms, 1 quart ; water, i gallon ; salt, i lb. ; peppercorns, 1 
small dessertspoonful; mace, 2 blades; ginger, 1 race: 5 minutes. 
Mushrooms, in brine, 5 minutes. 

, TO PICIOiE WALNUTS. 

The walnuts for this pickle must be gathered while a pin can pierce 
them easily, for when once the shell can be felt, they have ceased to be 
in a proper state for it. Make sufficient brine to cover them well, with 
six ounces of salt to the gallon of water; take off the scum, which will 
rise to the surface as the salt dissolves, throw in the walnuts, and stir 
them night and morning ; change the brine every three days, and if 
they are wanted for immediate eating, leave them mit for twelve days; 
otherwise, drain them from it in nine, spread them on dishes, and let 
them remain exposed to the air until they become black; this will be in 
twelve hours, or less. Make a pickle for them with something more 
than half a gallon of vinegar to the hundred, a teaspoonful of salt, two 
ounces of black pepper, three of bruised giujpfer, atlrachm of mace, and 
from a quarter to half an ounce of cloves (of which some may be stuck 
into three or four small onions), and four ounces of mustard-seed. Boil 
the whole of these together for about five minutes ; have the walnuts 
ready in a stone jar, or jars, and pour it on them as it is taken from the 
fire. When the pickle is quite cold, cover the jar securely, and store it 
in a dry placed Keep the walnuts always well covered with the vine- 
gar, and boil that which is added to them. 

Walnuts, 100; in brine made with 12 ozs. salt to 2 quarts water, and 
changed twice or more, 9 or 12 days. Vinegar, full ^ gallon ; salt, 1 
teaspoonful; whole black pepper, 2 ozs.; ginger, 3 ozs.; mace, 1 
drachm ; cloves, ^ to ^ oz. ; small onions, 4 to 6 ; mustard-seed, 4 ozs. : 
5 minutes. 

TO PICKLE BEET-ROOT. 

Boil the beet-root tender by the directions of page 247, and when it 
is quite cold, pare and slice it ; put it into a jar, and cover it with com- 
mon vinegar previously boiled and allowed to become again perfectly 
cold : it will soon be ready for use. It is excellent when merely covered 
with vinegar. A few small onions may be boiled in the pickle for it 
when their.flavour is liked. 

To each quart vinegar, salt, 1 teaspoonful ; cayenne tied in musiin, 
i saltspoonful, or white peppercorns, i to whole oz. 

PICKLED ESCHALOTS. 

For a quart of s>?ady-peeled eschalots, add to the same quantity of the 
ocst pale white-wine vinegar, a dessertspoonful of salt, and an ounce of 



860 MODKKN COOKERY. [OHAP. XXH. 

whole white pepper; hring theee quickly to a boll, take off the scum, 
throw in tiie eschalot simmer them for two minutes only^, turn them 
into a clean stone jar, and when they are quite cold, tie a skin, or two 
folds of thick paper over it 

Eschalots, 1 quart; vinegar, 1 quart; salt, 1 dessertspoonful; whole 
white peroer, 1 oz. 

Ob9, — The sooner the eschalots are pickled after they are ripe and 
dry, the better they will be. 

PICKLED ONIONS. 

Take the smallest onions that can be procured, just after they are 
harvested, for they are never in so good a state for the purpose as then ; 
proceed, after having peeled them, exactly as for the eschalots, and 
when they begin to look clear, which will be in three or four minutes, 
put them into jars, and pour the pickle on them. The vinegar should 
oe very pale, and their colour will then be exceedingly well preserved. 
Any &vourite spices can be added to it. 

TO PICKLE LEMONS AND LIMES ; {excettenL) 

Wipe eight fine sound lemons very clean, and make, at equal dis- 
tances, four deep incisions in each, from the stalk to the blossom end, but 
without dividing the fruit; stuff them with as much salt as they will 
contain, lay them into a deep dish, and place them in a sunnv window, 
or in some warm placQ.for a week or ten days, keepinof them often 
turned and basted with their own liquor ; then rub them with some good 
pale turmeric, and put them with their juice, into a stone jar with a 
small head of garlic, divided into cloves and peeled, and a dozen small 
onions stuck with twice as many cloves. Boil in two quarts of white- 
wine vinegar, half a pound of ginger lightly bruised, two ounces of 
whole black pepper, and halfja pound of mustard-seed ; take them from 
the fire and pour them directly on the lemons ; cover the jar with a 

Elate, and let tibem remain till the following day, then add to the pickle 
alf a dozen capsicums (red peppers), and tie a skin and a fold of thick 
paper over the jar. 

Large lemons stufi^ with salt, 8 : 8 to 10 days. Turmeric, 1 to 2 
0Z& ; ginger, i lb. ; mustard-seed, ^ lb. ; capsicums, 6 ozs. 

0&«.— -The turmeric and garlic may, we think, be omitted from this 

IHckle with advantage. It will remain good for seven vears if the 
emons be kept well covered with vinegfar ; that which is added to them 
should be boiled and then left till cold before it is poured into the jar. 
The lemons will not be fit for table in less than twelve months; but if 
wanted for more immediate use, set them for one nisfht into a cool oven 
after the bread is drawn ; they may then be eaten almost direcdy. 

Limes must have but slight incisions made in the rinds ; and they 
will be sufficiently softened m four or five days. Two ounces of salt 
only will be required for half a dozen; and all which remains unmelted 
must, with their juice, be put into the jar with them before the vinegar 
is poured on : this should be mixed with spice and mustard-seed, and be 
boiling when it is added to the limes. 

TO PICKLE BARBERRIES AND SIBERIAN CRABS. 

When wanted for gfcirnishingr only, take the fruit before it is very 
ripe, cut half the len^ of their stalks from the crabs, and free the 



CHAP. UCUl.] CAKE8. S57 

barberries from the leaves, and bom any discoloured berries that may bft 
amongst them. Put them into stone Jars, and cover them well with 
brine, which has been boiled and left to become perlectly cold. Look 
at them occasionally during the winter, and should anj scum or mould 
have gathered oa the surface, clear it well o^ drain the brine doeelj 
from the fi-uit, and fill the jars with Bome that is freshly made. Six 
ounces of salt, and a morsel of alum half the size of a bean to the quart 
of water should be boiled together for ten minutes, and well skimmedi 
both lor the lirst brine, and ^r any that may be required afterwards 

To pickle these fruits in vinegar, add the alum to a sufficient quanti^ 
to cover them, and hoil it with a few white peppercorns, which must M 
strained out before it is poured into the jars : it must be quite cold when 
added 1« the barberries or crabs ; these last should not be ripe when 
tbe^ are used, or they will burst in the pickle; tliey should hav8 
attained their growth and full colour, but be still hard. 



CHAPTER XXIIL 
CAKES. 



L REMABSa on CASES. 

Tbb ingredients for cakes, as well as tor puddings, should all be fresh 
and good, as well as tree from damp; the lightness of many kinds de- 
pends entirely on that given to the eggs by whisking, and 1^ the man- 
ner in which tlie wh<rte is mixed. A tmaa portion of carbonate of 
soda, Vfhich will not be in the slightest degree perceptible to the taste 
after the calte is baked, if thrown in just before the miiture is put into 
the oven, will ensure its rising well. 

_ To guard a^inst the bitterness so often imparted by yeaat when il is 
used for cakes or biscuits, it should be tparinfrly added, and the sponge 
should be left twice the usual time to rise. This method will be foun^

lo answer equally with bread. For example : should a couple of epoons- 
fa) of yeast be ordered in a receipt, when it is bitter, use but one, and 
IK it stand two hours instead of half the time : the fermentation, though 
now, will be quite as perfect as if it were more quickly effected, and 
the cake or loaf thus made will not become dry by any means so soon 
V if a large portion of yeast were mixed with it 

All light cakes require a rather brisk oven to raise and set them ; 
Tery large rich ones a well-sustained degree of heat sufficient to bake 
them through; and small sugar-cakes a very slow oven, to prevent 
their taking a deep colour before they are i^lf done: gingerbread too 
should be gently baked, unless it be of the light thick kind. Merin- 
gues, macaroons, and ratafias, will bear a slight degree more of heat 
than these. 

For sponffe and savoy cakes the French butter their moulds thickly, 
and shake fine sugar m them until they are equally covered with it : 
the loose sugar must be turned out before they are used. 

To ascertain whether a cake be done, thrust a knife into the centre, 
uid should this come out clean draw it from the oven directly ; but 
should the paste adhere to it, continue the baking. Several sheets of 
paper are placed usually under large plum^cakes. 

TO BLANCH AKMONIMi. 

Put them into a saucepan with plenty of cold water, and heat it slowly ; 
when it is just scalding, turn the almonds into a basin, peel, and throw 
them into cold water as they are done : dry them well in a soft cloth 
before they are used. If the water be too hot, it will turn them yellow. 

TO POUHB AUfONDS. 

Almonds are more easily pounded, and lees liable to become oily, if 
dried a little in a very gentle degree of heat after they are blanched ; left 
for example, in a warm room for two or three days, lightly spread on a 
large dish or tin. They should be sprinkled during the beatmg with a 
few drops of cold water, or white of esgt or lemon-juice, and pounded 
to a smooth paste : this is more easily Suie, we believe, when they are 
first roughly chopped, but we prefer to have them thrown at once into 
the mortar. 

TO REDUCE ALMONDS TO A PASTE. (7^6 qiAokext and easiest way,) 

Chop them a little on a large and very clean trencher, then with a 
paste-roller (rolling-pin), which ought to be thicker in the middle than 
at the ends, roll them well until no small bits are perceptible amongst 
them. We have found this method answer admirably ; but as some of 
the oil is expressed from the almonds by it, and absorbed by the board, 
we would recommend a marble slab for them in preference, when it is 
at hand; and should they be intended for a sweet dish, that some 
pounded sugar should be strewed under them. When a board or 
strong trencher is used, it should be rather higher in the middle than 
at the sides. 

TO COLOUR ALMONDS VOR OAXES, OR PAfiTTRT. 

Blanch, dry, and chop them rather coarsely ; pour a little prepared 
cochineal into the hands, and roll the almonds between them until they 
Rre equally coloured ; then spread them on a sheet of paper, and place 



CHAP* XXni.] GAKS8. '^ $Sl9 

them in a very gentle degree of heat to dry. Use spinach-juice (see 
page 233) to colour them green, and a stnmg- infusion of saf&on to give 
them a yellow tint. They have a pretty ef^t when strewed over the 
icing of tarts or cakes, especially the rose-coloured ones, which should 
he rather pale. 

TO FREPABB BVTTER BOB BICH OAKBS. 

For all large and very rich cakes the usual directions are, to beat 
the butter to a cream ; I vt we find that they are quite as light, if not 
more so, when it is cut small and gently melted with just so much 
heat as will dissolve it, and no more. If it be shaken round in a sauce- 
pan previously warmed, and held near the fire for a short time, it will 
soon be liquefied, which is all that is required : it must on no account 
be hoi when it is added to^the other ingredients, to which it must be 
poured in small portions after they are all mixed, in the way which we 
nave minutely described in the receipt for a Madeira cake, and that of 
the Sutherland puddings (Chapter XVIIL) To cream it, drain the 
water well from it, after it is cut, soften it a little bt^fbre the fire should 
it be very hard, and then with the back of a large strong wooden spoon 
beat it until it resembles thick cream. When prepared thus, the sugar 
JR added to it first, and then the other ingredients in succession. 

TO WHISK EG68 FOR~ LIGHT BICH CAKES. 

Break them one by one, and separate the yolks from the whites : this 
is done easily by pouring the yolk from one half of the shell to the 
other, and letting the white drop from it into a basin beneath. With a 
>small three-pronged fork take out the specks from each eg^ as it is 
Inroken, that none may accidentally escape notice. Whisk the yolks 
until they appear light, and the whites until they are a quite solid froth ; 
while any liquid remains at the bottom of the bowl- they are not sufiS- 
ciently beaten : when a portion of them, taken up with the whisk, and 
dropped from it, remains standing in points, they are in the proper state 
fer nse, and should be mixed into the cake directly, 

OBANOB-FLOWBR MACABOONB. (DELICIOUS.) 

Have ready two pounds of very dry white sifted sugar. Weigh two 
ounces of the petals of freshly-gathered orange-blossoms after thej 
have been picked from the stems ; and cut them very small with a pair 
of scissors irUo the susfar, as they will become discoloured if not mixed 
with it quickly after they are cut. When all are done, add the whites 
of seven eggs, and beat the whole well together till it looks like snow ; 
then drop the mixture upon paper without delay, and send the cakes to 
a very cool oven. 

Pounded si^r, 2 lbs. ; orange-blossoms, 2 ozs. ; whites <^ eggs, 7 : 
20 minutes, or more. 

06s. — It is almost impossible to state with accuracy the precise time 
required for these cakes, so much depends on the oveil : they should be 
very delicately coloured, and yet dried through. 

ALMOND MACABOONS. 

Blanch a pound of fresh Jordan almonds, wipe them dry, and set 
them into a very CQpl oven to render them perfectly so ; pound them to 
an exceedingly smooth paste, with a little white of egg \ then whisk to 



860 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP. XXin. 

a finn solid froth the whites of seven eggs, or of eight, shoald they he 
small ; mix with them a pound and a half of the finest sugar ; add 
these by degrees to the almonds, whisk the whole up well together, 
and drop the mixture upon wafer-paper, which may be procured at the 
confectioner's : bake them in a moderate oven a very pale brown. It is 
an improvement to the flavour of these cakes to substitute an ounce of 
bitter almonds for one of the sweet: they are sometimes made with an 
equal weight of each ; and another variety of them is obtained by 
gently browning the almonds in a slow oven before they are pounded. 

Jordan almonds blanched, 1 lb. ; sugar, 1} lb. ; whites of 7 or 8 eggs: 
15 to 20 minutes. 

IMPERIALS. (NOT TERT RICH.) 

Work into a pound of flour six ounces of button and mix well with 
them half a pound of sifted sugar, six ounces c^ currants, two ounces 
of candied orange-peel, the grated rind of a lemon, and four well-beaten 
eggs. Flour a tin lightly, and with a couple of forks place the paste 
upon it in small rough heaps quite two inches apart Bake them in a 
very gentle oven, from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, or until 
they are equally coloured to a pale brown. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; butter, 6 ozs. ; sugar,'8 ozs. ; currants, 6 ozs. ; candied 
peel, 2 ozs. ; rind of 1 lemon ; eggs, 4: 15 to 20 minutes. 

VERT GOOD SMAUi RICH CAKES. 

Beat and mix well together four eggs properly whisked, and half a 
pound of fine sifted suffar ; pour to them by degrees a quarter pound of 
clarified butter, as litue warmed as possible ; stir lightly in with these 
four ounces of dry sifted flour, beat the mixture for about ten minutes^ 

Eut it into small buttered patty-pans, and bake the cakes a quarter of an 
our in a moderate oven. They should be flavoured with the rasped or 
grated rind of a small lemon, or with pounded mace or cinnamon. 

E^gs, 4 ; susar, ^ lb. ; butter, 4 ozs. ; flour, 4 ozs. ; lemon-rind, mace, 
or cmnamon : haked, 15 minutes. 

ALMOND ROOHER. 

Chop very fine together eight ounces of almonds, blanched, and 
dried, six of candied orange-rind, or of orange and lemon-rind mixed, 
and one ounce of citron ; then add to them two ounces of flour, three 
quarters of a pound of sugar, a small teaspoonful of mace and cinna- 
mon mixed, and the whites of three large eggs ; roll the mixture into 
balls about the size of a large marble, and bake them on wafer-paper 
twenty minutes in a moderate oven : they should be quite crisp, but not 
.deeply coloured. 

Almonds, 8 ozs. ; candied orange-rind, 6 ozs. ; citron, 1 oz. ; flour, 2 
ozs. ; sugar, | lb. ; mace and cinnamon mixed, 1 teaspoonfiil ; whites 
of eggs, 3 large : baked, moderate oven, 20 minutes. 

Obs, — When the flavour is not disliked, it will be found an improve- 
ment to substitute an ounce of hitter almonds for one of the sweet; and 
we prefer the whole of the almonds and candied peel also cut into 
spikes instead of being chopped : the ingredients must then be made 
into a lighter paste, and placed in small heaps on the paper. 

BITTER ALMOND BISCUITS. 

Blanch, and then chop as fine as possible, two ounces of bitter almonds, 



CHAP. ZZni.3 CAKES. 361 

and add them to half a pound of flour, half a pound of sifted sugar, and 
two ounces of butter, previously well mixed together. Whisk the 
whites of a couple of eggs to a strong froth, beat them lightly to the 
other ingredients, drop the cakes on a buttered tin, or copper oyen-lea( 
and bake them rather slowly from ten to twelve minutes : they should 
be very small. Should the proportion of bitter almonds be considered 
unhealthful, use half as many, and substitute sweet ones for the re- 
mainder. 

Flour, i lb.; sugar, i lb.; butter, 2 ozs. ; bitter almonds, 2 ozs.; 
whites of eggs, 2: slow oven, 10 to 12 minutes. 

FINE ALMOND CAKE. 

Blanch, dry, and pound to the finest possible paste, eight ounces of 
fresh Jordan almonds, and one ounce of bitter ; moisten them with a 
few drops of cold water or white of egg, to prevent their oiling ; then 
mix with them very gradually twelve fresh eggs which have been 
whisked until they are exceedingly light; throw in by degrees one 
pound of -fine, dry, sifted sugar, and keep the mixture li^ht by constant 
beating, with a large wooden spoon, as the separate m^^redients are 
added. Mix in by degrees three quarters of a pound of dried and sifted 
flour of the best quality ; then pour gently from the sediment a pound 
of butter which has been just melted, but not allowed to become hot, 
and beat it very gradually, but very thoroughly, into the cake, letting 
one portion entirely disappear before another is thrown in: add the 
rasped or finely-grated rinds of two sound fresh lemons, fill a thickly- 
buttered mould rather more than half full with the mixture, and base 
the cake from an hour and a half to two hours in a well-heated oven. 
Lay paper over the top when it is sufficiently coloured, and guard care- 
fully against it being burned. 

Sweet almonds, ^ lb. ; bitter almonds, 1 oz. ; eggs, 12 ; sugar, 1 lb. , 
flour, I lb. ; butter, 1 lb. ; rinds lemons, 2 : 1^ to 2 hours. 

Obs. — ^Three quarters of a pound of almonds may be mixed with this 
cake when so large a portion of them is liked, but an additional ounce 
or two of sugar, and one egg or more, will^then be required. 

POUND CAKE. 

Mix, as directed in the foregoing receipt, ten eggs (some cooks take 
a pound in weight of these), one pound of sugar, one of flour, and as 
much of butter. A ^lass of brandy and a pound of currants may be 
added very gradually just before the cake is put into the oven, with any 
spice that is liked ; and two or three ounces of candied orange or lemon- 
rind, sliced thin, or an ounce of caraway-seeds, may supply the place 
of all. A cake made with half the quantity of the ingredients must be 
baked one hour. 

RICE CAKE. 

Take six eggs, with their weig^ht in fine sugar, and in butter also^ 
and half their weight of flour of rice, and half of wheaten flour; make 
the cake as directed for the Madeira or almond cake, but throw in the 
rice after the flour : then add the butter in the usual way, lad bake the 
cake about an hour and ten minutes. Give any flavour thaC la liked. 
The butter may be altogether cmiitted. This is a moderate-sized cake. 

81 



362 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXIII. 

Eggg, in the Bhell, 6 ; their weight in hutter and in sugar ; half as 
much flour of rice, and the same of wheaten flour: 1 hour, 10 minutes. 

WHITE CAKB. 

Beat half a pound of fresh butter to a cream, add to it an equal weight 
of dried and sifted sugar, the yolks and whites of eight eggs, separately- 
whisked, two ounces of candied orange-peel, half a teaspoonful of mace, 
a glass of brandy, one pound of flour strewed in by degrees, and last of. 
all a pound and a quarter of currants. Directly it is mixed send the 
cake to a well-heated oven, and bake it for a couple of hours. Four 
ounces of beaten almonds are sometimes added to it 

Butter, I lb. ; sugar, i lb. ; eggs, 8 ; mace, J teaspoonful ; brandy, 1 
wineglassml ; flour, 1 lb.; candieid peel, 2 ozs.; currants, 1^ lb.: 2 
hours. 

A GOOD SPONGE CAKE. 

Rasp on some lumps of well-refined sugar the rind of a fine sound 
lemon, and scrape off" the part which has imbibed the essence, or crush 
the plums to powder, and add them to as much more as will make up 
the weight of eight or ten firesh eggs in the shell; break these one by 
one, and separate the whites from the yolks ; beat the latter in a large 
bowl for ten minutes, then strew in the sugar gradually, and beat them 
well together. In the mean time let the whites be whisked to a quite 
solid froth, add them to the yolks, and when they are well blended sift 
and stir the flour gently to them, but do not beat it into the mixture ; 
pour the cake into a well-buttered mould, and bake it an hour and a 
quarter in a moderate oven. 

Rasped rind, 1 large lemon; fresh eggs, 8 or 10; their weight of dry, 
sifted sugar ; and half their weight of flour : baked, 1^ hour, moderate 
oven. 

A SMALLER SPONGE CAKE. {Very gOod.) 

Five full-sized eggs, the weight of fixir in su^ar, and of nearly three 
in flour, will make an exceedingly good cake : it may be flavoured, like 
the preceding one, with lemon-rind, or with bitter almonds, vanilla, or 
confected orange-blossoms reduced to powder. An hour will bake it 
thoroughly. All the ingredients for sponge cakes should be of good 
- quality, and the sugar and flour should & dry ; they should also be 
passed through a fine sieve kept expressly for such purposes. The ex- 
cellence of the whole depends much on the manner in which the eggs 
are whisked ; this should be done as lightly as possible ; but it is a mid- 
take to suppose Chat they cannot be too long beaten, as after they are 
brought to a state of perfect firmness they are injured by a continuation 
of the whisking, and will at times curdle, or render a cake heavy from 
this cause. 

A SPONGE CAKE. (^Good and quickly made.) 

Beat together for between twenty and thirty minutes the yolks of 
nine and the whites of five fresh eggs ; then by degrees add three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar, and six and a half of flour. Flavour it 
or not, at choice, with the grated rind of a lemon, and bake it an booPt 
or rather more, in a brisk oven. 

A GOOD MADEIRA CAKE. 

Whisk fi>ur fresh eggs until they are as light as poasible, then, con- 



cHiP. x^an.} CAKB8. 363 

tinuing still to whisk them, throw in by alow degrees the fbllowinfir in- 
gredients in the order in which they are written : six ounces of dry, 
pounded, and sifled sugar ; six of flour, also dried and sifted ; four 
ounces of butter just dissolved, but not heated ; the rind of a fresh 
lemon ; and the instant before the cake is moulded, beat well in the 
third of a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda : bake it an hour in a mode- 
rate oven. In this, as in all compositions of the same nature, observe 
particularly that each portion of butter must be beaten into the mixture 
until no appearance of it remains be&re the next is added ; and if this 
be done, and the preparation be kepi light by constant and light whisk- 
ing, the cake will be as good, if not better, than if the batter were 
creamed. Candied citron can be added to the paste, but it is not 
needed. 

^ggSf 4; sugar, 6 ozs. ; flour, 6 ozs. ; butter, 4 ozs. ; rind of 1 lemon, 
carbonate of scxla, i of teaspoonful : 1 hour, moderate oven. 

BANBUBT CAKES. 

First, mix well together a pound of currants, cleaned with great 
nicety and dried, a (quarter-pound of beef-suet, finely minced, three 
ounces each of candied orange and lemon-rind, shred small, a few 
grains of salt, a full quarter-ounce of pounded cinnamon and nutmeg 
mixed, and four ounces of macaroons or ratafias rolled to powder. Next, 
make a light paste with fourteen ounces of butter to the pound of flour; 
give it an extra turn or two to prevent its rising too much in the oven ; 
roll out one half in a very thin square, and spread the mixed fi-uit and 
spice equally upon it; moisten the edges, lay on the remaining half of 
the paste, rolled equally thin, press the edges securely together, mark 
the whole with the back of a knife in regular divisions of two inches 
wide and three in length ; bake the pastry in a well-heated oven from 
tweoty^five to thirty minutes, and divide it into cakes while it is still 
warm. They may be served as a second-course dish either hot or cold, 
and may be glazed at pleasure. 

Currants, 1 lb.; beef-suet, 4 ozs.; candied orange and lemon-rind 
each, 3 ozs. ; salt, small pinch ; mixed spices, i oz. ; macaroons or 
ratafias, 4 ozs. : baked 25 to 30 minutes. 

MERINGUES. 

Beat to a very solid froth the whites of six fresh eggs, and have 
ready to mix with them half a pound of the best sugar, well dried and 
sifted. Lay some squares or long strips of writing-paper closely upon 
a board, which ought to be an inch thick to prevent the meringues from 
receiving any colour from the bottom of the oven. When afi is ready 
for theoH stir the sugar to the beaten eggs, and with a table or dessert- 
spoon lay Uie mixture on the paper in the form of a half egg; sift sugar 
quickly over, blow oflT all that does not adhere, and set the meringues 
immediately into a moderate oven : the process must be expeditious, or 
the sugar melting will cause the meringues to spread, instead if re- 
taining their shape. When they are coloured a liffht brown, and are 
firm to the touch, draw them out, raise them from the paper, and press 
back the insides with a teaspoon, or scoop them out so as to leave space 
enough to admit some whipped cream or preserve, with which they are 
to be filled, when cold, before they are served. Put them again into 
the oven to dry gently, and when they are ready fi>r table &sten them 



864 MODERN COOKBK4 [chap. XZIII. 

together in the shape of a whole egg, and pile them lightly on a napkin 
for the second course. 

Whites of fresh eggs, 6 ; sifted sugar, J lb. 

0&«.— Four ounces of pounded almonds may be mixed with the eggs 
and sugar for these cakes, and any flavour added to them at pleasure. 
If well made, they are remarkably good and elegant in appearance. 
They must be fostened together with a little white of egg. 

THICK, XJOHT OIIfOEIUIREAD. 

Crumble down very small eight ounces of butter into a couple of 
pounds of flour, then add to, and mix thoroughly with them, half a 
pound of good brown sugar, two ounces of powdered ginger, and half 
an ounce of good caraway-seeds; beat gradually to these, first two 
pounds of treacle (molasses), next three well-whisked eggs, and last of 
all half an ounce of carbonate of soda, dissolved in a very small cupful 
of warm water ; stir the whole briskly together, pour the mixture intx> 
very shallow tins, put it immediately into a moderate oven, and bake it 
for an hour and a halC The sdngerbread made thus will be remark- 
abljr light and good. For children, part of the spice and butter may be 
omitted. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; butter, 8 ozs. ; sugar, i lb. ; powdered ginger, 2 lbs. ; 
eggs, 3; carbonate of soda, ^ oz. ; water, very small cupnil : baked 1^ 
hour. 

Obs, — We think that something less than the half ounce of soda 
would be sufficient for this gingerbread, for with the whole quantity it 
rises in the oven to three times its height, and is apt to run over the 
tops of the tins even when they are but half filled with it at first 

GOOD COMHON OINOBRB&EAD. 

Work very smoothly six ounces of fresh butter (or some that has 
been well washed from the salt, and wrung dry in a cloth) into one 
pound of flour, and mix with them thoroughly an ounce of ginger in 
fine powder, four ounces of brown sugar, and half a teaspoonnil of 
beaten cloves and mace. Wet these with three-quarters of a pound, or 
rather more, if needful, of cold treacle ; roll out the paste, cut the cakes 
with a round tin cutter, lay them on a floured or buttered baking tin, 
and put them into a very slow oven. Lemon-grate or candied peel can 
be aaded, when it is liked. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; butter, 6 ozs. ; sugar, \ lb. ; ginger, 1 oz. ; cloves and 
mace, ^ teaspoonfiil ; treacle, j lb. : ^ to | hour. 

RICHER GINGERBREAD. 

Melt together three-quarters of a pound of treacle and half a pound 
of fresh butter, pour these hot on a pound of flo^r mixed with half a 
pound of sugar and three quarters of an ounce of ginger. When the 
paste is quite cold, roll it out with as much flour as will prevent its ad- 
hering to the board : bake the cakes in a very gentle oven. 

COCOA-NUT GINGERBREAD. 

Mix well together ten ounces of fine wheaten flour, and six of 
flour of rice (or rice ground to powder), the grated rind of a lemon, 
and three-quarters of an ounce of ginger ; pour nearly boiling upon 
these a pound of treacle, five ounces of fresh butter and five oTsugar, 



CHAP. XXm.] CAKES. 365 

melted together in a saucepan ; beat the mixture, which w\]\ be almost 
a batter, with a wooden spoon, and when quite smooth leave it till it is 
perfectly cold, then add to it five ounces of grated cocoa-nut, and when 
it is thoroughly blended with the other ingredients, lay the paste in 
small heaps upon a buttered tin, and bake them in a very slack oven 
from half to three^uarters of an hour. 

Flour, 10 ozs.; ground rice, 6 oz&; rind of one lemon; ginger, 4 
oz. ; treacle, 1 lb. ; sugar, 5 ozs. ; butter, 5 ozs. ; cocoa-nut, 5 ozs. : | 
to i hour. 

CHEAP OIN6BR BISCUITS. 

Work into quite small crumbs three ounces of good butter, with two 
pounds of flour, then add three ounces of pounded sugar and two of 
ginger, in fine powder, and knead them into a stifiT paste, with new 
milk. Roll it thin, cut out the biscuits with a cutter, and bake them in 
a slow oven until they are crisp quite through, but keep them of a pale 
colour. A couple of eggs are sometimes mixeMJ with the milk for them, 
but are no material improvement ; an additional ounce of sugar may be 
used when a sweeter biscuit is liked. To make good ginger cakes, 
increase the butter to six ounces, and the sugar to eight, for each pound 
of flour, and wet th^ ingredients into a pasto with eggs : a little lemon- 
grate will give it an agreeable flavour. 

Biscuits : flour, 2 lbs. ; butter, 3 oza ; pounded sugar, 3 ozs. ; ginger, 
2 ozs. 

Cakes : flour, 1 lb. ; butter, 6 ozs. ; sugar, 8 ozs. ; ginger, 1 oz. ; 3 to 
4 eggs ; rind of j lemon. 

A GOOD SODA CAKE. 

Rub half a pound of good butter into a pound of fine dr^ flour, and 
work it very small ; mix well with these half a pound of sifted sugar, 
and pour to them first a quarter of a pint of boiling milk, and next three 
well- whisked eggs; add some grated nutmefif, or fresh lemon-rind, and 
(eight ounces of currants; beat the -whole well and lightly together, and 
the instant before the cake is moulded and set into the oven, stir to it a 
teaspoonful of carbonate of soda in the finest powder. Bake it from an 
hour to an hour and a quarter, or divide it in two, and allow from half 
to three quarters of an hour &r each cake. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; butter, 3 ozs. ; sugar, 8 oza ; milk, full quarter-pint ; 
eggs, 3 ; currants, ^ lb. ; carbonate of soda, 1 teaspoonful ; 1 to 1^ hour. 
Or, divided, ^ to | hour, moderate oven. 

Obs, — ^This, if well made, resembles a pound-cake, but is much more 
wholesome. It is very good with two ounces less of butter, and with 
caraway-seeds or candied orange or citron substituted for the currante. 

CINNAMON, OR LEMON CAKES. 

Rub six ounces of good butter into a pound of fine dry flour, and work 
it lightly into crumte, then add three quarters of a pound of sifted 
susfar, a dessertspoonful of pounded cinnamon (or half as much when 
only a slight flavour is liked), and make these in^edients into a firm 
paste with three eggs, or four, if needed. Roll it, not very thin, and 
cut out the cakes with a tin shape. Bake them in a very gentle oven 
Trom fifteen to twenty minutes, or longer, should they not be done quite 
'through. As soon as they are cold, put them into a clean and dry tin 
canister, a precaution which should be observed with all small sugar

cakoB, which oaght also to he loosened from the oven-tins while tliey are 
still warm. 

Flour, 1 Ih. ; butter, 6 ozs. ; sugar, j lb. ; cinnamon, 1 dessertspoonful 
(more or less, to the taste) ; eggs, 8 to 4. 

Obs, — Lemon cakes can be made by this receipt by substituting for 
the cinnamon the rasped or grated rinds of two lemons, and the strained 
juice of one, when its acidity is not objected to. More butter, and more 
or less of sugar, can be used at will, both for these and for the cinnamon 
cakes. 

QUEEN CAKES. 

To make these, proceed exactly as for Sutherland puddings (see 
Chapter XVIL), but aUow ten eges for the pound of sugar, butter, and 
flour, and when these are all weU mixed, ttirow in half a teaspoonful 
of mace, and a pound of clean dry currants. Bake the cakes in small 
well-buttered tin pans (heart-shaped ones are usual), in a somewhat 
brisk oven, for about twenty minutes. 

A GOOD LIGHT BUN. 

Break quite small three ounces of good butter into a pound and a 
quarter of flour, stir into the middle of Uiese a spoonful and a quarter of 
solid, well-purifled yeast, mixed with something more than a quarter- 
pint of warm milk, and leave it to rise before, but not close to the fire, 
for an hour, or longer, should it not then appear extremely light Add 
to three eggs, properly whisked, a few spoonsful of warm mUk, strain 
and beat them to the bun ; next, mix with it six ounces of pale brown 
sugar, six of well-cleaned currants, and the grated rind of a small lemon, 
or some nutmeg, if preferred; or, in lieu of either, slice into it an ounce 
and a half of candied orange-rind. Let it again rise for an hour, then 
beat it up lightly with a wooden spoon, put it into a buttered pan, and 
bake it in aDrisk oven for nearly or quite an hour. An additional ounce 
of butter will improve it. 

Flour, H lb.; yeast, 1| tablespoonful : 1 hour, or more. Eggs, 3; 
milk, in all not ^ pint ; su^r, 6 ozs. ; currants, 6 ozs. ; lemon-grate, 
nutmeg, or candied orange-nnd, at pleasure : 1 hour. Baked nearly or 
quite an hour ; brisk oven. 

ooooA-Nirr biscuit; (excellent.) 

With a pound of flour mix three ounces of a sound fresh cocoa-nut, 
rasped on a fihe grater; make a leaven as for the bun in the fore^inff 
receipt, with a large tablespoonful of good yeast, and about the third of 
a pint of warm new milk ; let it stand for an hour, then strew over and 
mix well up with it foiu* ounces of pounded sugar ; next, dissolve two 
ounces of butter in a very little milk, cool it down with a few spoonsful 
of cold milk if needful, and pour it to a couple of well-whisked eggs; 
with these wet the other ingredients into a very light dough, let it stand 
from three quarters of an hour to an hour, and bake it about the same 
time in a rather quick oven. Two ounces more of sugar, one of butter, 
and two of candied orange-rind, sliced thin, will convert this into a good 
cake^ the cocoa-nut imparting great richness as well as flavour to the 
mixture: the proportion qf this can also be regulated by the taste, after 
the first trial.

THREADNEEDLB STREET BISCUITS. 

Mix with a couple qf pounds of sifted flour of the very best quality, 
three ounces of good butter, and work it into the smallest possible 
crumbs ; add four ounces of fine, dry, sifted sugar, and make them into 
a firm paste with new milk ; beat this forcibly for some minutes with 
the rolling-pin, and when it is extremely smooth roll it the third of an 
inch thicl^ cut it with a small square cutter, and bake the biscuits in a 
very slow oven until they are crisp to the centre : no part of them should 
remain soft. Haifa teaspoonful of carbonate of soda is said to improve 
them, but we have not put it to the test. Caraway'^eeds can be added 
when liked. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; butter, 3 ozs. ; sugar, 4 ozs. ; new milk, 1 j^int, or more; 
biscuits slowly baked till crisp. 

A GALETTB. 

The galette is a favourite cake in France, and may be made rich, and 
comparatively delicate, or quite common, by using more or less butter 
for it, and by augmenting or diminishing the size. Work lightly three 
quarters of a pound of ^xxl butter into a pound of flour, add a large 
saltspoonful of salt, and make these into a paste with the yolks ofa 
couple of eggs mixed with a small cup of good cream, should it be at 
hand ; if not, with water ; roll this into a complete round, three quar- 
ters of anjnch thick; score it in small diamonds, brush yolk of eg^g over 
the top, and bake the galette for about half an hour in a tolerably brisk 
oven ; it is usually eaten hot, but is served cold also. An ounce of sifted 
sugar is sometimes added to it 

A good galette : flour, 1 lb. ; butter, } lb. ; salt, 1 saltspoonful ; yolks 
of eggs, 2; cream, small cupful: baked i hour. Common galette: 
flour, 2 lbs. ; butter, | to 1 lb. ; no eggs. 

CORNISH HEAVY CAKE. 

Mix with a pound and a half of flour, ten ounces of well-cleaned cur 
rants, and a small teaspoonful of salt ; make these into a smooth paste 
with clotted cream (any which is very thick will do), roll the cake till 
it is an inch and a quarter in depth, and bake it thoroughly in a quick 
oven, after having scored the top. 

Flour, 1J| lb. ; currants, 10 ozs.; salt, small teaspoonful; clotted, or 
very thick cream, j to full pint : 35 to 45 minutes, brisk oven. 

VliEED OR FLEAD CAKES. 

These are very much served as a tea-cake at the tables of the supe- 
rior order of Kentish farmers. For the mode of making them, proceed 
as for flead-crust (see Chapter XVI.) ; cut the cakes small with a round 
cutter, and leave them more than half an inch thick; if well made, they 
will rise much in the oven. Bake them in a moderate but not slow oven. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; flead, li lb. ; butter, 6 ozs. : baked 10 to 15 minutes.

These Iriscaits, which are very simple and wholesome, may be made 
with the same doogh as good white bread, with the addition of from 
half to a whole ounce of butter to the pound kneaded into it after it has 
risen. Break the butter small, spread out the douffh a little, knead it 
in well and equally, and leave it for about half an hour; then roll it a 
quarter of an inch thick; prick it wel] all over; cut out the biscuits; 
and bake them in a moderate oven from ten to fifteen minutes : they 
should be crisp auite through, but not deeply coloured.

into two pounds of flour before the yeast is added. 



CHAPTER XXIV. 
CONFECTIONARY. 

TO CLARIFY SUGAR. 



It is an economy to use at once' the very best sugar for confectionary 
in general, for when highly refined it needs little or no clarifying, even 
for the most delicate purposes; and the coarser kinds lose considerable 
weight in the process. Break it into large lumps, and put it into a very 
elean preserving-pan ; measure for each pound a pint of spring water if 
it be intended for syrup, but less than half that quantity for candying 
or making barley-sugar. Beat first apart (but not to a strong froth}, 
and afterwards with the water, about half the white of an e^g for 
six pounds of sugar, unless it should be very common, when twice as 
much may be used. When they are well mixed, pour them over the 
sugar, and let it stand until it is nearly dissolved ; then stir the whole 
thoroughly, and place it over a gentle fire, but do not disturb it after the 
scum begins to ^ther on the top; let it boil for five minutes, then take 
the pan from the fire, and when it has stood a couple of minutes clear 
off the scum entirely, with a skimmer; set the pan again over the fire, 
and when the sugar begins to boil throw in a little cold water, which 
has been reserved for the purpose from the quantity first measured, and 
repeat the skimming until the syrup is very clear; it may then be 
strained through a muslin, or a thin cloth, and put into a clean pan fo«* 
furtiier boiling. 



CHAP. XXnr. CONFECTIONARY. 369 

For syrup: sugar, 6 Iba ; water, 3 quarts; i white of 1 egg. For 
candying, olc, : sugar, 6 lbs. ; water, 2^ pints : o to 10 minutes. 

TO BOIL SUGAR FROM STRUP TO CANDT, OR TO CARAMEL. 

The technicalities by which confectioners distinguish the difierent 
degrees of sugar-boiling, seem to us calculated rather to puzzle than to 
assist the reader; and we shall, therefore, confine ourselves to such 

Elain English terms as may suffice, we hope, to explain them. After 
aving l»iled a certain time, the length of which will in a measure 
depend upon the quality of the sugar as well a? the quantity of water 
added, it becomes a thin syrup, and it will scarcely form a short thread 
if a drop be pressed between the thumb and finger and they are then 
drawn apart ; from five to ten minutes more of rapid boiling will bring 
it to a thick syrup, and when this degree is reached the thread may be 
drawn fi'om one hand to the other at some length without breaking ; but 
its appearance in dropping from the skimmer will perhaps best denote 
its being at this point, as it hangs in a sort of string as it fall& Afler 
this the sugar will soon begin to whiten, and to form large bubbles in 
the pan, when, if it be intended for barley-sugar, or caramel, some 
lemon-juice or other acid must be added to it, to prevent its graining 
or becoming iugar again ; but if wanted to candy, it must be stirred 
without ceasing, until it rises almost to the top of the pan, in one large 
white mass, when it must be used immediately or ladled out into paper 
cases or on to dishes, with the utmost expedition, as it passes m an 
instant almost firom this state to one in which it forms a sort of powder, 
which will render it necessary to add water, to stir it until dissolved, 
and to reboil it to the proper point For barley-sugar likewise it must 
be constantly stirred, and carefully watched after the lemon-juice is 
added. A small quantity sliould be dropped from time to time into a 
large basin of cold water by those who are inexperienced in the pro- 
cess ; when in falling into this it makes a bubbling noise, and if taken 
out immediately after it snaps clean between the teeth without sticking 
to them, it must be poured out instantly: if wanted for sugar-spinning, 
the pan must be plunged as quickly as possible into a vessel of cold 
water. 

BARLBT-SUOAR. 

Add to three pounds of highly-refined sugar one pint and a quarter 
of spring water, with sufficient white of egg to clarify it in the manner 
directed in the last receipt but one : pour to it, when it begins to whiten 
and to be very thick, a dessertspoonfiil of the strained juice of a fresh 
lemon ; and boil it quickly till it is at the point which we have indi- 
cated above. A few drops of essence of lemon may be added to it, just 
as it is taken from the fire. Pour it on to a marble slab, or on to a 
shallow dish which has been slightly oiled, or rubbed with a morsel of 
fresh butter ; and when it begins to harden at the edges, form it into 
sticks, lozenges, balls, or any other shapes at pleasure. While it is still 
liquid it may be used for various purposes, such as Chantilly baskets, 
palace bonbons, des croques-en-bouches,* cerises au caramel^ &c. : for 
these the vessel containing it must be seV into a pan of water, and it

must again be liquefied with a verj i^entle degree of beat sbould it cool 
too quickly. As it soon dissolves if exposed to damp, it should be pot 
into very dry canisters as soon as it is cold, and these should be kept in 
a dry place.

OINOBR CAMDT. 

Break a poand of highly-refined sugar into lumpsi, put it into a pr&- 
aerving^pan, and pour over it about the third of a pint of spring water: 
let it stand until the sugar is nearly dissolved, then set it over a per- 
fectly clear fire, and boil it until it becomes a thin syrup.' Have r^y 
in a large cup a teaspoonfiil of the very best ginger in powder, mix it 
smoothly and firradually with two or three spoonsfiil of tne syrup, and 
then atir it well into the whole. Watch the mixture carefully, keep it 
■ttrred, and drop it often firom a spoon to ascertain the exact point of 
boiling it has reached. When it begins to fidl in Jlakes, throw in the 
fireshly-grated rind of a very lar^ lemon, or of two small ones^ and 
work the sugar round quickly as it is added. The candy must now be 
stirred constantly until it is done : this will be when it mils in a mass 
fiom the spoon, and does not sink when placed in a small heap on a 
dish. It must be poured, or laded out, as expeditiously as possible when 
ready, or it will fall quite into powder. If this should happen, a little 
water must be added to it, and it must be reboiled to the proper point. 
The candy, if dropped in cakes upon cold dishes, may be moved off 
without difficulty before it is thoroughly cold, but most not be touched 
while quite hot or it will break. 

So^r, highly refined, 1 Ib^ ; water, ^ of a pint; ginger, 1 teaspoon- 
fill ; rind of 1 large lemon. 

OEANOE-FLOWER CAHDT. 

Beat in three quarters of a pint, or rather more, of water, about the 
fourth part of the white of an egg; and pour it on two pounds of the 
best sugar broken into lumps. When it Imis stood a little time, place it 
over a very clear fire, and let it boil for a few minutes, then set it on 
one side, until the scum has subsided ; clear it ofl^ and boil the sugar till 
it is very thick, then strew in by degrees three ounces of the fetaU of 
the orange-blossom, weighed afler they are picked from their 8tem& 
Continue to stir the candy until it rises in one white mass in the pan, 
then pour it into small paper cases, or on to dishes, and follow for it 
precisely the same directions as are given for the ginger-candy in the 
preceding receipt The orange-flowers will turn brown if thrown too 
soon into the syrup : it should he more than three parts boiled when they 
are added. They must be gathered on the day they are wanted foi 
use, as they become soon discoloured from keeping. 

Sugar, 2 lbs.; water, | pint; ^ white of egg; orange-blossoms, 3 ozs. 

ORANOK-FLOWEB CANDT ; (^onotker Receipt.) 

The French, who are very fond of the delicious flavour of the orange- 
blossom, leave the petals in the candy ; but a more delicate confection, 
to English taste, is made as follows : — ^Throw the orange-flowers into 
the syrup when it has boiled about ten minutes, and after they have 
aimmered in it for five more, pour the whole out, and leave them to in-

fuse until the following day, or even longer, if more convenient ; then 
bring the syrup to the point of boiling, strain it from the blossoms 
through a muslin, and finish it 'by the foregoing receipt 

PALACE-BONBONS. 

Take some fine fresh candied orange or lemon-peel, take off the sugar 
that adheres to it, cut it into inch-squares, stick these singly on the 
prong of a silver fork, or on osier-twigs, dip them into liquid barley- 
sugar, and place them on a dish rubbed with the smallest possible quan- 
tity of very pure salad oil. When cold, put them into tin boxes or 
canisters well dried, with paper between each layer. 

EVERTON TOFFIE. 

Put into a brass skillet, if at hand, three ounces of very fresh batter, 
and as soon as it is just melted add a pound of brown suffar of moderate 
quality ; keep these stirred gently over a very clear fire ror about fifteen 
minutes, or until a little of the mixture, dropped into a basin of cold 
water, breaks clean between the teeth without sticking to them : when 
it is boiled to this point, it must be poured out immediately, or it will 
burn. The grated rind of a lemon, added when the toffie is half done, 
improves it much ; or a small teaspoonful of powdered ginger, moistened 
with a little of the other ingredients, as soon as the sugar is dissolved, 
and then stirred to the whole, will vary it pleasantly to many tastes. 
The real Everton tofiie is made, we apprehend, with a much larger 
proportion of butter, but it is the less wholesome on that very account 
if dropped upon dishes first rubbed with a buttered paper, the toffie when 
cold can be raised fix)m them easily. 

Butter, 3 ozs. ; sugar, 1 lb. : 15 to 18 minutes. 

TOFFIE. (another WAT.) 

Boil together a pound of sugar and five ounces 6f butter for twenty 
minutes; then stir m two ounces of almonds blanched, divided, and tho- 
roughly dried in a slow oven, or before the fire. Let the tofiie boil 
after they are added, till it crackles when dropped into cold water, and 
snaps between the teeth witliout sticking. 

Sugar, 1 lb. ; butter, 5 ozs. ; almonds, 2 ozs. : 20 to 30 minutes. 



CHAPTER XXV. 

DESSERT DISHES. 
melange of FRurr. 



Heap a dessert-dish quite high with alternate layers of fine fresh 
strawberries stripped from the stalks, white and red currants, and white 
or red raspberries ; strew each layer plentifully with siftecl sugar, and 
just before the dish is sent to table, pour equally over the top a glass 
and a half of brandy, or, if preferred, the same quantity or rather more 
0f white wine, mixed with the strained juice of one small, or of half a 
large lemon. Currants by themselves are excellent prepared in this 



872 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAF XXY. 

way, and strawberries also. The fruit should be gentlir stirred with a 
spoon when it is served. Each variety must be picked with great 
nicety from the stalks. The brandy would, we think, be less to the 
general taste in this country than the wine. 

FRUIT EN CHEMISE, OR PERLE. 

Select for this dish very fine bunches of red and white currants, large 
ripe cherries, and gooseberries of different colours, and strawberries or 
raspberries very freshly gathered. Beat up the white of an egg with 
about half as much cold water, dip the fruit into this mixture, drain it 
on a sieve for an instant, and then roll it in fine sifted sugar until it is 
covered in every part; give it a gentle shake, and lay it on sheets of 
white paper to dry. In England, thin gum-water is sometimes used, 
we believe, for this dish, instead of the white of egg ; we give, how- 
ever, the French method of preparing it It will dry gradually in a 
warm room, or a sunny window, in the course of three or four hours. 

PEACH SALAD. 

Pare and slice half a dozen fine ripe peaches, arrange them in a dish, 
strew them with pounded sugar, and pour over them two or three glasses 
of champagne: other wine may be used, but this is best Persons who 
prefer brandy can substitute it for wine. The quantity of sugar must 
be proportioned to the sweetness of the &uit 

ORANGE SALAD. 

Take off the outer rinds, and then strip away entirely the white 
inside skin from some fine China oranges; slice them thin, and remove 
the pips as this is done ; strew over them plenty of white sifted sugar, 
and pour on them a glass or more of brandy: when the sugar is dis- 
solved, serve the oranges. In France, ripe pears of superior quality are 
sometimes sliced in with the oranges. Powdered sugar-candy used in- 
stead of sugar, is an improvement in this salad; and the substitution of 
port, sherry, or Madeira for the brandy is often considered so. The first 
may be used without being pared, and a little cuirasseau or any other 
liquor may be added to the brandy ; or this last, when unmixed, may 
be burned after it is poured on the oranges. 

' ooMPdTE OF ORANGES ; (a Hebrew dish,) 

After having pared and stripped the white inner rind fh)m some fine 
oranges, pull them into quarters, arrange them neatly in a dish, and 
just before they are sent to table pour over them some rich syrup, and 

gimish the whole tastefully with preserved, citron cut in thin slices, 
alf a pint of syrup will be sufficient for a large number of oranges; it 
would be improved, we think, if the rind of one pared very thin were 
infused in it for an hour before it is used. This is one of the receipts 
which we have not considered it needful to prove. 

ORANGES WARMED. 

Place them in a Dutch oven at a considerable distance from the fire, 
and keep them constantly turned: they should only be just warmed 
through. Fold them in a napkin when done, and send them immedi- 
ately to table. This mode of treating them is said to improve greatly 
the flavour of die oranges.

NORMAIVDT PI1>PIN8. 

To one pound of the apples, put one quart of water and six ouncen 
of sugar ; let them simmer gently for three hours, or more should they 
not iS perfectly tender. A few strips of fresh lemon-peel and a very 
few cloves are by some persons considered agreeable additions to the 
syrupy. 

Dried Normandy pippins, 1 lb. ; water, 1 quart ; sugar, 6 ozs. : 3 to 
4 hours. 

Obs, — ^These pippins, if stewed with care, will be converted into a 
rich confection : they may be served hot in a border of rice, as a second 
course dish. ^ 

STEWED FRUNEA17X DE TOUSS, OR TOURS DRIED PLUMS. 

These plums, which resemble in form small dried Norfolk biffins, 
make a delicious compete: they are also excellent served dry. In 
France they are stewed till tender in equal parts of water, and of the 
light red wine of the country, with about four ounces of sugar to the 
pound of fruit : when port wine is used for them a smaller proportion 
of it will suffice. The sugar should not be added in stewing any dried 
fruits until they are at least half-done, as they will not sonen by any 
means so easily in synip as in unsweetened liquid. 

Dried plums, 1 lb. ; water, ^ pint, and light claret, ^ pint, or water, 
I pint, and port wine, ^ pint : 1^ hour. Sugar, 4 ozs. : 1 hour, or more. 

Obs. — Common French plums are stewed in the same way with or 
without wine. A little experience will teach the cook the exact quan- 
tity of liquid and of sugar which they require. 

BAKED COMPETE OF APPLES. {Our little lady* 8 receipt,) 

Put into a wide jar, with a cover, two quarts of golden pippins, or 
any small apple which resembles them in appearance, pared and cored, 
but without being divided ; strew amongst them some small strips of 
very thin fresh lemon-rind, and throw on them, nearly at the top, half a 
pound of very good sugar, and set the jar, with the cover tied on, for 
some hours, or for a night, into a very slow oven. The apples will be 
extremely good, if not too quickly baked : they should remain entire, 
but be perfectly tender and clear in appearance. Add a little lemon- 
juice when the season is far advanced. 

Apples, 2 quarts ; rind, quite small lemon ; sugar, ^ lb. : 1 night in 
slow oven ; or some hours baking in a very gentle one. 

Obs, — ^These apples may be served hot or cold for a second oourse 
dish ; or they will answer admirably to fill Gabrielle's pudding, 

TO BAKE PEARS. 

Wipe some large sound iron pears, arrange them on a dish with the 
stalk end upwardi^ put them into the oven after the bread is drawn, and 
let them remain all night If well baked, they will be excellent, very 
sweet, and juicy, and much finer in flavour than those which are 
stewed or baked with sugar : the bon chretien pear also is delicious 
baked thus.

of sngar, in lamps, sjb nrach water as will nearly cover them, and should 
a very bright colour be desired, a dozen grains of cochineal, bruised, 
and tied in a muslin ; stew the fruit as gently as possible, from four to 
six hours, or longer, should it not be very tender. The Chaumontel 
pear, which sometimes &IIs in lar^e quantities before it is ripe, is ex- 
cellent, if first baked until tolerably tender, and then stewed in a thin 
qrrup. 

Make a slight incision in the outer skin only of each chestnut, to 
prevent its bursting, and when all are done, throw them into plenty of 
Doiling water, with about a dessertspoonful of salt to the half gallon. 
Some chestnuts will require to be boiled nearly or quite an hour, others 
little more than half the time ; the cook should tr)r them occasionally, 
and as soon as they are soft through, drain them, wipe them in a coarse 
cloth, and send them to table quickly in a hot napkin. 

BOASTED CHESTNirrS. 

The best mode of preparing these is to roast them, as in Spain, in a 
coflEee-roaster, after having first boiled them from five to seven minutes, 
and wiped them dry. They should not be allowed to cool, and will re* 
quire but firom ten to fifteen minutes roasting. They may, when more 
eoDvenient, be finished over the fire as usual, or in a Dutch or common 
oven, but in all cases the prevbus boiling will be fband an improvement 

Never omit to cut the rind of each nut slightly before it is cooked. 
Serve the chestnuts very hot in a napkin,^ axM send salt to table with 
them.

STRAWBSKRT TITCBOAB, OF D1SLIGIOI7S VIiAVOinU 

Taxb the stalks fi-om the fiuit, which should be of a highly flavoured 
sort, quite ripe, fresh from the beds, and gathered m dry weather; 
weigh anH put it into larp^ glass jars, or wide-necked bottles, and to 
each pound pour about a pmt and a half of fine pale white wine vine- 

far, which will answer the purpose better than the entirely colourless 
ind spld under the name of disUUed vinegar ^ but which is, we believe, 
the pyroligneous acid greatly diluted. Tie a thick paper over them, 
and let the strawberries remain from three to four days ; then pour off 
the vinegar and empty them into a jelly-bag, or suspend them in a cloth 
that all the liquid may drop finm them without pressure ; replace them 
with an equal weight of fi'esh fruit, pour the vine^r upon it, and three 
days afterwards repeat the same process, diminishmg a littie the propor- 
tion of strawberries, of which the flavour ought ultimately to overpower 
that of the vinegar. In from two to four days drain off the liquid very 
closely, and after having strained it through a linen or a flannel bag, 
weigh it, and mix wiui it an equal quantity of highly-refined sugar 
roughly powdered ; when this is nearly dissolved, stir tde t^ftts^ ovor a

very clear fire until it luis boiled five minutes, and skim it thoroughly ,* 
flour it into a delicately clean stone pitcher, or into large china jugs^ 
throw a folded cloth over and let it remain until the morrow ; put it 
into pint or hal^pint bottles, and cork them lightly with new velvet 
corks ; for if these be pressed in tightly at first, the bottles would be 
liabie to burst: in four or five days they may be closely corked, and 
stored in a dry and cool place. Damp destroys the colour and injures 
the fiavour of these fine fruit^vinegars ; of wnich a spoonful or two in 
a glass of water aflS>rds so agreeable a summer beverage, and one 
which, in many cases of illness, is so acceptable to invalids. They 
make also most admirable sauces for common custard, batter, and various 
other simple and sweet light puddings. 

Strawberries (stalked), 4 lbs. ; vinegar, 3 quarts : 3 to 4 days. Vine- 
gar drained and poured on fresh strawberries, 4 lbs. : 3 days. Drained 
again on to fresh fruit, 3 to 4 lbs. : 2 to 4 days. To each pound of the 
vinegar, 1 lb. of highly-refined sugar: boiled 5 minutes. Lightly 
corked, 4 or 5 days. 

065. — Where there is a garden the fruit may be thrown into the 
vinegar as it ripens, within an interval of forty-eight hours, instead of 
being all put to infuse at once, and it must then remain in it a propor- 
tionate time : one or two days in addition to that specified will make 
no di£^rence to the preparation. The enamelled German stewpans are 
the best possible vessels to boil it in ; but it may be simmered in a stone 
jar set into a pan of boiling water when there is nothing q^ore appro- 
priate at hand ; though the syrup does not usually keep so well when 
this last method is adopted. 

Raspberries and strawberries mixed will make a vinegar of very 
pleasant flavour ; black currants also will afiS>rd an exceedingly useful 
syrup of the same kind. 

8TRAWBEERT ACID ROTAIi. 

Dissolve in a quart of spring water two oimces of citric acid, and 
pour it on as many quite ripe and richly-flavoured strawberries, stripped 
from their stalks, as it will just cover; in twenty-four hours drain the 
liquid closely from the fruit, and pour on it as much more ; keep it in a 
cool place, and the next day drain it again entirely from the fruit, and 
boil it gently for three or four minutes, with its weight of very fine 
sugar, which should be dissolved in it before it is placed over the fire. 
It should be boiled, if possible, in an enamelled stewpan. When per- 
fectly cold put it into small dry bottles for use, and store it in a cool 
but not damp place. It is one of the most delicate and deliciously 
flavoured preparations possible, and of beautiful colour. If allowed to 
remain longer than the eight-and-forty hours before it is boiled, a brisk 
fermentation will commence. It must be well secured from the air 
when stored.

from them in four and five, when more convenient After it is drained 
off, turn the fruit into a sieve placed over a deep dish or bowl, as the 
juice will flow slowly from it for many hours ; put fresh raspberries into 
the bottles, and pour the vinegar back upon them ; two or three days

which we have given for the strawberry vinegar. When the fruit is 
scarce, it may be changed twice only, and left a few days longer in the 
vinegar.

Obs. — When the process of sugar-boiling is well understood, it will 
be found an improvement to boil that which is used for raspberry or 
strawberry vinegar to candy height before the liquid is mixed with it; 
ail the scum may then be removed with a couple of minutes simmering, 
and the flavour of the fruit will be more perfectly preserved. For more 
particular directions as to the mode of proceeding, the chapter on con- 
fectionary tnay be consulted.

TO MULL WINE. (^Ati exccUerU French receipt.) 

Boil in a wineglassfnl and a half of water a quarter of an ounce of 
spice (cinnamon, ginger slightly bruised, and cloves), with three ounces 
of fine sugar, until they form a thick syrup, which must not on any 
account be allowed to burn. Pour in a pint of port wine, and stir it 
^ntly until it is on the point of boiling only: it should then be served 
immediately. The addition of a strip or two of orange-rind cut ex- 
tremely thin, gives to this beverage the flavour of- bishop. In France 
light claret takes the place of port wine in making it, and the better 
kinds of vin du pays are very palatable thus prepared.

EXCELLENT PORTABLE LEMONADE. 

Rasp, with a quarter-pound of sugar, the rind of a very fine juicy 
lemon, reduce it to powder, and pour on it the strained juice of the 
fruit Press the mixture into a jar, and when wanted for use dissolve 
a tablespoonful of it in a glass of water. It will keep a considerable

citric acid may be added when it is taken. 

EXCELLENT BARLEY WATER. (PoOT Xurtf$ RecetpL) 

Wipe very clean, by rolling it in a jsofl cloth, two tablespoonsful of 
pearl barley ; put it into a quart jug, with a lump or two of sugar, a 
grain or two of salt, and a strip of lemon-peel, cut thin ; fill up the jug 
with boiling water and keep the mixture gently stirred for some min- 
utes; then cover it down, and let it stand till perfectly cold. In twelve 
hours, or less, it will be fit for use ; but it is better when made over- 
night If these directions be followed, the barley-water will be com- 
paratively clear, and very soft and pleasant to drink. A glass of calf's 
feet jelly added to the barley is an infinite improvement; but as lemon- 
rind is often extremely unpalatable to invalids, their taste should be 
consulted before that ingredient is added, as it should be also for the 
degree of sweetness that is desired. After the barley-water ^s been 
poured ofi^once, the jug may be filled a second time with boiling water, 
and even a third time with advantage. 

RAISIN WINE ; (tchichf if long kept, really resembles foreign.) 

First boil the water which is to be used for the wine, and let it again 
become perfectly cold ; then put into a sound sweet cask eight pounds 
of fine Malaga raisins for each ^llon that is to be used, taking* out only 
the quite large stalks ; the fruit and water may be put in alternately 
until the cask iafuU, the raisins being well pressed down in it; lay the 
bung lightly over, stir the wine every day or two, .and keep it full by 
che addition of water that has, like the first, been boiled, but wbidi 
must always be quite cold when it is used. So soon as the fermentation 
has entirely ceased, which may be in from six to seven weeks, press in 
the bung, and leave tlie wine untouched (or twelve months; draw it off 
then into a clean cask, and fine it, if necessary, with isinglass, tied in a

tried ; but we have tasted wine made by it which had been five years 
kept, and which so much resembled a rich foreign wine, that we could 
with -difficulty believe it was home made. 

To each gallon of water (boiled and left till cold) 8 lbs. of fine 
Malaga raisins; to stand twelve months; then to be drawn off and 
fined. 

Obs, — ^Tbe refuse raisins make admirable vinegar if fresh water be 
poured to them, and the cask placed in the sun. March is the best 
time for making thiv wine. 

EXCELLENT ELDERBERRY WINE. 

Strip the berries, which should be fresh, and gathered on a dry day, 
clean from the stalks, and measure them into a tub or large earthen' 
pan. Pour boiling water on them, in the proportion of two gallons to 
three of berries, press them down into the liquor, cover them closely, 
and let them remain until the following day ; then strain the juice from 
the fruit through a sieve or cloth, and, when this is done, squeeze from 
the berries the greater part of the remaining juice, mix it with that 
which was first poured ofi^ measure the whole, add to it three pounds 
of sugar, three quarters of an ounce of cloves, and one ounce of ginger, 
for eveiy gallon, and boil it twenty minutes, keeping it thoroughly 
skimmed. Put it, when something more than milk-warm, into a per- 
fectly dry and sweet cask (or if but a very small quantity of wine be 
made, into large stone bottles, which answer the purpose quite well), 
fill this entirely, and set the wine directly, with a large spoonful of new 
yeast dropped into ttie bung-hole, and just stirred round in the liquor, or 
with a small toasted crust thickly spr^ with yeast* 

VERY GOOD OINOER WINE. 

Boil together, for half an hour, fourteen quarts of water, twelve 
pounds of sugar, a quarter of a pound of the best ginger bruised, and 
the thin rinds of six large lemons. Put the whole, when milk-warm, into 
a clean dry cask, with the juice of the lemons, and half a pound of sun 
raisins ; add one large spoonful of thick yeast, and stir the wine every 
day for ten day& When it has ceased to ferment, add an ounce of isin- 
glass, and a pint of brandy ; bung the wine close, and in two months it 
will be fit to bottle, but must remain longer in the cask should it be too 
sweet When it can be obtained, substitute for the water in this 
receipt cider freeh firom the press, which will givQ a very superior 
wine. 

Water, 14 quarts; sugar, 12 pounds; lemon-rinds, 6; ginger, i lb.;

1 oz. ; brandy, 1 pint 

EXCELLENT^ ORANOE WINE. 

Take half a chest of Seville oranges, pare off the rinds as thin as 
possible, put two thirds of them into six gallons of water, and let them 
remain for twenty-four hours. Squeeze the oranges (which ought to 
yield seven or eight quarts of juice) through a sieve into a pan, and as 
they are done throw them into six gaUons more of water; let them

W WMh«)d well in it with the hands, and then put into another six gal- 
lons of water and left till the following day. For each gallon of wine, 
pat into the cask three pounds and a quarter of loaf sugar, and the 
liquor strained clear from the rinds and pulp. Wash these again and 
•fain, should more liquw be required to nil the cask ; but do not at any 
time add raw water. Stir the wine daily until the sugar is perfectly 
dissolved, and let it ferment from four to five weeks; add to it two 
bottlee of brandy, stop it down, and in twelve months it will be fit to 
botUe. 

Obs. — ^The excellence of all wine depends so much upon the fermen- 
tation being properly conducted, that unless the mode of regulatifi|[ 
this be understood hj the maker, there will always be ffreat dai^^«

TO ROAST COFFEE. 

Persons who drink cofiee habitually, and who are particular aboat 
\f, * its flavour and quality, should purchase the best kind in a raw state, 

■; and have it roasted at home. This can be done in very small quanti- 

ties by means of the inexpensive apparatus shown above ; and the sup- 
ply of charcoal needed for it being very trifling indeed. The, cylinder 
which contains the cofiee should be only half filled, and it should be 
turned rather slowly over the fire, which should never be fierce, until 
a strong aromatic smell is emitted; the movement should then be 
quickened, as the grain is in that case quite heated, and it will become 
too highly coloured before it is roasted through, if slowly finished. 
When it is of a fine, light, equal brown, which must be ascertained, 
until some little experience has been acquired, by sliding back the 
door of the cylinder, arid looking at it occasionally towards the end of 
the process, spread it quickly upon a lar^e dish, and throw a folded 
cloth over it. Let it remain thus until it is quite cold, then put it into 
canisters or bottles, and exclude the air carefiilly fi:t)m it Mr. Web- 
ster, in his admirable Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy,*-8ays, " Mr. 
Donovan recommends that, instead of roasting the cofiee in an atmo- 
sphere of its own steam, it should first be dried in an iron pan, over a 
very gentle fire, being constantly stirred until the colour becomes yel- 
low ; it is then to be pounded into coarse fragments, bv no means too 
fine, each grain being divided into four or five parts only : it is then to 
be transferred to the roaster, and scorched to the proper degree.** This 
plan we have not tried, because we have found the other to answer

TO MAKB COSTKBa 

It is more usual at the present day to filter than to boil coffee, bat 
many persons stUl pref^ the lattor mode. The degree of strength 
which 18 to be given must of course depend on the taste of those lor 
whom It is prepared ; but it should always be good when served to 
strangers, as a preference ibr weak coffee is very rare, and in a vast 
many instances it would be peculiariy disagreeable to the drinkers, 
more especially so to those who have resided much abroad, where this 
beverage is in general much better prepared than it is here. 

An ounce of the berries, if recently roasted, and ground at the in- 
ftant of using them, will make, with the addition of a pint of water, 

two breakfast-cupsful of suffi- 
ciently good cofiee for com- 
mon family use. It will be 
stronger if slowly filtered in 
what is called a percolator, or 
co^e-biggin, than if it be 
boiled. Press the powder close- 
ly down, measure the proper 
quantity of water into a com- 
mon cofi^pot, or small ket- 
tle, pour in sufficient to just 
wet the coffee in the first in- 
stance, and then add the re- 
mainder slowly, keeping the 
water boiling all the time.

Increased or diminished at will To make French breakfast-cofifee, 
pour only a third as much of water on the powder, fill the cups two- 
thirds with good new boiling milk, tlien add the coffee, which should be 
very strong. For the cqfe noir served afler dinner in all French fami- 
lies put less water still (this is the very essence of oofi!ee, of which, 
however, not more than a small cup about two-thirds filled, and highly 
sweetened with sugar in lumps, is generally taken by each person), and 
serve it without cream or milk, or anv accompaniment, except white 
sugar-candy in powder, or highly refined sugar in lumps. This is drunk 
immediately after the dinner, in ^milies of moderate rank, generally 
be&re they leave the table; in more refined life, it is served in the 
drawing-room the instant dinner is ended ; sometimes with liquors afler 
it, but not invariably. 

To boil coffee and refine it : put the necessary quantity of water into 
a pot which it will not fill by some inches ; when it boils, stir in the

CHAPTER XXVHL 
BREAD. 

TO PIJRIIT TSA8T FOR BREAD OR CAKB8. 

The yeast procured from a public brewery is oflen so extremely bit- 
ter that it can only be rendered fit for use by frequent washings, and 
after these even it should be cautiously employed. Mix it, when first 
brought in, with a large quantity of cold water, and set it by until the 
following morninff in a cool place ; then drain off the water, and stir 
the yeast up well with as much more of fresh ; it most again stand 
several hours before the water can be poured clear frtHn it By changing 
this daily in winter, and both night and morning in very hot weaUier, 
the yeast may be preserved fit for use much longer than it would other- 
wise be ; and should it ferment rather less freely after a time, a smaU 
portion of brown sugar stirred to it before the bread is made will quite 
restore its strength. 

German yeast, imported in a solid state, is now much sold in London, 
and answers, we are told, remarkably well ; but we have not ourselves 
had an opportunity of proving it 

THE OVEN. 

A brick oven, heated with wood, is &r superior to any other for baking 
bread, as well as for most other purposes, the heat of an iron one being 
much less easy to regulate ; but those attached to the kitchen ranges 
are convenient, for £e facility they a^rd at all times of baking in a 
small wav. They are, however, we should say, far from economical as 
regards the proportion of fuel required to heat them ; and the same ob- 
jection may be made to the American oven also ; the strong smell, too^ 
emitted from the iron ones, and diffused often entirely through a houset 
is peculiarly unpleasant. A brick oven should be well heated with fti^- 
got wood, or with a faggot, and two or three solid logs ; and after it is 
cleared, the door should be closely shut for quite half an hour before the 
baking commences ; the heat will then be well sustained for a succes- 
sion of bread, pies, cakes, and small pastry. The servant who habitually 
attends at an oven will soon become acquainted with the precise quan- 
tity of fuel which it requires, and all other peculiarities which may be 
connected with it. In general more time must be allowed to bake any 
thing in an iron than in a brick oven. 

TO MAES BREAD. 

Everv cook, and we might almost say, every tooman, ought to be 
perfectly acquainted with the mode of making good household bread ; 
and skill in preparing other articles of food is poor compensation for 
ignorance upon thi^ one essential point A very slight degree of atten- 
tion, moreover, will enable any person to succeed m it, and there is, 
consequently, small excuse for those who neglect to render themselves 
properly acquainted with the process. 

The best flour will generally be found the cheapest in the end ; it 
should be purchased if possible from a miller who can be depended on 
for supplying it good and unadulterated. Let it be stored always in a 



*CHAP. XXVin.] BRSAD. 865 

dry place, as damp is very injurious to it; if kept habitually in a chesti 
this should be entirely emptied at intervals, cleaned with great nicetv« 
and not filled again until it is perfectly dry. The kneading trough iVM, 
or pan, with every thing else indeed used for the bread, or for the oveoy 
should at all times be kept scrupulously clean. 

The yeast of mild home-brewed beer is the best that can be procuredi 
and requires no purifying ; but it should be strained through a hair- 
sieve after it is mixed wi£ a portion of warm milk, or water, before it 
is added to the flour. 

Very rapid fermentation, which is produced by using more than the 
necessary quantity of yeast, is by no means advantageous to the bread, 
which not only becomes dry and stale from it, but is of less sweet and 
pleasant flavour than that which is more slowly fermented. In winter 
It should always be placed near the fire, but never sufficiently so to be- 
come hot ; nor should it ever be allowed to become perfectly cold. Put 
half a bushel (more or less, according to the consumption of the family) 
of flour into the kneading tub or trough, and holiow it well in the mid- 
dle ; dilute a pint of yeast as it is brought from the brewery, or half 
the quantity if it has been washed and rendered solid, with four quarts 
>r more of lukewarm milk or water, or a mixture of the two ; stur into 
it, from the surrounding part, with a wooden spoon, as much flour as 
will make a thick batter; throw a little over it, and leave this, which is 
called the leaven, to rise before proceeding further. In about an hour 
it will have swollen considerably, and have burst through the coating 
of flour on the top ; then pour in as much more warm liquid as wiS 
convert the whole, with good kneading, and this should not be spared, 
into a firm dough, of which the surface should be entirely free from 
lumps or crumba Throw a cloth over, and let it remain until it has 
risen very much a second time, which will be in an hour, or something 
ihore, if the batch be large. Then work it lightly up, and mould it 
into loaves of from two to three pounds weight ; send them directly to 
a well-heated oven, and bake them from an hour and a half to an hour 
and three quarters.

BORDYKB BRisAD. (^AtUfior's Receipt.) 

Mix with a gallon of flour a large teaspoonful of fine salt, make a 
hollow in the centre, and pour in two tablespoonsful of solid, well- 
purified yeast, gradually diluted with about two pints and a half of 
milk, and work it into a thick batter with the surrounding flour ; dust 
a little on the top, and leave it to rise from an hour to an hour and a 
half; then knead it up with as ranch more warm skimmed milk as wUl 
render it quite^firra and smooth without being very stiff; let it rise an- 
other hour, and divide it into three loaves ; put them into square tins 
slightly buttered, or into round baking pans, and bake them about an 
hour and a quarter in a well-heated oven. The dough can be formed 
into household loaves if preferred, and sent to the oven in the usual 
way. When a finer and more spongy kind of bread is required for 
immediate eating, substitute new milk for skimmed, dissolve in it about 
an ounce of butter, leave it more liquid when the sponge is set, and let

the whole be lightly kneaded into a lithe dough ; the bread then made 
will be excellent when new, and for a day or so after it is baked, but it 
will become dry sooner than the other. 

Flour, 1 gallon; salt, 1 teaspoonfnl; skimmed milk, 2) pints: to rise 
from 1 to 1^ hour. Additional milk, 1 to2 pints: to rise 1 hour, d 
loaves, baked 1| hour. 

06#. 1. — A few spoonsful of cream will wonderfully improve either 
of the above receipts, and sweet butter-milk substituted R>r the other 
will give to the bread the shortness of a cake ; we would particularly 
tecommend it for trial when it can be procured. 

Obs, 2. — ^For an invalid, especially when the digestion is impaired, 
butter should be altogether omitted from the bread ; and eggs, which 
are oflen added to the finer sorts of rolls, are better avoided alsa 

Obi. 3. — We must repeat our caution against milk or water of n 
ncalding heat being ever mixed with the yeast: it should be warm, 
rather more so than when taken from the cow, but not much. 

BROWIf BREAD. 

Make this by any of the foregoing receipts, with aHeal, as it is called 
(that is to say, the wheat just as it is ground, either separated firom the 
«oaiBe bran or not, according to the quality of the bread requhred), 
instead of flour. It ferments easily, and does not, therefore, require a 
urery full proportion of yeast ; and it absorbs more moisture than the 
-flour ; it also retains it longer, if properly baked. The loaves shouM be 
meU soaked in the oven, but not over-dried. 

O^.— The best bread we ever tasted was made in great part with 
orye-flour: this was in a provincial town in France. 

POTATO BREAD. 

One pound of good mealy potatoes, steamed or boiled very dry, in the 
ordinary way, or prepared by Captain Kater*s receipt (see Chapter 
-XV.), and rubbed quite hot, through a coarse sieve, into a couple of 
pounds of flour, with which they should be well mixed, will produce 
excellent bread, which will remain moist much longer than wheaten 
.bread made as usual. The yeast should be added immediately after the 
potatoes. An ounce or two of butter, an egg^ and some new milk, will 
convert this bread into very superior rolls. 

[dyspepsia bread. 

This bread is now beet known as "Graham bread"— not that Doctor 
Graham invented or discovered the manner of its preparation, but that 
he has been unwearied and successfol in recommending it to the public. 
It is an excellent article of diet fcnr the dyspeptic and the costive ; and 
for most persons of sedentary habits would be beneficial. It agrees 
well with children ; and, in short, I think it should be used in every 
'fkihily, though not to the exclusion of fine bread. The most difficult 
point in manu&cturing this bread, is to obtain good pure meal. It is 
said that much of the bread commonly sold as dyspepsia, is made of the 
hran or middlings, from which the fine flour has been separated ; and 
that snvhdust is sometimes mixed with the meal. To be certain that it 
Is good, send good, clean wheat to the mill, have it ground rather 
«)aMely, and keep the meal in a dry, cocA place. Befbre usmg it, sift 



CHAP. ZXVni.3 BBXAD. 36T 

it through a oommon hair-flieve ; this will separate the very coarse and 
harsh particles. 

Take six quarts of this wheat meal, one tea-cup of good yeast, and 
a half a tea-cup of molasses, mix these with a pint of milk- warm water 
and tea-«poonful of pearlash or salieratua Make a hole in the flour, 
and stir this mixture in the middle of the meal till it is like hatter. 
Then proceed as with fine flour bread. Make the dough when suffi- 
eienUy light into four loaves, which will weigh two pounds per loaf 
when baked. It requures a hotter oven than mie flour bread, and must 
bake about an hour and a hal£ 

BTE AND INDIAN BREAD. 

This is a sweet and nourishing diet, and generally acceptable to 
children. 

^ It is economical, and when wheat is scarce, is a pretty good substitute 
for dyspepsia bread. 

There are many difierent proportions of mixing it — some put one- 
third Indian meal with two of rye; others like one*third rye and two 
of Indian ; others prefer it half and half. 

If you use the largest proportion of rye meal, make your dough stiflj 
80 that it will mould into loaves ;~-when it is two-thirds Indian, it should 
be softer, and baked in deep earthen or tin paos after the following 
rules. 

Take four quarlM of sifted Indian meal ; put it into a glazed earthen 
pan, sprinkle over it a taUespoonftil of fine salt ; pour over it about two 
quarts of boiling water, stir and work it till every part of tbe meal is 
thoroughly wet ; indian meal absorbs a great quantity ci water. When 
it is a1x>ut milk-warm, work in two quarts of rye mealy half a pint of 
lively yeast, mixed with a pint of warm water ; add more warm water 
if needed. Work the mixture well with your hands : it should be stif^ 
but not firm as flour dough. Have ready a large, deep, well-buttere^ 
pan ; put in the dough, and smooth the top by putting your hand in 
warm water, and then patting down the loaf. Set this to rise in a 
warm place in the winter ; in the summer it should not be put by the 
fire. When it begins to crack on the top, which will usually be in 
about an hour or an hour and a half^ put it into a well-heated oven, and 
bake it three or four hours. It is better to let it stand in the oven all 
night, unless the weather is warm. Indian , meal requires to be well 
cooked. The loaf will weigh between seven and eight pounds. Pan- 
hread keeps best in large loaves. 

Many use milk^ in mixing bread ; — in the country, where milk i^ 
plentiful, it is a good practice, as bread is certainly richer wet with 
sweet milk than with water ; but it will not keep so long in warm 
weather. 

Baking can very well be done in a stove ; during the winter this 19 
an economical way of cooking — but the stove must be carefully watchedj 
or there is danger of scorching the bread.]

half to three quarters of an hour longer, mould it into small rolls, brash 
them with beaten yolk of egg, and Msb them from twenty minutes to 
half an hoar. The addition of six ounces o( good sugar, three of but- 
ter, half a pound or more of currants, the grat^ rind of a large lemon, 
and a couple of ounces of candied orange-rind, will convert these into 
excellent buns. When the flavour of Uie saflOron is not liked, oo/^it it 
altogether. Only so much should be used at any time as will give a 
rich colour to the bread. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; butter, 3 ozs. ; solid yeast 1 large tablespoonful (saffiron, 
1 teaspoonful; water, less than a quarter-pint); new milk, 1 pint: 1 
hour, or more. 2 eggs, more milk : j hour : baked 20 to 30 minutes. 

BUBKS. 

Break very small, six ounces of butter into a couple of pounds of fine 
dry flour, and mix them into a lithe paste, with two tablespoonslul of 
mild beer-yeast, three well-beaten eggs, and nearly half a pint of warm 
new milL When it has risen to its full height knead it smooth, and 
make it into very small loaves or thick cakes, cut with a round cake- 
cutter ; place them on a floured tin, and let them stand in a warm place, 
to prove, from ten to twenty minutes before they are set into the oven. 
Bake them about a quarter of an hour; divide them while they are still 
warm, and put tliem into a very slow oven to dry. When they are crisp 
quite through, they are done. Four teaspoonsfiil of sifl»d sugar mast 
be added when sweetened rusks are preferred. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; butter, 6 ozs. ; yeast, 2 tablespoonsful ; eggs, 3; new 
milk* nearly half a pint ; baked \ hour. 

CRUSTS TO SERYB WITH CHEESE. 

Take a half-baked loaf from the oven, and tear it into small rough 
bits with a couple of forks ; lay these on a tin, and put them back into 
the oven for ten minutes. If a light loaf be made fer the purpose, with 
a couple of ounces of butter and new milk, they will quite resemble 
rusks. 

GOOD captains' BISCUITS. 

Make some fine white flour into a smooth paste with new milk; 
divide it into small balls; roll, and afterwards pull them with the 
fingers as thin as possible ; prick them all over, and bake them in a 
somewhat brisk oven from eight to twelve minutes. Thin cream may 
be used for them on occasion, instead of milk, or a morsel of butter may 
be worked into the flour; but they are very good without this last. 

[breakfast BATTER-CAKES. 

Take one pint of milk, three eggs, a piec€ of butter as lar^e as an 
^gSi two spoonsful of yeast, and flour enough to make a stiflT batter ; bake 
them in tui hoops or on a griddle, let them stand and rise all night, but 
not in a very warm place. 

TEA CAKES. 

Rub into a pound of flour, an ounce of butter, a beaten egg, and half 
a teaspoonful of salt; wet it with wiurmed milk; make the paste rather 
StiflT, and let it remain before the fire, where it will be kept warm for an 
hour or two; then roll it thin and cut it with the top of a tumbler; bake 
it quicK. 



CHAP. ZXT2U«3 BREAD CAEE8, &C* 

MUVFim. 

Muffins are baked on a hot iron plate, and not in an oven. To s 
quarter of a peck of flour add three-quarters of a pint of yeast, four 
ounces of salt, and as much water (or milk) slightly warmed, as is suffi- 
cient to form a dough of rather a soft consistency. Small portions of 
the dough are then put into holes, previously made in a layer of flour 
about two inches thick, placed on a board, and the whole is covered up 
in a blanket, and suffered to stand near a fire, to cause the dough to rise ; 
when this is effected, they will each exhibit a semi-globular shape; 
they are then placed on a heated iron plate, and baked; when the bot- 
toms of the muffins begin to acquire a brownish colour, they are turned, 
and baked on the opposite side. 

WHEAT MUFFINS. 

Melt a small piece of butter into a quart of milk, and set it aside 
until cold — ^beat four eggs very liffht, and make a batter, by adding 
alternately and very gradually a little milk and a little flour,- until the 
batter is of the proper consistence, which is quite thin — then add a 
large spoonful of ju^ast, if you do not use the powders. Bake them 
in muffin-rings on a griddle, and butter them before serving — ^they must 
be torn asunder to butter, as cutting them open renders them heavy. 

RICE MUFFINS. 

Rice muffins are made in the same manner exactly as rice cakes, 
except that the batter of the former is thinner — that is, to a quart of 
milk and three eggs, you put less rice and less flour. 

RICE CAKES. 

Boil half a pint of rice until quite soft, setting it aside until perfectly 
cool ; beat three eggs very light and put them with a pint of wheat flour 
to the rice, making it into a batter with a quart of milk ; beat it well, 
and set it to rise with a spoonful of yeast, or use the yeast powders as 
directed in a note at the foot of this page. Bake on a griddle, and but* 
ter them before sending them to table. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

To a quart of buckwheat meal put a little Indian meal (say a table- 
spoonful) and a little salt; make them into a batter with cold water, 
taking care to beat it very well, as the excellence of buckwheat cakes 
depends very much on their being well beaten ; then put in a large 
spoonful of good yeast,* and set to rise; when sufficientiy risen, bake 
them a clear brown on a griddle. They are usually buttered before 
being sent to table. 

FLANNEL CAKES. 

Melt a table-spoonful of butter in a quart of milk, and afler stirring it 

* Many persons now make use of the yeast powders, and give tbc;m a deeided pr&. 
ference. They certainly possess the advantage of requiring less time, and therefagr 
enabling you to make muffins, buckwheat cakes, &«.— which, set with yeast, require 
some hours in the preparation— at a quarter of an hour's notice. Tlie ingredients are 
the super-carbonate of soda and tartaric acid, to he used in the following manner :•«• 
A spoonful of soda, and a spoon two thirds full of tartaric acid, are to be dissolved 
aeparately in a little water. The soda is to be put into the batter when it is partly 
beaten, taking eare that it is ptrftetly dissolved ; and the acid is to be added when tht 
cook is ready to begin baking, as they must not he allowed to stand aft ?i the efie'>

well, set it away to cool ; then beat fimr em very light, and stir them 
into the milk in tarn with half a pound of siiled flour; put in a spoon- 
ful of yeast, and set it aside. These are baked on a griddle like buck- 
wheat cakes, and are always buttered before being sent to table. 

TEAST. 

It is impossible to have good light bread, unless you have lively, 
sweet yeast. When common fiimily beer is well brewed and kept in a 
clean cask, the settlings are the best of yeast If you do not keep beer, 
then make common yeast by the following method. 

Take two quarts of water, one handful of hops, two of wheat bran ; 
boil these together twenty minutes; strain off the water, and while it 
is boilinff hot, stir in either wheat or rye flour, till it becomes a thick 
batter ; let it stand till it is about blood warm ; then add a half pint of 
good smart yeast and a lar^e spoonflil of molasses, if you have it, and 
stir the whole well. Set it m a cool place in summer and a warm one 
in winter. When it becomes perfectly light, it is fit for use. If not 
needed immediately, it should, when it becomes cold, be put in a clean 
jug or bottle ; do not fill the vessel, and the cork must be left loose till 
the next morning, when the yeast will have done working. Then cork 
it tightly, and set in a cool place in the cellar. It will keep ten or 
twelve days. 

MILK TEA8T. 

Take one pint of new milk ; one teaspoonful of fine salt, and a large 
spoon of flour— stir these well together; set the mixture by the fire, 
and keep it just lukewarm ; it will be fit for use in an hour. Twice the 
quantity of common yeast is necessary ; it will not keep long. Bread 
made of this yeast dries very soon ; but in the summer it is sometimes 
convenient to make this kind when yeast is needed suddenly. -^ 

Never keep yeast in a tin vessel. If you find the old yeast souTf 
and have not time to prepare new, put in salsratus, a teaspoonful to a 
pint of yeast, when ready to use it If it foams up lively, it will raise 
the bread ; if it does not, never use it 

HARD TSA8T. 

Boil three ounces of hops in six quarts of water, till only two quarts 
remain. Strain it, and stir in while it is boilingr hot, wheat or rye 
meal till it is thick as batter. When it is about mflk-warm add half a 
pint of good yeast, and let it stand till it is very light, which will pro- 
bably be about three hours. Then work in sifted Indian meal till it is 
stiff* dough. Roll it out on a board ; cut it in oblong cakes about three 
inches by twa They should be about half an inch thick. Lay these 
cakes on a smooth board, over which a Tittle flour has been dusted ; 
prick them with a fork, and set the board in a dry clean chamber or 
store-room, where the sun and air may be freely admitted. Turn them 
every day. They will dry in a fortnight unless the weather is damp. 
When the cakes are fully dry, put them into a coarse cotton bag ; hang 
it up in a cool, dry place. If rightly prepared these cakes will keep a 
year, and save the trouble of making new yeast every week. 

Two cakes will make yeast sufficient for a peck of flour. Break 
them into a pint of lukewarm water and stir in a large sjioonful of floor.

the evening before yon bake. Set the mixture where it can be kept 
moderately warm. In the morning it will be fit for use. 

FOTATOE TEAST 

Is made of mealy potatoes boiled thoroughly soft — they are then skin- 
ned and mashed as smooth as possible, when as much hot water should 
be put on them as will make a mash of the consistency of good beer 
yeast. Add to every pound of potatoes two ounces of treacle, and when 
just warm stir in for every pound of potatoes two large spoonsful of 
yeast. • Keep it warm till it has done fermenting, and in twenty-four 
nours it will be fit for use. A pound of potatoes will make nearly a 
quart of yeast, and it is said to be equally as good as brewers' yeast 

The following is Dr, LettsonCs directions for making" another 

Prepared Yeast, 

Thicken two quarts of water with four ounces of flour, boil it for 
half an hour, then sweeten it with three of brown sugar ; when almost 
cold, pour it along with four spoonsful of bakers' yeast into an earthen 
jug, deep enough for tlie fermentation to go on without running over; 
place it for a day near the fire ; then pour off the thin liquor from the 
top, shake the remainder, and close it up for use, first straining ii 
through a sieve. To preserve it sweet, sef it in a cool cellar, or hang 
it some depth in a well. Always keep some of this yeast to make the 
next quantity that is wanted.] 



[CHAPTER XXIX. 



AMERICAN MODE OF COOKING INDIAN CORN, PUMP- 

KINS, &c. 

Maize or Indian com has never been extensively used in Great Bri- 
tain, and the editor has every reason to believe that this has arisen from 
the almost total ignorance of the English people as to the mode of pre- 
paring it for human food. It is, perhaps, the most productive crop that 
can be grown, and its nutritious qualities, when properly prepared, are 
equal to its productiveness. We are satisfied that it may be growu in 
that country, or, at any rate, in the south and eastern parts of it, with 
great advantage ; indeed, the experiment has been tried, and with de* 
cided success. The late Mr. Cobbett grew an average crop of the dwarf 
kind on Barn Elms &rm, Surrey, for three or four years. 

INDIAN CAKE, OR BANNOCK. 

This, as prepared in our own country, is cheap and very nice food. 
Take one quart of Indian meal, dressed or sifted, two tablespoonsful of 
treacle or molasses, two teaspoonsful of salt, a bit of" shortening*' (but- 
ter or lard) half as big as a hen's eggy stirred together ; make it pretty 
moist with scalding water, put it into a well-greased pan, smooth over 
the surface with a spoon, and bake it brown on both sides before a quick 
fire. A little stewed pumpkin, scalded with the meal, improves til 
cuke. Rinnock split and dipped in butter makes very nice toast

Tbifl is a moet delicious vegetable. When used as a vegetable, the 
oo6s, or ears, are plucked about the time that the corn has arrived at a 
milky state, or just before it assumes a solid substance. A part of the 
leaves or filaments by which the cob, or ear is surrounded, is taken 
away, and the cobs boiled from twenty to forty minutes, "according to 
its age.'* When it is done, it is served with cold or melted butter, and 
eaten (after bein^ stripped of its remaining leaves) by taking the two 
ends of the cob m the hands, and biting on the corn. The editor can 
bear testimony to its delicious quality. 

nCDIAH OOBN, OB MAIKB PUDDIMG, BAKED. 

Scald a quart of milk (skimmed milk will do), and stir in seven table- 
spoonsful of sifted Indian meal, a teaspoonful of salt, a teacupful of mo- 
lasses or treacle, or coarse moist sugar, and a tablespoonful of powdered 
ginger or sifted cinnamon : bake three or four hours. If whey is wanted, 
pour in a litUe cold milk after it is all mixed. 

BOILBD MAIZB PUDDIltO. 

Stir Indian meal and warm milk together ** pretty stiff;'* a little salt 
and two or three ** great spoonsful** of molasses added ; also a spoonful 
of ginger, or any other spice that may be preferred. Boil it in a tight- 
covered pan, or m a very thick cloth ; if the water gets in, it will ruin 
it Leave plenty of room, for Indian meal swell? very much. The 
milk with which it is mixed should be merely warmed ; if it be scalding 
hot, the pudding will break to pieces. Some chop suet very fine, and 
warm in the mOk ; others warm thin slices of apple to be stirred into 
the pudding. Water will answer instead of milk. 

PUVFEIN AKD SQUASH PIE. 

The usual way of dressing pumpkins in Englaind in a pie is to cut 
them into slices, mixed with apples, and bake them with a top crust 
like ordinary pies. A quite different process is pursued in America, 
and the editor can testify to the immense superiority of the Yankee 
method. In England, the pumpkin is grown for show rather than for 
use ; nevertheless, when prq[>er]y dressed, it is a very delicious vege- 
table, and a imiversal favourite with our New England neighbours. 

The following is the American method of making a pumpkin pier- 
Take out the seeds, and pare the pumpkin or squash ; but in taking out 
the seeds do not scrape the inside of the pumpkin ; the part nearest the 
seed is the sweetest ; then stew the pumpkin, and strain it through a 
sieve or colander. To a quart of milk, for a ftimily pie, three eggs are 
sufficient. Stir in the stewed pumpkin with your milk and beaten-up 
e^gs till it is as thick as you can stir round rapidly and easily. If the 
pie is wanted richer make it thinner, and add another egg or two ; but 
even one egg to a quart of milk makes " very decent pies.'* Sweeten 
with molasses or sugar; add two teaspoonsfufof salt, two tablespoonsful 
of sifted cinnamon, and one of powdered ginger; but allspice may be 
used, or any other spice that may be preferr^. The peel of a lemon 
grated in gives it a pleasant favour. The more eggs, says our Ame- 
rican authority, the better the pie. Some put one egg to a gill of milk. 
Bake about an hour in deep plates, or shallow dishes, without an upper 
crust, in a warm oven. 



/ 



CHAP* ZSIX.1 INDIAN CORN, PUMPKINS, &0. ^108 

There is another method of makingr this pie, which we know from 
experience, |«oduces an excellent dish : Take out the seeds, and grate 
the pumpkin till you come to the outside skin. Sweeten the pulp: 
add a little ground allspice, lemon-peel, and lemon-juice; in short, 
flavour it to your taste. jSake without an upper crust 

CARROT PIE8. 

These pies are made like pumpkin pies. The carrots should he 
hoOed very tender, skinned, and sifted. 

AMERICAN CUSTARD PUDDIlfOS, 

Sufficiently good for common use, may be made by taking five '^ggs 
bf^ten up and mixed with a quart of milk, sweetened with sugar and 
spiced with cinnamon, allspice, or nutmeg. It is well to boil your milk 
first, and let it get cold before using it ** Boiling milk enriches it so 
much, that boiled skim milk is aboat as good as new.** (We doubt this 
assertion ; at any rate, it can only be improved by the evaporation of 
the water.) Bake fifteen or twenty minutes. 

AMERICAN PL17M PUDDING. 

Pound six hard fine biscuits (crackers), soak them for some hours in 
milk sufficient to cover the mass ; add three pints of milk, beat up six 
egfifs, and mix ; flavour with lemon-brandy, and a whole nutmeg grated : 
add three-quarters of a pound of stoned raisins, rubbed in flour. Bake 
not quite two hours. 

AMERICAN APPLE PUDDINGS. 

Take vour apples, and bore out the core without cutting them in 
twa Fill up ^he holes with washed rice. Tie up each apple very 
tight, and separately in the corners of a pudding-bag. Boil an hour, or 
an hour and a half. 

liIRD*8 NB8T PUDDING. 

If you wish to make what is called a bird's nest pudding, prepare 
your custard ; take eight or ten pleasant apples, prepare them and take 
out the core, but leave them whole ; set them in a puddingndish, pour 
your custard over them, and bake about thirty minutes. 

HASTY PUDDING. 

Boil water, a quart, three pints, or two quarts, according to the size 
of your family; sift your meal, stir fkie or six spoonsful of it thoroughly 
into a bowl of water ; when the water in the kettle boils, pour into it 
the contents of the bowl ; stir it well, and let it boil up thick ; put in 
salt to suit your own taste, then stand over the kettle, and sprinkle in 
meal, handnil after handful, stirring it very thoroughly all the time, and 
letting it boil between whiles. When it is so thick that you stir it 
with great difficulty, it is about right It takes half an hours cooking. 
Eat it with milk or molasses. Either Indian meal or rye meal may be 
used. If the system is in a restricted state, nothin? can be better than 
rye hasty pudding and We%i India molasses. This diet would save 
many a one the horrors of dyspepsia.

The author of Domestic Cookery observes, that a very good meal 
may be bestowed on poor people in a thing called brewis, which is thus 
vade : Cut a very thick upper crust of bread, and put it into the pot 
where salt beef is boiling, and nearly ready ; it will attach some of the

Take the good bits of vegetables, and the cold meat left after din-

AMERICAN SOUSE. 

Take pigs* feet, ears, &c. well cleaned, and boil or rather simmer 
them for four or five hours, until they are too tender to be taken out

cold water* After it is packed down tight, boil the jelly-like liquor in 
which it was cooked with an equal quantity of vinegar ; salt as you 
think fit, and add cloves, allspice, and cinnamon. 

PORK AND BEANS 

Is an economical dish ; but it does not agree with weak stomachs. Put 
a quart of beans into two quarts of cold water, and hang Uiem all night 
over the fire, to swell. In the morning pour off the water, rinse them 
well with two or three waters poured over them in a colander. Take 
a pound of pork, that is not very fat, score the rind, then again place 
the beans just covered with water in the kettle and keep them hot 
over the me for an hour or two ; then drain off the water, sprinkle a 
little pepper and a teaspoonful of salt over the beans; place them in a 
well-glazed earthen pot, not very wide at the top, put the pork down in 
the l^ns, till the rmd only appears ; fill the pot with water till it just 
reaches the top of the beans, put it in a brisk oven and bake three of 
four hours. 

Stewed beans and pork are prepared in the same way, onljr they are 
kept oyer the fire, and the pork in them three or four hours instead of 
oeing in the oven. The beans will not be white or pleasant to the tasto 
unless they are well soaked and wished — nor are they healthy without 
this process.]

[DIRECTIONS FOR CARVINO. 

GA&NI8HING, AND SETTIHO OUT A TABL1U. 

In preparing meat for the table, and in laying out the table, refer- 
ence oaght to be had to the carvmg department — a very onerous one 
to all, and to many a very disagreeable one. The carving-knife of 
course ought to be sharp, and if to be nsed by a lady, hi particular, light 
and handy ; dexterity and address in the manner of using it being more 
required than strength, either in the knife or the carver. When a 
lady presides, a seat sufficiently high for her to have a complete ooa»- 
mand over the joints should be provided, and the dish should be suffi- 
ciently deep and capacious, so as not to endanger the splashing of the 
fnvy. It should also be placed as near to the carver as possible, leav- 
in£^ room for his or her plate. A knife with a long blade is required for 
a lar^e fleshy joint; for ham or bacon a middling sized, sharp-pointed 
one IS preferable, and for poultry or game a short knife and sharp- 
pointed is best Some like this knife a little curved. We do not pre- 
sume to give any directions as respects the serving of the guests ; no 
one it is piresuroed would take the head of the table not acquainted with 
the common rules of politeness, which principally consist in endeavour- 
ing to please everybody. 

FISH. 

As fish is the first thin^ to be carved, or served, we shall first speak 
tyf it In helping fish, take care not to break the flakes, which in cod 
and fine fresh salmon, and some other sorts, are large. A fish trowel 
is necessary, not to sa^ indispenkible, in serving many kinds offish, par- 
ticularly the larger sort 

TURBOT, &C. 

The trowel is to be carried flatways from the middle of the fish, and 
the. carver should bring out as much meat as will lie upon it The 
thick part is the best, and of course most esteemed. When one side is 
clearer, the bones ought to be taken away — which done, serve the 
under part The meat on the fins is considered by some a great 
delicacy. Halibuts, plaice, and other large fish, are served in a simi- 
lar way. 

A <XH>'8 HtAD AND SBOmanOLB, 

These, perhaps, require more attention in serving than any other. It 
IS, too, considered a handsome dish. In carving, mtroduce the trowel 
mlong the back, and take off a piece quite down to the bone, taking care 
•not to break the flake& Put in a spoon and take out the sound, a jellv- 
like sid)Stan<^, which lies inside the back-bone. A part of this should 
be served with every slice of fish. The bones «nd glutinous parts of a 
cod's head are much liked by most people, tind are very nourishing. 

SALMON. 

Cut slices along the back-bone, and also along the flank. The flank 
'or thin part is the best and richest, and is preferred byall accomplisned 
goiurmai7d& The back is the most solid and thick. The tail of salmon 



806 /MODKBlff OOOKSBY. [CHAP. 

18 not 80 fine as the other parts. The head is seldom used. The livei', 
melt, and roe, are generally served, but seldom eaten. 

BOLES. 

These are easilyvcarved. You have only to cut through the middle 
part of the fish, bone and all, and subdivide and serve according to the 
size of fish. The thick parts are best ; the roes when well done are 
very nice. 

MACKERKL. 

The trowel should be carried under the meat, horizontally over the 
back-bone, so as to raise one side of the meat from the bone. Remove 
the bone, and serve the other side of the fish. When firesh, well cleaned, 
and well done, the upper end is considered the best. The roes are 
much liked. 

EBL8, WHrriNO JACK, &C. 

These when intended to be fried, are previously cut in pieces of a 
suitable size for serving. When they are boiled, cut through them in 
the same way as soles. Large jacks will admit of slices ^ing taken 
off with a trowel without the bones. Small fish are served whole. 

ATTCH HONE OF BEEF. 

Cut a slice an inch thick all through. Put this by, and serve in 
slices from the remainder. Some persons, however, like outside, and 
others take off a thinner slice befbre serving, for the sake of economy. 
T!ie rich, delicious, soft fat, which resembles marrow, lies at the back 
of the bone : the firm fat is cut in horizontal slices at the edge of the 
meat Some prefer one and some the other. The skewer used to keep 
the meat together when boiling, should be taken out before coming to 
the table, and, if necessary, be replaced by a silver one. 

A ROUND, OR BUTTOCK, AND THICK FUtNK OF BEEF, 

These are carved in horizontal slices, that is, in slices fix>m the top. 
Pare and neatly cut all round. Some prefer the silver side. 

A BRISKKT OF BEEF. 

This is cut lengthways, right down to the bone. The soft mellow 
fiit is found underneath. The upper part is firm, but gristly ; if well 
done, they are equally good to our taste. 

SIRLOIN OF BEEF, 

The glory of the dinner-table, may be commenced carving, either 
by beginning at the end, and cutting slices along the bones, or across 
the middle ; but this latter mode will drain the gravy firom the remain- 
der. The inside is very juicy and tender, but the outside is frequently 
preferred. The inside fat is rich and marrowy, and is considered too 
much so by many. The inside of a sirloin is frequently dressed (in 
various ways) separately. 

FILLET OF VBAIt 

Is the corresponding part to the round in an ox, and is cut in the 
same way. If the outside brown be not desired, serve the next slice. 
Cut deep into the stuffing, and help a thin slice, as likewise of fat. 
A fillet of veal should be cut veiy smooth and thin. 



CHAP. XXZ.] DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 397 

BREAST OF TEAL 

Answers to the brisket of an ox. It should be cracked lengthways, 
across the middle of the bones, to divide the thick gristly part from the 
ribs. There is a great difiereuce in these parts; and as some prefer 
the one, and some the other, the best way is to ask to which the prefer- 
ence is to be given. The burr, or sweetmeat, is much liked, and a part 
should be served with each slice. 

HECKS AND Lonrai 

Of all sorts of meaT^ if properly jointed by the botcher, require 
only to be cut through ; but when the joints are too thick for one, cut 
a slice between each, that is, cut one slice without bone, and another 
with. Some prefer one, and some the other. 

CALF^S HEAD 

ABbrda a great variety of excellent meat, differing in texture and 
flavour, and therefore requires a judicious and skilful carver properly 
to divide it Cut slices longways under the eye, taking care that 
the knife goes close to the bone. The throat sweetbread or kernel, 
lies in the fleshy part, at the neck end, which you should help a slice 
of with the other part The eyes are considered great delicacies bv 
some. They should be taken out with the point of your knife, and eacn 
cut into two. A piece of the palate (which lies under the head), a slice 
of the tongue, with a portion of the brains, should be given to each 
gnest On drawing out the jaw-bone, some delicious lean will be 
found. The heads of oxen, sheep, lambs, &c., are cut in the same way 
as those of calves. 

A LEG OF MUTTON, &.C. 

Begin to cut in the midway, between the knuckle and farther 
end. The slices should be thin and deep. If the outside is not 
fat enough, cut some from the fat on the broad end, in slices. Many 
prefer the knuckle, or venison bit, to the middle part; the latter is 
the most juicy, the former, in ^ood, well-done mutton, is gelatinous, 
and delicately tender. There is some ffood meat on the back <^ 
the leg, or aitch bone ; this should be cut lengthways. It is, however, 
seldom carved when hot To cut out the cramp bone, take hold of the 
shank in your left hand, and steadily cut down to the thieh heme ; then 
pass the knife under the cramp bone. Legs of lamb and pork are cut 
in the same way. 

A SADDLE OR COLLAR OF MUTTON, 

Sometimes called the chine, should be cut lengthways, in long slices, 
beginning close to the backbone, and thus leaving^ the ribs bare. The 
ftt is taken from the outer ends. The inside of the loin is vexy tender; 
and in the opinion of some gourmands, is preferred to the upper part 
It is best, perhaps, to cut the inside lengthways 

SHOULDER OF MUTTON. 

To carve this joint (which when properly dressed is very fine eating) 
economically for a very small family, the best way is to cut away the 
underneath part when hot, and if any more is required, to take it from 
the knuckle. This plan leaves all the gravy in the upper part, which 
k very nice when cold. The usual way, however, of carving a shoulder 

84 



896 MODERN COOKERY. [cBJT. XXX» 

of mutton, is to cut slices deep to the bone, in the hollow part The 
prime part of the fat lies on the outer edge, and is to be cut in thin 
slices. Some good delicate slices of lean may be taken from each siue 
of the ridge of the blade-bone. No slices can be cut across the edge of 
the blade-bone. 

HAUNCH OP YENISOn OR MITrTON. 

Cut down to the bone in circular slices at the narrow end, to let out 
the gravy. You may then turn the broad end of the haunch towards 
you; insert the knife in the middle of .the cut, and cut thin deep slices 
lengthways to the broad end of the haunch. Tlll^ fiit of venison is much 
esteemed ; those who help should take care projuerly to apportion both 
the fiit and gravy. 

FORB-QUARTER OF LAMB. 

Separate the shoulder from the scovel, or breast and ribs, by passing 
the knife under it (the shoulder). The shoulder of grass Iambi which 
is generally pretty large, should have a little lemon or Seville orange- 
juice squeezed over it, and be sprmkled with a little pepper and salt, 
and then placed upon another dish. If the lamb be small, it is usual to 
replace the shoulder. The breast and ribs should be cracked across by 
the batoher, and be divided. Help either from that, the ribs, or 
shoulder, according to choice. 

HAM. 

The roost economical way of cutting a ham, which is seldom or never 
eaten at one meal, is to beg^in to cut at the knuckle end, and proceed 
onwards. The usual way, however, is to begin at the middle, and cut 
in long slices through the thick fat By this means you come at once 
to the prime, but you let out the gravy. Another plan is to cut a small 
hole on the top of the ham, and with a very sharp knife enlarge the 
hole, by cutting thin circular slices. In this latter way you preserve 
the gravy, and of course keep the meat moist to be eaten when cold. 

TONOUB. 

This much-esteemed relish, which often supplies the place of ham, 
should be cut in thui slices across, beginning at the thick middle part 
S^rve slices of ht and kernel from the root 

A 6VCKIMO PIO 

I^ generally slit down the middle in the. kitohen, and the cook 
garnishes the dish with the jaws and ears. Separate a shoulder from 
Oie carcase on one side, and then do the same thing with the leg. 
Divide the ribs, which are frequently considered the most choice part, 
into two or three helpings, presenting an ear or jaw with them as far aa 
they wiU go, and plenty of sauce, ^me persons prefer the leg, because 
not so rich and luscious as the ribs. The neck end between the 
shoulders is also sometimes preferred. The joints may be divided into 
two each, or pieces may be cut from them. 

A FOWL. 

The legs of a boiled fowl are always bent inwards, and tucked 
into the oeWy, but before it is put upon the table, the skewers by 
which they are secured ought to be removed. The fowl should o& 
laid on the carver's plate, and the joints as they are cut off placed on 



CHAP, XXX.] DIHECnONS FOR CARVINO. 399 

the dish. In taking off the wing, the joint only mast be divided- with 
the knife, fpr, by liilin? up the pinion of the wing with the fork, and 
then drawing it towards the legs, the muscles will separate in a much 
better form than you can effect by cutting with a knife. Next plade 
the knife between the leg and body, and ?ut to the bone; turn the leg 
back with the fork, and the joint will give way, if the fowl be young 
and well done. The merrythought is taken out when the legs and 
wings are all removed ; the neck bones are taken off by putting in the 
knife, and pressing it under the long broad part of the bone, then lift 
the neck-bone up and break it off from the part that sticks to the breast 
The breast itself has now to be divided from the carcase, by cutting 
through the tender ribs close to the breast, quite down to the tail ; then 
lay the back upwards, put your knife into the bone half-way from the 
neck to the rump, and on raising the lower end it will readily separate. 
The last thing to be done is to turn the rump from you, and neatly to 
take off the two sidesmen. Each part should be neatly arranged on the 
dish, but it is almost impossible to give effectual written descriptions 
for carving fowls ; the best plan is to observe carefully a good carver, 
and then, by a little practice, you will become perfect The breast and 
tlie wings are considered the best parts. 

A PHEASANT. 

Take out the skewers ; fix your fork in the centre of the breast, slice 
it down ; remove the leg by cutting in the sideway direction, then take 
off the wing, taking care to miss the neck-bone. When the legs and 
wings are all taken ofl; cut off slices of the breast The merrythought 
is separated by passing thei^nife under it towards the neck; ^he other 
parts are cut as before directed in a fowl. The breast, Wiugs, and 
merrythought, are the favourites, particularly the former, but the leg 
has a higher flavour. 

PARTRIDGES AND PIGEONS. 

Partridges are carved like fowls, but the breast and wings are not 
often divided, the bird being small. The wing is the prime bit, par- 
ticularly the tip; the other choice parts are the breast and merry- 
thought Pigeont may be cut in two, eithier from one end to the otlier 
of the bird, or across. 

GOOSE OR DUCK. 

Cut off the apron of the goose and pbur into the body a large spoon- 
ful of gravy, which should l^ mixed with the stuffing. Some persons 
put, instead of the gravy, a glass of port-wine, in which a large tea- 
spoonful of mustard has been previously stirred. Cut as many slices 
from the breast as possible, and serve with a^ portion of the apron to 
each plate. When the breast is all served, and not till then, cut off 
the joints ; but observe, the joints of water-fowl are wider spread and 
go &rther back than those of land-fowl. 

A TURKEY 

Should not be divided till the breast is disposed of; but if it be 
thought proper to divide, the same process must be followed as directed 
in a fowl. The following is the best mode of serving this delicious 
bird : Begin cutting close to the breast-bone, scooping round so as to 
leave the mere pinions. Each slice should carry with it a portion of « 
tiie pudding, or force meat, with which the craw is stufied. 



400 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. 

RARE. 

Put the point of the knife under the shoulder, and cut all the way 
down to the rump, on the side of the back-bone. By doing the same 
CO the other side, the hare will be divided into three parts. The back 
should be cut into four parts : the shoulder must be taken off in a cir- 
cular line. The pieces as they are cut should be neatly placed on the 
dish; in helping, some pudding and gravy should be given to each 
person. The above mode of carving is only applicable to a young 
nare ; when the hare is old, it is not practicable to divide it down, but 
put the knife between the leg and back, and give it a little turn in- 
wards at the joints, which you must endeavour to hit, and then cut, 
and with the fork turn it completely back. When both legs are taken 
oS, you will find a fine coUop on each side of the back, which back you 
may divide into as many pieces as are necessary. Take off the shoul- 
ders, which some persons are very fond of, and which are called the 
sportsman's pieces ; but the leffs and back are considered the prime. 
When all the guests are served, it is usual to take off the head, and by 
putting the knife between the upper and lower jaw, vou may divide 
them; then lay the upper flat upon your plate, put the point of the 
knife into the centre, and cut the head into two ; you will thus get at 
the brains, which may be served with the ears and tail to those who 
like them. Some persons direct the carver to serve with slices, as 
much as possible, off the sides of the back-bone, from the shoalder to 
the rump. 

RABBITS 

Are generally cut up in the same way as hares. The back and legs 
are considered the best parts. The back should be cut into two pieces. 



[GARNISHES. 



Parsley is the most universal garnish to all kinds of cold meat, 
poultry, fish, butter, cheese, and so forth. Horse-radish is the garnish 
for roast beef, and for fish in general ; for the latter, slices of lemon are 
sometimes laid alternately with heaps of horse-radish. 

Slices of lemon for boiled fowl, turkey, and fish, and for roast veal 
and calf ^s head. 

Carrot in slices for boiled beef, hot or cold. 

Barberries fresh or preserved for game. 

Red beet-root sliced for cold meat, boiled beefj and salt fish. 

Fried smelts as garnish for turbot 

Fried sausages or force meat-balls round roast turkey, capon, or fowl 

Lobster coral and parsley round boiled fish. 

Fennel for mackerel and salmon, either fresh or pickled. 

Currant jelly for game, also for custard or bread pudding. 

Seville orange in slices for wild ducks, widgeons, teal and so forth. 

Mint, either with or without parsley, for roast lamb, either hot or cold. 

Pickled gherkins, capers, or onions, for some kinds of boiled meat

CHAP. XXX.] SETTING OUT A TABLE. 401 

SETTING OUT A TABLE. 

A prudent housekeeper, iii providing for a family, or for company, 
will endeavonr to secure variety, and avoid extravagance, taking' care 
not to have two dishes alike, or nearly alike, such as ducks and pork, 
veal and fowls; .and avoiding, when several sorts are required, to have 
such things as cannot he eaten cold, or cannot be warmed or re-cooked. 
There is a great waste occasioi^ if these principles are overlooked in 
providing for a party. When a table is to be set out, it is usual to 
place nearly the whole provisions at once ; but if comfort is tlie object, 
It is better to have each dish and its accompanying sauces and vege- 
tables sent in separately, hot from the kitchen. 

For plain family dinners, soup or pudding is placed at tlie head of 
the table, and meat at the lower end ; vegetables on each side of the 
middle, and sauce boats in the middle. Boiled meat at the top; roast 
meat at bottom ; soup in the middle ; then the vegetables and sauce 
boats at cross corners of the middle ^ish. Poultry or mutton at bottom ; 
boiled poultry at top; roast poultry, or game, at bottom ; vegetables and 
sauces so disposed as to give the appearance of the whole tab]e being 
covered without being crowded. 

When there are several courses, the first consists of soups, stews^ 
boiled fish, fricassees; poultry with ham, bacon, tongue, or chine; and 
roast or boiled meat 

For second course, birds and game of all sorts, fish fried, pickled, or 
potted; pigeon pies, patties, brawn, omelets, oysters steweid or scol- 
loped, and lobsters or crabs. Tarts, cheesecakes, and sweet dishes of 
all kinds, are sometimes placed with the second course, but more fre- 
quently form separate courses by themselves. 

The dessert is usually served in another room, which is a great ac- 
commodation both to the servants^ who can prepare it at leisure, and to 
the guests in quitting the smell of a hot dinner. A d'oyley, a finger- 
glass, two wine-glasses, a China dessert plate, and silver knife and fork, 
and spoon, to each person. Every variety of fruit, fresh and preserved, 
is admissible ; and biscuits, and pound-cake, with an epergne or stand 
of jellies in the middle. Varieties of wine are generally placed at 
each end. 

The modern practice of dining late has added importance to the 
luncheon, and almost annihilated the supper meal. The following are 
suitable for either : soups, sandwiches of ham, tongue, dried sausage, or 
beef; anchovy, toast or husks ; potted beef, lobster, or cheese ; dried 
salmon, lobsters, crayfish, or oysters, poached eggs; patties; pigeon- 
pies ; sausages ; toast with marrow (served on a water-plate), cheese- 
cakes; pufis, mashed or scolloped potatoes, brocoli; asparagus, sea- 
kale with toast, creams, jellies, preserved or dried fruits, salad, radishet, 
&c. If a more substantial supper is required, it may consist of fish, 
poultry, game ; slices of cold meat, pies of chickens, pigeons, or game ; 
lamb or mutton chops, cold poultry, broiled with high seasoning, or 
fricasseed ; rations or toasted cheese.

RELATIVE DUTIES OF MISTRESS AND MAID. 

CiiOKnio 10 neither a mean, nor a simple art To make the best and 
die inoir^ of everything connected with the sustenance of a family, re- 
quires not only industry and experience, but also considerable mental 
capacity, or at any rate, an aptness to learn. 

One of the principal, if not the principal, requisite in a cook, is order 
^4hat fiiculty by which a person is enabled to keep all things in their 
proper places. Without order there can be no cleanliness, another 
indispensable requisite in a cook : to be always cleaning, is not to be 
clean. There are some foolish, fussy women, who, with all the disposi- 
tion on earth to be clean, not having order, dirty one thing as fiist as 
they clean another. Nor is order an essential requisite, as regards the 
cleanliness of a kitchen, and of kitchen utensils only ; in dressing food, 
without oorder there can be no good coeking. 

We have said, that the mistress will take a part in a small fiimily in 
the business o^ cooking. We, perhaps, should have rather said, ought 
to take a part; for we are sorry to say, that there is too much reason to 
believe, that good housewifery is much neglected in the educating of 
young ladies now-a-days. If a mistress be really not acquainted with 
the general principles of cooking, she ought to do one of two things— 
either to make herself acquainted with them as an humble learner, or 
to keep out of the kitchen altogether ; for her ignorant interference 
with a good cook-maid will do no good, but may do a great deal of harm. 
And while on this subject we must give a word of friendly advice to the 
unfortunate cook, who may happen to fall in with an ignorant, irritable 
mistress. Let her take care to refrain from going into a passion with 
her : if the mistress scolds, let the maid be mild ; and above all, let her 
not scold again, or answer in an angry or insulting manner. This is a 
hard thing to do, we are aware, particularly where a servant feels her*^ 
self injured; but if she can do it, she will not only gain the victory 
over her mistress, but she will also feel a. consciousness, a happy con- 
sciousness, of having left undone those things which she ought not to 
have done, and of having done those things which she ouffht to have 
done. But if the tempers and habits of the mistress and maid are 

(4tt) 



APPENDIX. 403 

incompatible to that good understanding which ought always to subsist 
lietween the employer and the employed, the best course for the servant 
to do is, to give notice and leave. Let not this, however, be done in 
anger : before giving warning, let her consult her pillow. 

It has been well oteerved, that it behoves every person to be extremely 
careful whom she takes into her service ; to be very minute in iifVesti- 
gating the character she receives, and equally cautious and scrupulously 
just in giving one to others. Were this attended to, many bad people 
would be incapacitated for doing mischief, by abusing the trust reposed 
in them. It may be fairly asserted, that the robbery, or waste, which 
is but a milder epithet for the unfaithfulness of a servant, will be laid 
to the charge of that master or mistress, who knowing, or having well- 
founded suspicions, of such &ults, is prevailed upon by false pity, or 
entreaty, to slide him, or her, into another place. There are, however, 
some who are unfortunately capricious, and often refuse to give a cha* 
racter, because they are displeased that a servant leaves their service ; 
but this is unpardonable, and an absolute robbery ; servants having no 
inheritance, and depending on their fair name fi>r employment To. 
refuse countenance to the evil, and to encourage the good servant, are 
actions due to society at large; and such as are honest, frugal and 
attentive to their duties, should be liberally rewarded, which would 
encourage merit, and inspire servants with zeal to acquit themselves 
well. 

St^vants should always recollect that everything is provided for them,, 
without care and anxiety on their part They run no risks, are subject 
to no losses, and under these circumstances, honesty, industry, civility,, 
and perseverance, are in the end sure to meet with their reward. 
Servants possessing these qualifications, by the blessing of God, must 
succeed. Servants should be kind and obliging to their lellow-servants; 
but if they are honest themselves, they wul not connive at dishonesty 
in others. They who see crimes committed and do not discover them,, 
are themselves legally and morally guilty. At the same time, however, 
well recollect, that tittle-tattling and tale-bearing, for the sake of get- 
ting in your mistress's good graces, at the expense of your fellow- 
servants, is, to the last degree, detestable. A sensible mistress will 
always discourage such practices. 

We have known servants imagine, that because their employers are 
kind to them, that because they do not command them to do this or that, 
but rather solicit them, that, therefore, they cannot do without them, 
and instead of repaying their good-nature and humanity by gratitude 
and extra attention, give themselves airs, and become idle and neglect- 
ilil. Such conduct cannot be too much condemned, and those servants 
who practise it may depend upon it, that, sooner or later, they will 
have cause to repent Let it be remembered, that vice as well as virtue 
has its reward, thoug^h of a very different character. 

We shall conclude this our friendly advice to young cooks, by an 
extract from the "Cook's Best Friend,^ by the tte Dr. Kitchener. 
Nothing can be done in perfection, which must be done in a hurry, 
(except catching of fleas), — " Therefore," says the Doctor, " if you wish 
the dinner to he sent up to please your master and mistress, and do 
credit to yourself, be punctual ; take care, that as soon as the clock 
strikes, the dinner-bell rings. This shows the establishment is orderly

is extremely gratifying to the master and his guests, and is most praise- 
worthy in the attendants. But remember you cannot obtain this desir- 
lible reputation without j^ood management in every respect ; if you 
wish to ensure ease and mdependence in the latter part of yonr lifb, 
you naust not be nnwillin? to pay the price for which only they can be 
obtained, and earn themoy a diligent and faithful performance of the 
duties of your station in your youn^ days, in which if you steadily per- 
severe, you may depend upon ultunately receiving the reward your 
services deserve." 

All duties are reciprocaY; and if you hope to receive fkvour, endea- 
vour to deserve it by showing yourself fond of obliging, and grateful 
when obliged. Such behaviour will win regard, and maintain it ; en- 
ibrce what is right, and excuse what is wron^. 

Quiet, steady perseverance, is the only sprmg Which you can safely 
depend upon infallibly to promote your progress on the road to inde- 
pendence. 

If your employers do not immediately appear to be sensible of your 
endeavours to contribute your utmost to their comfort and interests, be 
not easily discouraged ; persevere^ and do all in your power to itAK^

more than what would be exacted. If you are desired to help iif any 
business that may not strictly belong to your department, undertake it 
cheerfully, ptUientlj and conscientiously. 

The foregoing adfvice has been written with an hoAest desire to aug- 
ment the comfort of those in the kitchen, who will soon find, that the 
ever-cheering reflection of having done tneir duty to the utmost of their 
ability, is in itself, with a Christian spirit, a never-failing source of 
oomlort in all circumstances and situations, and that 

" Virtue is its own reward.** 



[WHAT MUST ALWAYS BE DONE, AND WHAT MUST 

NEVER BE DONE. 

1. Keep yourself clean and tidy ; let your hands, in particular, be 
always clean whenever it is practicable. Afler a dirty job, always 
wash them. A cleanly cook must wash her hands many times in the 
course of the day, and will require three or four aprons appropriated to 
the work upon which she is employed. Your hair must never be 
blowsy, nor your cap dirty. 

2. Keep apart things that would injure each other, or destroy tlieir 
flavour. 

3. Keep every cloth, saucepan and all other utensilsiio their proper 
use, and when done with, put them in their proper places. 

4. Keep every copper stewpan and saucepan bright witliout, and 
perfectly clean within, and take care that they are always well 
tinned. Keep all your dish-covers well dried, and polished; and to 



APPENDIX. 405 

jOfl^t this, it wiH be necessary to wash them in scalding water as 
«oon as removed from the table, and when these things are done let 
them be hung up in their proper places. 

5. The gridiron, frying-pan, spit, dripping-pan, &c., must be per- 
fectly cleaned of grease and dried befi)re they are put in their proper 
places. 

6. Attention should be paid ta things that do not meet the sight in 
the way that tins and copper vessels do. Let, for instance, the pud- 
ding-clotli, the dish-cloth, and the dish-tub, be always kept perfectly 
clean. To these may be added, the sieve, the cullender, the jelly-bag, 
&^., which ought always to be washed as soon after they are used as 
m&y be practicable. 

7. Scour your rolling-pin and paste-board as soon after using as pos- 
sible, but without soap, or any gritty substance, such as sand or brick- 
dust ; put them away .perfectly dry. 

8. Scour your pickle and preserve-jars after they are emptied ; dry 
them and put them away in a dry place. 

9. Wipe your bread and cheese-pan out daily with a dry cloth, and 
ecald them once a week. Scald your salt-pan when out of use, and 
dry it thoroughly. Scour the lid well by which it is covered when in 
use. 

10. Mind and put all things in their proper places, and then you will 
easily find them when they are wanted. 

11. You must not poke things out of sight instead of cleaning them, 
and such things as onions, garlic, &c., must not be cut with the same 
knife as is us^ in cutting meat, bread, better, &c. Milk must not be 
put in a vessel used for greasy purposes, nor must clear liquids, such as 
water, &c., be put into vessels, which have been used for milk, and not 
washed ; in short, no vessel must be used for any purpose for which it 
is not appropriated. 

12. You must not suffer any kind of fix)d to become cold in any metal 
vessel, not even in well-tinned iron saucepans, &c., for they will im- 
part a more or less unpleasant flavour to it. Above all things you must 
not let liquid food, or mdeed any other, remain in brass or copper ves- 
sels after it is cooked. The rust of copper or brass is absolutely poi- 
sonous, and this will be always produced by moisture and exposure to 
the air. The deaths of many persons have been occasioned by the 
cook not attending to this rule. 

Id. You must not throw away the &t which, when cold, accumulates 
on the top of liquors in which fresh or salt meat has been boiled ; in 
short, you ought not to waste fat of any description, or any thing else, 
that may be turned to account ; such as marrow-bones, or any other 
clean bones from which" £)od may be extracted in the way of soup, 
brotli, or stock, or in any other way : for if such food will not suit your 
table, it will suit the table of the poor. Remember, " Wilful waste 
makes woful want*' 

14. A very essential requisite in a cook is punctuality : therefore rise 
early; and get your orders from your mistress as early as possible, 
and make- your arrangements accordingly. What can be prepared be- 
fore the business of roasting and boiling commences should always bo 
prepared. 

15. Do not do your dirty work at a dresser set apart for cleanly pre 



406 AFPBIVDIX. 

p&rationfl. Take care to have plenty of kitchen cloths, and mark theiA 
80 as a duster may not be mistaken for a pudding-cloth, or a knife-cloth 
for a toweL 

16. Keep ^our spit, if you u^ one, always free fVom rust and dost, 
and your vertical jack clean. Never draw up your jack with a weight 
upon it 

17. Never employ, even if permitted to do so, any knives, spoons, 
dishes, cups, or any other articles in the kitchen, which are used in the 
dining room. Spoons are sure to get scratched, and a knife used for 
preparing an onion, takes up its flavour, which two or three cleaning^ 
will not entirely take away. 

18. Take great care to prevent all preparations which are delicatb 
in their nature, such as custards, blancmange, dressed milks, &c., &c., 
from burning, to which they are very liable. The surest way to effec- 
tually hinder this is to boil them as the carpenter heats his glue, tkuH 
IS, by having an outside vessel filled with water. 

19. You ought not to do any thing by halves. What you do, ^ 
well If you clean, clean thoroughly, Iiaving nothing to do with the 
•• slut's wipe," and the ** lick and a promise." 

20. And last^ though not least, be teachable : be always desirous to 
learn — ^never be ashamed to ask for information, lest you should appear 
to be ignorant ; for be assured, the most ignorant are too frequently the 
most seli^pinionated and most conceited ; while those who are really 
well informed, think humbly of themselves, and regret that they know 

little.]

This has been reprinted from the author's most recent edition, and embrpeaf 
his extensive modifications and additions. It will therefore be fonnd eminently 
worthy a continuance of the great favor with whioU it has hitherto been reeeired. 

Of the solid merit of the work our Judgment may be gathered from what has alreadly 
been said. We will add that* from its infinite fund of anecdote, and happy variety of styles 
the book addreaaes. itself with equal claims to the mere general reader, as to the legal or 
hiRtorical Inquirer; and while we avoid the stereotyped commonplace of sflrming that n« 
Ubrary can be' complete without it, we feel constrained to afford it a higher tribute by pr(^ 
nouvcing it entitled to a distinguinbed place on the shelves of every scholar who is fbrtnnate 
enough to possess it.— /Va«er'< Mogazine.

stract of the most adranoed position of the general principles of the science, as

practical applications to the wants and purposes of civilited life, a task to which 
Dr. Lardner's immense and varied knowledge, and bis singular fielidlty and clear-

recommends it especially as the text-book for a practical age and country such ai

while it directs bis attention to the further extension of that wtHity 'by tbe fulness

With, twelve handsome colonred Haps. 

In one very neat royal 12mo. volume, extra cloth. $1.00. 

The intimate connection of Sacred History with the geography and physio : 
features of the various lands occupied hy the Israelites, renders a work like tl i 
present an almost necessary companion to all who desire to read the Scripturt / 
anderstnndingly. To the young, especially, a clear and connected narrative oi, 
the events recorded in the Bible, is exceedingly desirable, particularly when 
illustrated, as in the present volume, with succinct but copious accounts of the 
neighboring nations, And of ib« topography and political divisions of the countries 
mentionetl. coupled with the results of the latest investigations, by which Messrs, 
Layard, Lynch, Oliii, Durbin, Wilson, Stephens, and others, have succeeded ia 
throwing light on so. many obscure portions of the Scriptures, verifying its accu- 
tacy in minute partjoular?. Few more interesting class-books could therefore be 
found for schools where the Bible forms apart of eduA.tion, and none, perhaps^ 
more likely to prove of permanent benefit to the scholar. The iufluence which 
the physical geography, climate, and productions of Palestine had upon the Jewish 
people will hf found fully set forth, while the numerous maps present the various 
regions connected with Ihe subject at their most prominent periods.

thorough and uniform course of Latin instruction, on a definite system. Besides 
the advantages which these works possess in their typographical aocuraoy and 
careful adaptation to educational purposes, the exceedingly low price at which 
they are offered is a powerful argument in favor of their general introduction, as 
removing d barrier to the general diffusion of olaasical education in the size And 
costliness of the text-books heretofore in use. 

The series consists of the following volumes, clearly and handsomely printed, 
on good paper, In a uniform large ISmo. size, strongly and neatly bound, and

The very numerous recommendations of this series from classical teachers of the

sufficiently manifest that the efforts of the editors and publiahers have not been

age, and adapted to the improved modern systems of education.

Its merits I hafl not now for the first time to learn. I have used it for two years as a text- 
book, with the greatest satisftotlon. It was a happy conception, admirably executed. It is 
all that a text-book on.su^ a suliieet ean or need be, comprising a judicious selection of 
materials, easilv yet effectively wrought. The author attempts just as much as he ought to, 
and does well all that he attempts ; and 4he best of the book is tiie ganal spit% the genuine

The present work is reprinted from the Ust London Edition^ which wm «ar0-» 
fully revised by the author, and in which he embodies the latest investigations and 
discoveries. It may therefore be regarded as fully on a level with the most ad- 
vanced state of the science, and even better adapted than its predecessors as a 
full and reliable text-book for advanced dasees.

This treatise is too w«11 known, and too highly appredated In the sdentifio world, to need 
new praise. A distingwiaUngmecrit in ^is, as In the other prodnoUons of the author, is,

that the writer's meaning' ca^ neyer be misunderstood.— ^Prt^f. Sfmmd Jipnef, j^ermn

I know no treatise on ARtronomy comparable to " HerscheVs Outlines." It is admirably

It would not become me to speak of the sclentlflc merits of such a work by such an author;
