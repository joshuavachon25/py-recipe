GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING PREPARATION AND 
COOKING OF VEGETABLES 

1. Cook all vegetables uncovered after they reach the boiling point. 

a. To keep color and texture. 

b. To lessen odor of cooking. 

c. To let undesirable compounds escape in steam. 

2. a. Cook all fresh vegetables in boiling salted water. 

b. Start w^ithered vegetables in cold water unless they have been 
soaked. 

3. Some very young vegetables, such as peas or greens, can be cooked 
without the addition of water. 

4. Use water in which vegetables have been cooked, because it con- 
tains a large proportion of the mineral salts of the vegetables. 

5. Green vegetables should be cooked just long enough to make them 
tender. Overcooking makes them less digestible, as well as less palatable. This 
is especially true of cabbage and green beans. 

6. In preparing lettuce for salad, soak in cold water and cut under water. 
Chill by hanging in a draft or placing on ice. 

NOTE — Vegetables furnish 8.7 per cent of the protein ; 1 per cent of 
the fat and 12 per cent of the starch and sugar of the average American 
dietary and are therefore an important factor in the food supply and should be 
used to a much greater extent than they are. They contain valuable mineral 
salts and vitamines.

Page 17 



TABLE SETTING 

A table cloth, which has been carefully ironed with the crease running 
lengthwise, is spread on the table over a silence cloth or asbestos pad. 

The proper number of covers are placed at even intervals about the table 
and one inch from the edge. 

The knife is placed at the right of each cover, with the blade turning to- 
ward the plate. 

Spoons are placed next to the knife and the glass is placed at the end of the 
knife blade. 

Forks are placed at the left of the plate and pads or bread and butter plates 
at the end of the forks. 

The napkin is folded and placed next to the forks with the open corner at 
the lower right hand corner. 

Salt and pepper shakers may be placed toward the center of the table. 

Carving knife, fork and serving spoons are placed on the table at the right 
of platter. 

A doily, on which is placed a plant or low vase of flowers, may form the 
centerpiece. 

At breakfast or luncheon the table may be spread wath doilies instead of 
a cloth and smaller napkins may be used. Silver is placed as for dinner. 

TABLE MANNERS 

Sit as erect as possible and near to the table. 

Open napkin and place in the lap. 

There is but one correct way to hold the knife and fork. 

When they are used together the knife is held in the right hand and the 
fork in the left. 

When the knife is used for cutting, the first finger rests on the dull edge 
of the blade as near where it joins the handle as possible and the handle touches 
the palm of -the hand. 

When the fork is used with the knife it is held in such a manner that the 
first finger rests on the handle just above the tongs. 

In both cases the hand should almost cover the handle. 

A spoon is used for stirring or conveying food to the mouth. In either 
case the spoon is held as a pen is held. When not in use it rests on the saucer or 
plate. Never leave a spoon standing in a cup. 

When the fork is used for eating it is held in the right hand in the same 
manner as the spoon. 

Knives and forks when not in use lie on the plate, never on the table cloth 
leaning against the plate.

GENERAL RULES 

1. To test jars — Wash and partly fill with hot water, adjust rubbers and fasten 
tops down securely. Invert and allow to stand 5 minutes. If no water escapes, the 
jar is ready for use. If water escapes, examine top for imperfections. If possible, 
correct; if not, try thicker rubber or use two rubbers. 

2. Sterilize jars and tops by placing on a cloth in a pan of cold water and bring- 
ing to' boiling point. 

3. Sterilize rubbers by dipping in boiling water just before using. 

4. Wooden spoors are useful in handling hot jars.

a string securely about the top of the jar, with the end of the string hanging over the 
edge of the kettle.

JELLY AND PRESERVES 

Jelly is made from two general types of fruit, soft and hard fruits. 

Currants and grapes are soft fruits. 

Apples, crab apples and quinces are hard fruits. 



CURRANT or GRAPE JELLY 

L Wash and pick over fruit. 2. Measure. 3. Add one-half as much water 
as fruit and boil until the fruit thoroughly breaks open (from 5 to 10 minutes). 
4. Drain through one thickness of cheese cloth. 5. Bring juice to boiling point. 
6. Boil 2 minutes and drain through two thicknesses of cheese cloth. 7. Measure 
juice and add three-fourths as much sugar. 8. Boil until it sheets on a cold 
spoon or until two drops run into each other. 9. Skim. 10. Pour into sterilized 
glasses and allow to stand uncovered at least twenty-four hours. 11. Seal with 
paraffin. 

NOTE — Where water is used to extract fruit juices, never use equal amounts of 
sug'ar as ^he result is apt to be of a syrupy consistency instead of jelly. Do not skim 
jelly during the cooking process. 



CRAB APPLE JELLY 

L A\'ash and quarter apples. 2. Remove cores only when necessary. 3. Meas- 
ure and add an equal amount of water. 4. Cook until apples are thoroughly 
broken. 5. Drain and proceed as in grape jelly. 

NOTE — In making apple jelly use a tart apple and cut into small pieces. In 
making quince jelly always remove core and seeds, as they contain a sticky substance 
which prevents jelly from se'^ting. Pulp from fruit may be used to make marmalade. 
Cover jelly with paraffin. Be sure to melt the paraffin over a low flame. 



APPLE BUTTER OR MARMALADE 

L Prepare and cook apples as for jelly. 2. When soft rub through a sieve. 
3. Pleasure pulp and add % as much sugar. 4. If there is a small amount of 
pulp, cook for half an hour, if large amount, cook for an hour or more. 5. Stir 
often to prevent burning. Use a wooden spoon. 6. Remove from fire and skim. 
7. Fill sterilized glasses and seal. 

Cinnamon and cloves may be used to spice the butter. 

Page 33 



DOUGHS AND BATTERS 

Flour mixtures are divided into doughs and batters. Proportions may vary, 
but the general rule is as follows : 

A pour batter is equal quantities of liquid and flour — as sour milk griddle 
cakes. 

A drop batter is twice as much flour as liquid — as in muflins. 

A soft dough is two and one-half times as much flour as liquid — as baking 
powder biscuit. 

A stiff dough is from three to five times as much flour as licjuid — as in bread 
and cookies. 

The only flour mixture that is not toughened by stirring is bread. 

In all other mixtures, stir as little as possible, and use the folding or beating 
method. 



GENERAL RULES FOR LEAVENING AGENTS. 

1. All standard baking powders are of comparatively the same strength, so use 
the same amount in substituting one for another. 

2. Use two level teaspoons of baking powder to one cup of flour. 

3. One teaspoon of soda is equal in strength to three teaspoons of baking powder, 
so in substitu'ing baking powder for soda, use three times as much baking powder 
as soda. 

4. Use one-half a teaspoon of soda with one rup of sour milk. 

5. One teaspoon of soda is the maximum amount to use with one cup of molasses. 

6. In sour milk mixtures, such as griddle cakes, both soda and baking powder 
are necessary. With one cup of sour milk and one cup of flour, use one-half a tea- 
spoon of soda and one-half a teaspoon of baking power, ^he two together being equal to 
the two teaspoons of baking powder required for one cup of flour. — With one cup of 
sour milk and two cups of flour, use one-half a teaspoon of soda and two and one-half 
teaspoons of baking powder, the two together being equal to the four teaspoons of 
baking powder required for two cups of flour. 

7. When eggs are used, reduce the amount of baking powder. One teaspoon of 
baking powder is equal to two eggs. 

8. In yeast mixtures the amount of yeast to be used does not depend on the 
amount of flour or liquid, but on the food, temperature and length of time. In gen- 
eral use one cake to three cups of liquid. In shortening the process two or three 
cakes of yeast may be used. 

Page 34

the dough toward you with the tips of the fingers and push away from you with 
the palm of the hand. 6. Return to mixing bowl, moisten or butter top of dough to 
prevent formation of a crust. Cover and set in a warm place to rise until double its

NOTE — Milk or water m any proportion may be used in bread making. The 
double boiler is a good receptacle for raising bread in the school room. The water 
in the lower part being an easy way to control the temperature.
