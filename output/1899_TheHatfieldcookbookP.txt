and set away till cold. Remove ever}^ bit of fat when 
you wish to use the soup. Put in j^our tureen one- 
half cup of rice, which you have steamed till very 
tender. When the soup is boiling hot, beat an egg 
and stir it into a cup of milk in which a tablespoon 
of flour has been rubbed; put with this, a little at a 
time some of the scalding liquor, until there is no 
danger of the Q:gg curdling. Serve instantly as it 
will thicken by standing; season with pepper and salt.

SOUP STOCK.

boil slowly ten hours. Then strain into a bright 
tin, or stone pot. In the morning skim off" all the 
fat, turn the jelly out, and take off" all the sediment. 
Use the meat for hash. Do not boil vegetables with 
this stock as it causes it to sour quickly. 

Use celery in all kinds of soup when you can 
obtain it.

comes to a boil ,skim carefully aud boil slowly three

toes, allowing one-half hour for them to boil. Cook 
beets in a separate kettle. 

MRS. C. E. HUBBARD. 

BOILING VEGETABLES. 

In boiling beef and vegetables, put a tea cup of 
vinegar into the pot when the v/ater is cold, and the 
beef will be much tenderer, and cabbage and beets 
better flavored and will not fill the house with unplea- 
sant smell. The vinegar will not affect the taste of 
food. Rule: — All vegetables to go into fast boiling 
water, to be quickly brought to the boiling point again, 
not left to steep in the hot w^ater before boiling, which 
toughens them and destroys color and flavor.

TO EXTERMINATE RED ANTS. 

Tie sulphur in a cotton cloth and place where 
they are troublesome. Small piece of camphor gum 
or elder leaves will sometimes drive them away.

burns. Moisten the burned place and sprinkle on 
the soda. It seems to withdraw the heat and with it 
the pain.

Take the juice of i lemon, i dessert spoon vaseline, 
Yi cup sugar and the white of one ^%%. Beat all 
together. Take spoonful every hour.

add a little dissolved gum arable to the starch. A

MRS. GEO. BARNES. 

"Hot sunshine will remove scorch." 

"Clothes dry much quicker when borax is added 
to the hot starch just before using." 

"To remove soot from carpet, cover thickly with 
salt and then brush up." 

"When a felon first begins to make its appearance, 
take a lemon, cut off one end, insert the finger, and 
change ever}' three hours." 

"To remove paint or grease spots, take four 
tablespoons alcohol and one of salt, shake well together 
and apply with a sponge or brush."

We wish everj'one knew tlie actual worth of this preparation.

Dad:— 

You know Forbes & Wallace's store in Springfield! 
You know you can get almost everything there! You 
know that prices are generally lower there than 
elsewhere for the same articles! Do you also know 
that they take anything back which you bu}^ of them 
and do not find satisfactory? Do you know that they 
advertise: — 

"Your money back, if when 3'on get home 3^ou'd 
rather have it than what you got for it"?
