PHEEACE 



The table ! h.ow vast an influence it exerts on human life and charac- 
ter ; liow much, of the weal or woe of humanity clusters around it ! In 
determining our physical, mental, ahd moral conditions, no other one 
thing in all the material universe has so vast a power as that which we 
take daily in the shape of food and drink. 

Much, very much, of the sickness, suffering, and premature death in 
the world ; much of its vice, immorality, and crime, can, if traced to its 
starting-point, he found to originate here. Anxious days and sleepless 
nights are spent by parents, in their earnest endeavors to 'devise 
some means to subdue the peevishness, the fretfulness, the obstinacy or 
the immorality of their children, only to find alas! their admonitions 
unheeded, their exhortations thrown to the winds, their agonizing prayers 
of no avail; they little dreaming that the causes of this perverseness 
lie, in a great measure, within their own control ; that these unhappy 
mental and moral manifestations are caused by a disordered condition 
of the bodily functions, produced by the improper kinds and quantities 
of food which they have allowed them to eat. 

That abnormal conditions of the body never exist without more or 
less influencing the mind, no arguments are needed to prove. Take for 
instance the drunkard while under the dominion of alcohol. Of what 
avail are his own resolutions, or the prayers, the tears, the earnest 
entreaties of friends, to stay the fierce, ungovernable passions which rage 
within him, or to rouse him from the dull, leaden stupor into which the 
demon of drink often plunges its victims ? What are moral influences 
then? So many "wisps of straw" to bind the Samson of evil. But, 
remove the cause, then your appeals to his better nature mai/ be of some 
avail ; while it remains, never. 

It is but speaking the simple truth to say that fully one half the evil 
and misery which exists in the world, has its origin in improper dietetic 
habits. The starting-point of intemperance, in ninety-nine cases out of 
a hundred, is in the stimulating or gross food and drink received at a 
fond mother's table in infancy and boyhood, producing in time a craving 
for stronger stimulus, foimd at last in the intoxicating cup. 

And to that table, too, may be traced the origin of a majority of the 
countless diseases which people our cemeteries, and make this bright 
world of ours really a "vale of tears." 



All over the land are scattered, hj limidreds and thousands, wretclied 
invalids — poor, miserable dyspeptics, to whom life is a burden, and exist- 
ence a bane — consumptives, lingering witb one foot in tbe grave, wbo 
to-day might have been doing the work of strong and earnest men and 
women, had they and their parents but realized the truth of this. And 
to too many of them, years and years, yea, a lifetime of earnest effort in 
the "better way," are barely su£Bcient to undo the wrong which need 
never have existed. 

Health Reform does not seek to curtail the gustatory pleasures of the 
table, but rather to enhance them. No drunkard can enjoy his glass of 
brandy as the teetotaler does his cup of clear, cold, sparkling water. 

So, those who live upon rich and stimulating food are really losers, 
instead of gainers, in the pleasures of the table. The spices, condi- 
ments and seasonings universally employed, so far destroy the natural 
flavor of food that the taste of persons habitually accustomed to their 
use, becomes so perverted, that they can no more detect the real delicate 
flavor of the food itself, than the drunkard can appreciate the excel- 
lence of pure water; and their enjoyment is not to be compared in 
steady lasting endurance to that of those who live upon a truly hy- 
gienic diet, as all who have tried it throughly can testify. 

A cook-book containing directions for preparing a variety of hygienic 
dishes, which shall be at the same time practical, concise, and in a form 
cheap enough to bring it within the means of every family seems a desid- 
eratum hitherto unattained. 

That this little work may supply this want, and prove of practical 
value to those desirous of learning a more healthful method of liv- 
ing, is the earnest wish of 

The Author. 



THE HYGIEIIC COOK-BOOK 



BREAD AND BREAD-MAKING. 



As by common consent Bread is the " Staff of Life," the question 
naturally arises, " what are the best methods of making it ? " The 
common white flour fermented bread, which is so universally used, is 
very far from being the best as an article of diet The use of fine or 
bolted flour, has opened upon community a perfect "Pandora's Box" 
of evils in the shape of Constipation and the ten thousand ailments to 
which it gives rise. By the separation of the bran from the flour, not 
only a portion of the grain necessary to the proper distension of the 
stomach and bowels is removed, but it has been repeatedly proved by 
chemical analysis that the bran is as rich, or richer, in nutritious sub- 
stances than the flour. 

These are not merely the " notions " of '•' hair-brained," " bran- 
bread," " crazy fanatics !" but FACTS which commend themselves to 
the common sense of all who will investigate, which have been proved 
by the experience of thousands, and which have been demonstrated 
by the highest scientific authorities, a few of which we quote : 

Dr. Johnson, M.A„ F.E.S., F.aS., &c., in his "Chemistry of 
Common Life," says : " The bran or husk of wheat, which is separated 
from the fine flour in the mill, and is often coftdemned to humbler uses, 
is somewhat more nutritious than either the grain as a whole, or the 
whiter part of the flour. The nutritive quality of any variety of 
grain depends very much upon the proportion of gluten it contains ; 
and the proportions of this in the whole grain, the bran and the fine 
flour respectively, of the same sample of vrheat. are very nearly as 
follows — whole grain, 12 pr. ct. : whole bran, (outer and inner skins), 
18 pr. ct. ; fine flour, 10 pr. ct. 

(5) 



6 BREAD AND BREAD-MAKING. 

If the grain, as a whole, contain more than twelve per cent, of glu- 
ten, the bran and the flour will also contain more than is above repre- 
sented, and in a like proportion. The whole meal obtained by simply 
grinding the grain is equally nutritious with the grain itself By sift- 
ing out the bran, we render the meal less nutritious, weight for weight ; 
and when we consider that the bran is rarely less, and is sometimes con- 
siderably more than one-fourth of the whole weight of the grain, we 
must see that the total separation of the covering of the grain causes 
much waste of wholesome human food. Bread made from the whole 
meal is, therefore, more nutritious ; and as many persons find it a more 
salutary food than white bread, it ought to be more generally preferred 
and used." 

Prof. Youmans, author of the standard works on •* Chemistry," 
" Household Science, " Chemical Chart," etc., says : 

" The grain of which bread is made consists mostly of starch, gluten, 
and sugar. The ligneous husk of grain produces the bran, while the 
flour is formed by the interior white portions. The gluten is tougher 
and more difficult to grind than the starch, hence the finest and whitest 
flour, obtained by repeated siftings, contains a larger proportion of 
starch, the darker colored flour being richer in gluten ; and as the nu- 
tritive properties of flour are in proportion to the nitrogenized element 
(gluten), the latter will make the most nutritious bread." 

The " Eclectic Eeview," in an article entitled " Frauds in Foods," 
says : 

" Many of the most important elements of our blood, brain and bone 
Stre found in the greatest abundance in the colored, outer part of tho 
wheat, which we deem fittest for pigs ; so we fatten them and suffer our- 
selves. The difference in nourishing properties between whole meal and 
flour and very finely dressed flour amounts, in many cases, to fully one- 
third." 

Dr. Bennett says : 

" Now, if there is a well established fact emanating from chemical 
analysis, it is this : That superflne or very finely bolted wheat flour 
will not alone sustain animal life. This fact has been repeatedly dem- 
onstrated by Magendi, the greatest physiologist that ever lived. Hav- 
ing ascertained that the muscular and nervous tissues, including the 
whole brain or cerebral mass, was composed of nitrogenous matter, he 
readily concluded that starch, or the fecula of wheat, would not alone 
sustain animal life, for the reason that it contains not a particle of ni- 
trogenous matter. Consequently, he found by experiment, that animals 
fed exclusively on very finely dressed flour, died in a few weeks, where- 
as those fed on the unbolted thrived." 

Dr. John Ellis, Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medi- 
cine, says : 

''The worst case of scurvy I ever had to treat, occurred in a little 
girl five or six years old, who had lived entirely upon toast made of su- 
werfine flour." 

We might quote many more, but these must suflSce. 

The second objection to the common method of bread-making is 

the fermenting process to which it is subjected. Fermentation, as all 



BBEAD AND BKEAD-MAK.ING. 7 

persons at all conversant with chemistry know, is, as described by 
Professor Johnson, 

" The consequence of a peculiar action which yeast exercises upon 
moist flour. It first changes a portion of the starch of the flour into 
sugar, and then converts this sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid, in 
the same way as it does when it is added to the worts of the brewer or 
the distiller. As the gas cannot escape from the glutinous dough, it col- 
lects within in large bubbles, and makes it swell, till the heat of the 
oven kills the yeast plant, and causes the fermentation to cease." 
Prof. Youmans says: 

" If the fermentation proceeds too far, the dough becomes sour ; that 
is, the vinous passes into the acetous fermentation, the alcohol changes 
to vinegar." 

Who would think of taking a half-decayed apple or potato, and 
subjecting it to the action of heat to stay the process of putrefaction, 
and then placing it before human beings as food ? And yet this is 
precisely what is done by fermenta" ion. Take a commou bread 
" sponge," as it is called. Let it remain thirty-six hours longer than 
nsual, and what is the result ? — a sour, almost putrid mass. This 
process of putrefaction commences the moment the )^east is added to 
moist flour, and is only checked by the action of heat. 

Baker's bread is often still more objectionable, from the fact that an 
inferior article of flour is used which is disguised by the introduction 
of alum and other chemicals. 

Soda and saleratus, in all their forms, are decidedly injurious, and 
when introduced into bread, biscuit, and other articles of food, are a 
prolific source of disease. 

Having demonstrated the effects of bad material and management 
of it, we will consider what are the best materials and the best meth- 
ods of preparing and cooking them. 

Bread, to be the most wholesome and palatable, should contain but 
two ingredients— unbolted flour from the best quality of wheat or other 
grain, and pure water. The following, so far as we know, are the 
preferable methods of making it, arranged in the order of their re- 
spective merits : 

UNLEAVENED BREAD. 

No. 1. — Gkms. — Into cold water stir Graham flour sufficient to 
make a batter a trifle thicker than that used for ordinary griddle cakes. 
Bake in a hot oven in small tin patty-pans two inches square, and 
three fourths of an inch deep. 



f BREAD AND BKEAD-MAKING. 

Note.— This makes delicious bread. No definite rule as to the proportions of flour 
and water can be given, owing to the difference in the absorbing properties of various 
brands of flour. Of some kinds, the batter will require to be made considerably stiffer 
than the consistency above mentioned. A little experience will enable any person to 
approximate the right proportions with sufficient exactness. The flour should be stirred 
into the water very slowly in the same manner as in making mush. No more stirring 
is necessary after the flour is all added. If hard water is used in making them, they 
are apt to be slightly tough. A small quantity of milk will remedy this defect. 

Many persons have failed of sucess in making this bread from neg- 
lecting one very essential requisite — the size of the pans in which it 
is baked. If they are larger than the dimensions given, the bread will 
be heavy ; if smaller it will be dry and hard. But made this size, 
and filled full, if the flour is properly ground, the batter the right con- 
sistency, and the oven hot, (a hot oven being absolutely indispensable 
to success,) it will rise one half, and be almost as light and porous as 
sponge cake. 




Note.— We used separate pans for some time, but found them quite inconvenient. 
We have them now formed and wired together as represented in the above cut, and 
find them a very great improvement. 

Any tinman can make them, or with less trouble and no more expense, they may be 
procured of Miller & Browning, No. 15 Laight St., N. Y., who to supply the con- 
tinued demand for them, have had heavy iron moulds cast to form them, and can sup- 
ply them at the rate of $1.25 per square of a dozen tins. 

No. 2. — Diamonds. — Pour boiling water on Graham flour — stirring 
rapidly till all the flour is wet Too much stirring makes it tough. 
It should be about as thick as can be stirred easily with a strong iron 
spoon. Place the dough with plenty of flour upon the moulding 
board, and knead it for two or three minutes. Poll out one half an 
inch thick, and cut in small cakes. or rolls. If a large quantity is re- 
quired, roll about three-fourths of an inch thick, and cut with a knife 
in diamond shape. Bake in a very hot oven forty-five minutes. 

Note.— The names by which these two kinds of bread are known in our Institution 
are merely arbitrary. Years ago the guests of the house christened No. 2 "diamonds," 
from their shape. No. 1 being of quite recent introduction, and, as many think, much 
superior, some facetious patient, on their flrst appearance, suggested "gems" as an ap- 
propriate name, and, accordingly, "gems" went the round of the tables till the soubri- 
quet became firmly attached to them. 

No. 3. — Graham Biscuit. — Make Graham mush as for table. 
When cool, mix with it Graham flour sufficient to roll well. Knead 
for a few minutes, roll three-fourths of an inch thick, cut with a com- 
mon biscuit cutter, and bake in a hot oven from thirty to forty-five 
minutes. 

No. 4. — Graham Biscuit. — (Another Form.) Stir into cold water, 
Graham flour enough for a rather soft dough ; knead it for five or ten 
minutes, and bake the same as No. 3. 

Note.— When these have become a little dry or hard, out in small pieces, cover with 
rold water, soak till thorousrhly soft, when the water should be all absorbed. Strain 
thiouL'h a collander, mix Graham flour snffidoiit to roll, and bake in the same form as 
at first. This iry nven sup'nnor *o the oris-rinaV l.rr- i.i. 



BREAD AND BREAD-MAHING. 9 

No. 5.— "Wheat Meal Crisps.— Make a very stiff dough of Gra- 
ham flour and cold water : knead thoroughly, roll as thin as possible 
and bake for twenty minutes in a hot oven. 

No. 6. — Graham Crackers are made by mixing cold water and 
Graham flour together, and kneading very thoroughly. They can 
only be well made by the machinery used in cracker bakeries. 

RYE AND OAT-MEAL, BREAD. 

Unbolted rye or oatmeal, prepared after recipe No. 4, makes excel- 
lent and wholesome bread for those who hke the peculiar flavor of 
these grains. 

CORN CAKE. 

Pour 1 quart boihng water on 1 quart corn meal, and stir quickly. 
"Wet the hands and form the dough into small round cakes one-half 
an inch thick. The addition of a few raspberries, huckleberries, or 
any subacid fruit, is a decided improvement. Sweet apples, chopped 
fine, are also excellent. 

CORN MEAL GEMS. 

Stir slowly into one quart sweet milk, corn meal suflBcient to make 
a very thin batter. Bake in a hot oven in the gem tins. 
1* 



MUSHES AND POBRIDGES. 



l>r, Trall in his excellent "Hydropathic Cook Book," says : 

"For making unleavened bread, mushes, etc., the grain should be 
carefully cleaned — washed, if necessary — and care should be taken to 
select that which is full and plump. When ground at an ordinary 
flouring mill, the stones should be sharp, so as to cut the grain into 
very fine particles. If ground by dull stones, the bran will be mashed 
off in flakes or scales. The meal or flour should be fresh ground, 
and never kept a long time, as it deteriorates surely, though slowly, 
every day after being ground." 

Under the head of Mushes and Porridges, he has given a variety of 
very excellent recipes. I cannot do better than copy the chapter 
entire : 

" The reader will observe that salt is not mentioned as an ingredi- 
ent in this book. But as almost all persons are accustomed to the 
use of this seasoning, I can only say to them, if they cannot bring 
their appetite at once into subjection to unsalted aliment, they had 
better use a moderate quantity, and gradually diminish it. 

In all the cook books I am acquainted with, salt is put down as a 
fixture of every dish ; and mushes, especially Indian and rice, are 
usually considered as unendurably flat and insipid, unless abundantly 
salted. A little experience with unsalted food, and a Httle self-denial, 
will, however, enable all persons to relish not only mushes, but all 
other farinaceous preparations, with no other seasonings than sugar or 
milk." 

"Cracked Wheat Mush. — As the grits swell very much in boiling, 
they should be stirred gradually in boiling water until a thin mush is 
formed. The boiling should then be continued very moderately for 
one or two hours. 

^ If the grits are ground very coarse, they will require boiling five or 
six hours. A large cofi'ee mill will serve the purpose very well of 
grinding for a family. 

An ordinary iron pot will answer to boil the grits in, if they are 
constantly stirred, or if the vessel stand on legs, so that the blaze of 
the fire is not in immediate contact with it. The double boiler, how- 
ever (found at most hardware stores,) is the most convenient to pre- 
vent burning or scorching. It is a tin or iron vessel surrounded by 
hot water, and contained within another vessel which comes in con- 
tact with the fire. 

(10) 



MUSHES AND POKRIDGES. H 

Hominy. — This is generally, in this market, prepared from the 
Southern or white corn, whicli is cut into coarser or finer particles of 
nearly uniform size. It is cooked like the whcaten grits, and usually 
requires to be boiled one hour and a half. The fine-grained hominy 
can be well cooked in half an hour, by boiling a few minutes and 
then steaming it, without stirring, over as hot a fire as can be borne 
without scorching. Two quarts of water are required for one of 
hominy. 

Samp. — This is merely a very coarse hominy — the grains of corn 
being cut or broken into very coarse particles. It should be washed 
several times, and the water poured through a sieve to separate the 
hulls ; and it requires boihng five or six hours. 

This is made precisely like the mush of cracked wheat, or wheaten 
grits. It is particularly adapted to those who have long suffered from 
habitual constipation. To persons unaccustomed to the grain, the 
effect on the bowels is decidedly laxative. The meal must be fresh 
ground, and made of well-cleaned and plump grain. 

Indian-meal Mush. — White and yellow corn meal are made into 
the well-known mush called hasty pudding. Either kind is equally 
agreeable to most persons. It should be stirred very gradually into 
boiling water, so as to prevent lumping ; it should bo cooked from 
one to two hours. 

Oatmeal Mush.— This, in Scotland, is called "stirabout." It is a 
favorite with many persons, and makes a pleasant change of dishes. 
It is cooked precisely like Indian mush. 

Wheat-meal Mush. — This is an excellent article for infants and 
young children — much better than the farina, which is so extensively 
employed. It will do for a change in the cases of adults, but is not 
equal to the coarser preparations of the grain. It is cooked like 
Indian mush. 

Farina Mush. — This is too nutrative, or, rather, concentrated, an 
aliment for an every day dish, but will do occasionally for variety's 
sake. It is made into mush in the same way as Graham flour or 
Indian meal. 

EiCE Mush. — Put one pint of plump "head rice," previously picked 
over and washed, into three quarts of boiling water ; continue the 
boiling fifteen or twenty minutes, but avoid stirring it so as to break 
up or mash the kernels ; turn off the water ; set it uncovered over a 
moderate fire, and steam fifteen minutes. Eice is "poor stuff" with- 
out salt, say the cooks, and cook-books. If you find it so, reader, try 
a little syrup or sugar. 

Eice and Milk Mush. — Boil a pint of clean head rice fifteen or 
twenty minutes ; pour off the water ; add a little milk — mixing it 
gently so as not to break the kernels — and boil a few minutes longer. 

Corn Starch Blanc-mange. — rDissolve half a pound of corn starch 
in a pint of cold milk ; then put it into three pints of boiling milk, 
and boil very moderately five or six minutes. 



12 MUSHES AND PORRIDGES. 

Molded Farinacea. — Nearly all the boiled farinaceous foods may 
be molded to please the fancy, in teacups, glasses, or earthen molds. 
Wheaten grits, rice, farina, corn starch, etc., may be put into the molds, 
or dishes, previously wet in cold water, as soon as cooked, and when 
cooled, turn out on china or glass plates. The addition of a little 
whortleberry, raspberry, blackberry, or strawberry juice, will afford an 
innocent coloring material for those who have time and inclination to 
indulge in such amusements. 

Milk Pokridge. — Place a pint and a half of new milk, and half 
a pint of water over the fire ; when just ready to boil, stir in a table- 
spoonful of flour, wheat-meal, oatmeal, or corn-meal, previously mixed 
with a, little water ; after boiling a minute, pour it on bread cut into 
small pieces. 

Wheat-meal Porridge. — Stir gradually into a quart of boiling 
water half a pound of wheat-meal, and boil ten or fifteen minutes. It 
may be flavored with a little milk, molasses, or sugar. 

Oatmeal Porridge. — Eub three-quarters of a pound of oatmeal 
into a little cold water, 'till the mixture is smooth and even ; add it to 
three pints of boiling water; allow the whole to boil gently about 
twenty minutes. Serve with milk, syrup, or sugar. 

To those who use milk and desire a great variety, we may add that 
the cragked wheat, rye, oatmeal, farina, and hominy mushes, are by 
many considered far preferable if made of half milk. The cracked 
wheat mush is also improved by the addition of a few raisins, cherries, 
or dates, added at the commencement of the cooking process. A very 
palatable dish may be made very quickly, by stirring Graham flour 
into boiling milk, after the manner of hasty pudding, letting it cook 
for five or ten minutes. 



PIES AND PIE CRUSTS. 

Pies, as usually made, are among the greatest abominations of mod- 
ern cookery. The idea of eating a piece of bread an inch in thickness, 
with from one-quarter to a half or a whole inch of lard or butter 
would, by every sane person, be considered preposterous. But peo- 
ple use these same proportions of flour and grease in their pastry, 
thinking it delicious ! Consult any of the ordinary cook books, and 
you will find the recipes for pastry varying from half a pound to a 
pound of lard or butter to each pound of flour, and white flour at that ! 
Can anything be conceived which is more indigestible ? 

We give below recipes for making quite a variety of pies, which any 
cook after a little practice, can succeed in making, provided she has a 
h^-ui t in the work, and desires to see hygienic cooking take the place 
which it deserves. 



PIES AND PIE-CRUSTS. 13 

Potato Pie Crust. — Boil one quart dry, mealy potatoes. The 
moment they are done mash them, and sift through a coUander. Stir 
thoroughly together one cup Graham flour and one cup white flour, 
then add the potatoes, rubbing them evenly through the flour in the 
same manner as the shortening in common pie crust. Have ready 
one cup corn meal ; pour over it one and one-third cups boihng water, 
stirring it till all the meal is wet, then add it to the potatoes and flour, 
mixing only till thoroughly incorporated together. No more flour 
should be added. The moulding board should be well covered with 
dry flour, however, as it is slightly difiBcult to roll out. It should be 
rolled very thin, and baked in a moderate oven. 

Note. — It is very essential that the above conditions should all be complied with. 
Bear in mind that the potatoes must be hot, and mixed immediately with the flour ; the 
water be poured, while boiling, upon the corn meal, and the whole mixed together very 
quickly and baked immediately. Inattention to any of these requisites will be quite 
apt to insure a failure. 

Cream Pie Crust. — Take equal quantities of Graham flour, white 
flour, and Indian meal ; rub evenly together, and wet with very thin 
sweet cream. It should be rolled thin and baked in an oven as hot as 
for common pie crust. 

Note. — This makes excellent pastry if properly baked. Many patients have said to 
us they did not see how they could ever asain relish the pastry "in common use (this is 
BO much sweeter and more palatable, to say nothing of its wholesomcness.) It is more 
generally relished than the potato crust, although not quite so hygienic. 

Pumpkin Pie. — Select a pumpkin which has a deep, rich color, and 
firm, close texture. Stew and sift in the ordinary manner ; add as 
much boiling milk as will make it about one-third thicker than for 
common pumpkin pie. Sweeten with equal quantities of sugar and 
molasses, and bake about one hour in a hot oven. 

Note. — Those who will try this method will be surprised to find how delicious a pie 
can be made without eggs, ginger, or spices of any kind. The milk being turned boiling 
hot upon the pumpkin, causes it to swell in baking, so that it is as light and nice as 
though eggs had been used. 

Squash Pie. — This is even superior to pumpkin, as it possesses a 
richer, sweeter flavor, and is far preferable. It is made in precisely the 
same manner as pumpkin pie. 

Sweet Potato Pie. — Boil and sift through a collander, nice, ripe, 
sweet potatoes, add boiling milk, and make the same as pumpkin pie. 

Sweet Apple Pie. — Pare mellow, sweet apples, and grate them 
upon a grater. A very large grater is necessary for this purpose. 
Then proceed as for pumpkin pie. 

Sour Apple Pie. — Take nice, tart apples — spitzenbergs are best, 
although pippins, greenings, russets, etc., are excellent. Slice them ; 
fill the under crust an inch thick ; sprinkle sugar over them ; add a 
spoonful or two of water; cover with a thin crust, and bake three- 
fourths of an hour in a moderate oven. 

Pie-Plant Pie. — Remove the skin from the stalks ; cut them in 
small pieces; fill the pie dish evenly full; put in plenty of sugar,-a 
teaspoonful of water ; dredge a trifle of flour evenly over the top ; 
cover with a thin crust, and bake the same as apple pie. 

Note.— If the stalks are not very tender, it is Letter to partially stew before baking. 



14 PIES AND PIE-CRUSTS. 

Apple and Pie-Plant Pie. — Equal quantities of apple and pie plant 
made in the same manner as all pie plant, make excellent pie. 

Dried Whortleberry Pie. — To two quarts dried whortleberries add 
one pint dried plums ; look over carefullf ; add sugar to the taste, and 
slew as for the table ; bake between two crusts about one hour. 

Dried Elderberry Pie — Is made in the same manner, and is 
nearly as good as the preceding. 

Gooseberry Pie. — This is made in precisely the same manner as 
currant pie ; it is very palatable. 

Cherry Pie. — Choose fair, ripe cherries, the large black English 
being the best for this purpose ; wash and look them over carefull}' ; 
fill the pie plate evenly full ; strew sugar over the top ; dredge in 
plenty of flour ; cover with a moderately thick upper crust, and bake 
one hour. 

Easpberry Pie. — This stands at the head of the list of all berry 
pies in point of excellence. Take nice ripe berries, either red or black 
are about equally good ; wash and pick them over carefully ; place 
them an inch or more thick on the under crust ; strew a small quan- 
tify of sugar, and a trifle of flour over them ; put on the upper crust, 
and bake half an hour. 

Blackberry Pie. — This is made in the same manner as the pre- 
ceding. All berries for pies should be ripe or nearly so, and as fresh 
as possible. 

"Whortleberry Pie. — Whortleberries make excellent pies, and are in 
market usually longer than any of the summer fruits. It is made 
in the same manner as raspberry pie. 

Strawberry Pie. — Is made in the same way also. This fruit is 
rather acid, and requires considerable sugar to make it pleasant. 

Cranberry Tart. — Wash the berries in a pan of water, rejecting 
all the bad ones ; simmer them till they become soft and burst open ; 
strain through a fine wire seive, removing all the hulls ; add sugar to 
the taste ; bake on a thick under crust in a moderate oven. 

Peach Pie. — Select rich, juicy peaches, of a rather small and nearly 
uniform size. They should be very ripe ; wash them thoroughly to 
remove all the furz ; fill the pie dish with them ; sprinkle sugar and 
a little flour over them ; add a tablespoonful of water ; cover and 
bake one hour. 

Note.— K tlie peaches are not very ripe, it is better to pare, stone, and slice them. 

Plum Pie — Is made in the same manner as the peach pie. It is 
not as wholesome, as it requires much more sugar to make it at all 
palatable. 

Apple Puffs. — Make a crust the same as for cream pie crust, 
using rather thicker cream, however; roH as thin as possible; cut 
out in small round cakes with a common biscuit cutter ; take one of 
these, wet it around the edge, and place in the center a teaspoonful 
of apple sauce. Take another and cut with a small cracker cutter a 



PUDDINGS. 16 

hole in the center about one inch in diameter ; place the ring which 
is left upon the first one, and pinch the edges tightly together. Bake 
in a quick oven. 

Note.— These, if rightly made, are very nice. Any kind of fruit may be used in 
place of apple sauce, by stewing it, and simmering down till very little juice remains. 

Currant Pie. — Currants are made into pies by stewing them, and 
sweetening according to the degree of acidit}", and baking between two 
crusts in the ordinary manner. Or better still, merely fill the pie 
with them without any previous cooking. Sprinkle sugar over ; dredge 
in a little flour, and bake the same as apple pie. 

I have been much more minute in giving these recipes than persons 
accustomed to cooking would deem at all necessary. I have done 
so because hundreds of ladies who have no practical knowledge of 
even the ordinary methods of cookery, are yearly adopting our S3\s- 
tem, and as they generally find it impossible to obtain help in their 
own homes who are at all conversant with it, they feel the necessity 
of learning its details for themselves. 



PUDDINGS. 



Many physiologists object, and justly, to the extensive use of pud- 
dings as an article of diet. Tliey admit of but very imperfect masti- 
cation and insalivation, even in their best forms, and are to be permit- 
ted rather than recommended. 

However, as people usually demand something as a dCvSsert, occa- 
sionally, by way of variety, they are admissible. I give below 
recipes for the most Hygienic methods of making them. Quite a 
number of them are copied from Dr. Trail's Hydropathic Cook Book : 

Rice Pudding. — To two-thirds of a cup of rice add half a cup of 
sugar, half a cup raisins, and two quarts milk. Stir all together and 
bake very slowly about three hours. 

Baked Apple Pudding. — -Pare, core, and slice about two quarts 
nice tart apples. Add to them one teacup full of Indian meal, one 
cup Graham flour, and stir all together. Pour over them three-fourths 
of a cup of sugar dissolved in one cup cold water, stirring till all 
the flour is wet. Strew Indian meal smoothly over the bottom of a 
deep basin or pan to prevent sticking, and turn the mixture into it, 
smoothing it evenly over the top. Then spread smoothly over it a bat- 
ter made by stirring together half a cup cold water, three tablespoon- 
fuls of Indian meal, three ditto of Graham flour, and one tablespoon- 
ful sugar. Bake about two hours and a half. ^ 

Note. — This is to be eaten with sweetened cream or a sauce made by stirring into 
one quart boiling milk two heapiug tablespoonfuls of com starch, moistened with cold 
milk, letting it boil for five or ten minutes afterward. Sweeten according to taste. 

Plum Pudding. — One quart Indian meal, one cup molasses, one 
cup raisins, one quart boiling water. Stir all together and steam three 
hours. This is to be eaten with the same kind of sauce as for baked 
apple pudding. 



16 PUDDINGS. 

EusK Pudding. — One and one-third cups rusk, half a cup sugar, 
two cups sweet apples, sliced, two quarts milk. Stir together and 
bake two hours and a half. 

Baked Indian Pudding, — Two quarts sweet milk, one heaping 
teacup full of Indian meal, one-third cup molasses, one-third cup 
sugar. When the milk is boiling hard, dip out one-half of it, and 
into the remainder stir the meal slowly, taking care that no lumps 
remain in it. Add the rest of the milk, the sugar and molasses, and 
bake about two hours, or until it is a bright cherry color. Stir once 
or twice the first half hour, but not afterward. 

This proportion of meal will not hold good in all cases, owing to 
the difference in the thickening properties of different kinds. Of some 
it will require one and one-third cups, others one and a half. This 
can easily be determined by one trial. 

Sago Pudding. — Two quarts boiling milk, one cup sago, three- 
fourths cug sugar, two cups sweet apples sliced. Bake one hour and 
a half. 

Tapioca Pudding. — Two quarts milk, one cup tapioca, one cup 
sugar, two cups sweet apples, sliced. Bake one hour and a half. 

Sago and Apple Pudding. — Take six ounces of sago, previously 
washed and picked, five large, rich apples, peeled, quartered and cored, 
and one teacupful of sugar. Pour boiling water on the sago ; let it 
stand till cold ; then mix in the apples and sugar, and bake about 
one hour. 

Pearl Barley Pudding. — Pick and wash half a pound of pearl 
barley ; soak it in fresh water over night ; pour off the water ; add 
one quart new milk and a teacupful of sugar ; and bake one hour in 
a slow oven. 

Barley and Apple Pudding. — Pick and wash half a pound of 
pearl barley ; soak it in water twelve hours ; then put it into a pan 
with three pints of water ; let it boil ten hours ; pour it into a pie 
dish ; put in half a pound of apples, sliced ; add two ounces of sugar, 
and bake one hour in a moderate oven . 

Bread Pudding. —Pour a quart of boihng milk on as much bread, 
biscuit or crackers, broken or cut into small pieces, as will absorb it ; 
cover it and let it remain till quite cool ; then sweeten and bake an 
hour and a half. 

Cracked Wheat Pudding. — Boil wheaten grits till quite soft ; then 
dilute the mush with milk to the proper consistency. It should be 
rather thin ; sweeten and bake one hour. 

Hominy Pudding. — Mix cold, boiled hominy with milk till suf- 
ficiently diluted ; sweeten and bake in a hot oven an hour and a half, 
or two hours. 

Hominy Pudding. — (another form.) Into two quarts boiling milk, 
stir one large cupful of uncooked hominy. Add one half cup sugar, 
one half cup raisins and bake two hours. 



PUDDINGS. 17 

Christmas Pudding. — Mix together a pound and a quarter of flour 
or meal, half a pint of sweet cream, a pound of stoned raisins, four 
ounces of currants, four ounces of potatoes, mashed, five ounces of 
brown sugar, and a gill of milk. When thoroughly worked together 
add eight large spoonfuls of clean snow ; diffuse it through the mass 
as quickly as possible ; tie the pudding tightly in a bag previously 
wet in cold water, and boil four hours. 

Macaeoni Snow Pudding. — Take three ounces macaroni, one 
pint of new milk, one gill of cream, four of brown sugar or molasses, 
and eight tablespoonfuls of snow. Simmer the macaroni in the milk 
till well mixed ; add the sugar and cream ; then stir in the snow 
quickly and bake immediately till slightly browned. 

EicE AND Apple Pudding. — Boil half a pound of rice in half a pint 
of milk till it is soft ; then fill the pudding dish half full of apples, 
which have been pared and cored ; sweeten with brown sugar or mo- 
lasses ; put the rice over the fruit as a crust, and bake one hour. 

Snow Ball Pudding. — Pare and core large mellow apples, and 
inclose them in cloths spread over with boiled rice, and boil one hour. 
Dip them in cold water before turning them out. They may be 
eaten with syrup, sugar or sweetened milk. 

Faeina Pudding. — Mix ten ounces of farina with half a pint of 
cold milk ; put one quart of milk over the fire, and while it is boiling 
stir in the farina gradually, and let it simmer fifteen or twenty min- 
utes. It may be served with milk, fruit, jelly or sugar. 

Fig a*nd Cocoanut Pudding. — Wash one pound of figs in warm 
water; soak them till soft ; add to them one grated cocoanut with its 
milk, and four ounces of sugar ; then knead with them all as much 
wheat meal as can be worked into a rather soft dough, ( If in the 
cold season, three or four spoonfuls of snow will make it lighter.) 
Tie it in a pudding bag, not very tight, as it will swell some ; and 
boil two hours. 

Apple Pudding. — Boil one pound and a half of good apples with a 
gill of water and half a pound of brown sugar, till reduced to a smooth 
pulp ; stir in one gill of sweet cream, a tablespoonful of flour or fine 
bread crumbs ; flavor with a little lemon juice or grated lemon, and 
bake forty minutes. 

Potato Apple Dumplings. — Boil any quantity of white mealy 
potatoes ; pare, and mash them with a roUing pin ; then dredge in 
flour enough to form a dough ; roll it out to about the thickness of 
pie crust, and make up the dumplings by putting an apple, pared, 
cored, and quartered, to each. Boil or bake one hour. 

Note.— If the crust be made in the same maimer as for cream pie crust, these are 
very nice. 

Green Corn Pudding. — To one quart of grated ears of sweet corn, 
add a teacupful of cream, one gill of milk, a tablespoonful of flour, 
and two ounces of sugar ; mix all together and bake an hour and f:

THE FRUITS. 



"We come no"w to one of tlie most important departments of dietetics, 
viz. : fruit, and tlie necessity of its culture, preservation, and use. Next 
to good bread, there is nothing that can compare in value as an article of 
diet with good ripe fruit. People have been accustomed to consider fruit 
more in the light of a relish and a luxury, rather than as what it really 
should be — a staple article of diet, and a necessity of every meal. 

"Would people place their bread and fruit as the central dishes of their 
tables, around which other dishes are grouped as convenience or taste 
may dictate, instead of as now placing the meat as the staple article, what 
a vast amount of labor, sickness, and suffering would be avoided ! 

Good unleavened bread and the variety of fruits in their season contaia 
all the elements necessary to the support of human Kfe, And while there 
is a large class of vegetables, which are nutritious, palatable, and whole- 
some, making variety enough to suit the most fastidious, yet fruit must 
ever take the precedence as the best food for human beings. 

But, say many, " fruit is so expensive, we can't afford it ; besides, if all 
were to use fruit freely, there would not be half enough in the country 
to supply the markets." No fear on that score. Let the demand come, 
and the supply will soon follow. And as to not being " able to afford 
it," let us see. Suppose, good friends, you dispense entirely with your 
tobacco, tea, coffee, pork, nutmeg, pepper, and all manner of spices ; your 
cakes, pickles, preserves, etc. ; you would find your tables wotdd cost ^u 
much less than they now do, and you would be infinitely the gainers, not 
only in health, strength, and happiness, but also in the pleasures of the 
table. 

And until our farmers turn their attention more to fruit culture, 
which they can easily do if they choose ; untU. they give it the place 
and importance which it deserves and demands, all attempts at diet- 
etic reform will be for their wives an up-hill business; and will, in 
a majority of cases, only end at last in total failure. Now a good 
fruit garden is generally looked upon as a fine luxury — a thing very 
(18) 



FRUITS. 19 

desirable but not at all practicable. — aplol of ground to be planted and 
taken care of, if planted and cared for at all, at odd moments, or, 
else neglected entirely ; whereas, it should be considered a necessity, 
an inseparable adjunct of every farm, no more to be dispensed with or 
neglected than the corn crop or wheat field. And our farmers will 
find that the outlay of time and labor requisite to plant a fruit garden 
which shall soon yield an abundance of delicious fruit, will be much 
less than they have any idea of. And if they will but try the exper- 
iment of planting even two acres to strawberries, raspberries, Lawton 
blackberries, grapes, peaches, plums, pears, cherries, currants, goose- 
berries, etc., and devote the time, even, that they now spend in raising, 
feeding and butchering their hogs, (those measly, scrofulous abomina- 
tions,) to ■ its cultivation and care, I think they will find themselves 
not only vastly the gainers in health and happiness, but that they 
will also have more toward supplying their families with good whole- 
some food from two acres, than from any ten devoted to stock raising. 
Fruit should be used as far as possible in its natural state. Eipe, 
uncooked apples, pears, peaches, plums, grapes, strawberries, raspber- 
ries, etc., are incomparably superior in point of wholesomeness to the 
same fruits when cooked, and should, in their season, be upon the table 
at every meal. Many persons may object to tliis, especially during 
the summer months, saying that fruit is the cause of summer and 
bowel complaints, etc. That unripe fruit at any time, and even the 
best of ripe fruit eaten between meals, especially if meat forms a part 
of the daily food, often does induce these disorders I admit, but that 
only proves the truth of the old adage, " The greatest blessings become 
the greatest curses if wrongly applied." The same is true of fruit as 
of anything else. It should never under any circumstances be eaten 
between meals. The majority of the diarrheas, fevers, etc., so prev- 
alent in summer, are owing chiefly to the heating, stimulating effects 
of the meat, spices, condiments, rich cake, pastry, etc., in common use. 
Very few cases of these diseases have ever been known to occur, 
where the principal part of the person's diet had been coarse bread, 
ripe fruit and good vegetables. And if those who regard a mixed 
diet as necessary, would, during the summer months, partake very 
sparingly of meat, substituting fruit mainly in its place, eating it as a 
part of, and only with their regular meals, and in proper quantities, 
they would find their doctor's fee sensibly diminished, and their own 
health vastly improved. As far as practicable, a supply of long-keeping 
fruits should be secured for the winter and early spring ; but at 
present it is hardly possible to preserve a quantity sufficient for the 
whole year, without some artificial means of preservation. As to tl-,e

labor of canning fruit, it is much less than is generally supposed. All 
the smaller kinds, such as berries, cherries, peaches, etc., can be 
canned much more easily and ejxpeditiously than they can be dried. 
I give below the plan recommended by the xImerican Agricul- 
turist, a paper, by the way, which no farmer's family can afford 
to do without. 



PEESERVING FEUITS. 

"For several years past we have been trying to abolish the old mode 
of preserving fruits, viz. : the addition of pound for pound of sugar, 
and stewing them down to an indigestible mass in order to make them 
* keep.' Our efforts in this direction have been in a measure suc- 
cessful ; the high price of sugar this year will do much toward the 
adoption of the newer and better mode. All kinds of fruits can be 
preserved for a year, or more, with the use of little or no sugar, and 
at the same time retain nearly all their natural flavor. The process 
is not more difficult, and is less costly than the stewing process, while 
the fruit is far more delicious and healthful. The whole operation 
depends upon simply heating the fruit through, and then keeping 
it entirely free from the access of air. 

FEriT JARS. 

Periodically, as the fruit season approaches, there are numerous fruit 
jar inventions, patented and otherwise, brought before the public with 
wonderful assurance and an indefinite number of extravagant recom- 
mendations. Some seal with wax, others with India rubber and cast 
iron ; in some the tops are screwed on ; in others wedged ; and in 
others wired. Some tin, some glass, and some stone, but all are " per- 
fect," if the claims of the inventors and manufacturers are fully 
credited. "We have tried most of these fruit jars, and while many 
of them are good, our experience has led us to adopt the cheapest kinds 
of glass bottles and jars. Tin cans are not safe. While in a majority 
of cases they may answer well for a season or two, there is always 
danger of their corrosion, or rusting, and the consequent production of 
poisonous salts of tin. Besides, it is desirable to have the fruit in 
transparent vessels so that it can always be examined. Good well- 
glazed stone-ware bottles and jars are not objectionable on account 
of corrosion, but they are opaque, so that the contents can not be seen, 
and are but little cheaper than cheap glass. 

During the past year we have kept several bushels of fruit of differ- 
ent kinds, always in good condition, and the portion now unused is 
almost as fresh and delicious as when first picked. 
For keeping we have used all sorts of glass bottles 
and jars, holding from a pint to two quarts each 
— including several of the patent jars with caps 
of various patterns. Among these were a dozen -^ _ .__^- 
glass jars with India rubber rings expanded by a tp i 

compressing screw, of which five gave way and the x iG. i. 

fruit was lost. Of the common glass bottles and jars we have not lost 
one. There is hardly a glass bottle of whatever form that cannot be 
tui-nod to account for preserving fruits — even junk bottles, soda-Y.'ater

tottles, jars, &c., &c. Tiie best form is a wido-moutlied quart bottle or 
jar, the neck drawn in to give a shoulder for the cork to rest upon. 




Fig. 2. 



Fio. 3. 



For tlie larger fruits wide necks are needed; for tlie smaller terry 
fruits, narrow necks answer perfectly. 

PREPAHIITG THE FUriT. 

Our method is, to put the fruit in a preserving kettle of some kind 
— a glazed iron kettle, or even a tinned one, or a tin pail will do — 
and sweeten it with just sugar enough to fit it for the table. The 
sweetening is added in the form of a syrup made by boiling from one to 
three pounds of sugar (usually 2 lbs.) with one quart of water. The 
more juicy fruits, such as strawberries, require less syrup, while pears 
and quinces require more. The fruit is heated with the syrup just 
long enough to scald it through. Some prefer to use less sweetening 
and add more when the fruit is to be used. Others use no sugar ; 
they think the fruit keeps just as well, and preserves its aroma better 
without any sugar. We prefer to use all the sugar that is to be 
needed, believing that the fruit will probably keep more certainly, and 
it is then always ready to poirr out at once upon the table. The fruit 
to be preserved should be in good condition — ripe, but not over-ripe, 
nor containing any decayed portions. Tomatoes are peeled, and then 
cooked down one-half, as this makes a better sauce, and requires less 
bottle room. 

BOTTLING THE FRIJIT. 

The bottles or jars are thoroughly cleansed, and each one fitted with 
a stopper. For these, soft corks are best ; but they may be made of 
soft dry wood. For each bottle or jar we provide a little tin " patty- 
pan," (fig. 1,) costing one-half to one cent each by the quantity. Tea- 
saucers will answer. For cement we heat together in an old tin basin 
or iron kettle, one pound of rosin, and one and one-half to two ounces 



of tallow. This may he mixed in quantity, and melted from time 
to time as wanted. We formerly used a little over one ounce of tallow 
to one pound of rosin, but further experience is in favor of a softer 
cement, wlien the fruit is to stand in a cool cellar. While the fruit is 
being heated, as above described, the bottles are well warmed by setting 
them near the fire and frequently turning them ; or better, by setting 
them in cold water in a wash-boiler and heating to the boiling point. 
The fruit being barely scalded through, it is dipped hot into the heated 
bottles, through a funnel, if the bottle necks are small. This is done 
carefully, bo as not to mash the fruit. The bottles are filled up to 
where the bottom of the stoppers will come ; they are then jarred a 
little to make the air bubbles rise, and more fruit or syrup added if 
needed. The tops and necks are then wiped clean, inside and out and 
the stoppers put in, and sunk to a level with the top. Tlje cement 
being warmed in the mean time, a little is dipped on over the stoppers 
to close them tightly. The bottles are then turned necks down in the 
little patty-pans, or saucers, (fig. 2,) and a quantity of cement dropped 
in to completely enclose the stoppers and necks. When cold the bottles 
may be set either side up (fig. 2 or 3). The cooling will shrink the 
contents so as to create a strong inward pressure, but the patty-pans 
prevent the stoppers from being pressed in, and the cement shuts out 
the air. 

The whole process is simple and quickly performed. After the fruit 
is prepared, two persons will heat it, and put up 50 to 100 bottles in half 
a day. We prefer quart bottles, as these furnish enough for once open- 
ing. If cork stoppers are used, they are rendered soft and pliable, and 
may be crowded into a small orifice, by first soaking them in hot 
water. 

SUBSTITUTE FOR PATTY-PAJifS. 

The patty-pans are simply circular pieces of tin, stamped in the form 
of a cup or plate, two to three and one-half inches across. We buy 
them at wholesale for 87 cts., or $1.25 per gross. But any kind of cup 
to hold the wax, will answer. We have seen the common blacking 
boxes used, bottom for one jar or bottle, and the top or cover for an- 
other. Blocks of wood, or bits of board, cut out 
into cup-form with a gouge, or bored only part 
way through with a large auger, answer every | 
purpose. They should be partly filled with ce- 
ment, before turning the bottle into them. No' 
one need look far for the materials. The old 
bottles about the house, thoroughly cleaned, the* 
tin boxes, or old saucers, or wooden blocks, and ■^^^* ^' 

some rosin are all the apparatus needed. " 

The above method is good, but the following is still better, being 
safer, surer, more simple and less expensive. Out of hundreds of 
quarts which last year were put up in this manner for the Hj^gienic 
Institute, not one has been lost, and we have them now, in July, as 
perfect as the hour the}'' were canned. No corks are used ; the cloths 
will answer a second year, and as soon as the bottles are cold it can 
be ascertained with absolute certainty whether they are air-tight or 
not. The following is 




FRUITS. 23 

Our Method. — Take common, wide-mouthed glass bottles or jars ; 
those with a rim around the neck are preferable. Procure thick Can- 
ton flannel ; cut it into squares sufficiently large to cover the top and 
neck of the jar. Dip these pieces into heated grafting wax made by 
melting together one pound rosin, two ounces beeswax and one and 
one-half ounces tallow. Several pieces may be put in at one time, 
and should be allowed to remain in until they are perfectly saturated 
with the wax. Just before filling a jar with fruit, take out one of 
these pieces, thus allowing it to cool a little. By doing so they can 
be handled with greater ease and there is no danger of the wax run- 
ning through them into the fruit. After the wax has been kept hot a 
long time it is apt to harden slightly. A little tallow should then 
be added. 

In preparing the fruit, one pound of sugar to six pounds of rasp- 
berries, wild blackberries, whortleberries, etc., is sufficient — while for 
Lawton blackberries, strawberries, and the more acid fruits, one pound 
to four is requisite. Add a small quantity of water and cook the fruit 
a trifle less than if it were to be used immediately upon the table. 

Heat the bottles to prevent breaking ; this may be done by placing 
them underneath the stove, or else by putting them into a kettle of 
cold water and gradually heating it. Pour the hot fruit into the hot 
bottle, tilling it full ; wipe the top and outside of the neck of the 
bottle PERFECTLY DRY ; havc ready a piece of white paper cut so that 
it will just fit the inside of the mouth of the bottle, and lay it on the 
top of the fruit Now you are prepared for the sealing process. The 
pieces of Canton flannel being all ready, having been previously satu- 
rated with the wax and allowed to cool three or four minutes, place 
one of them over the mouth of the bottle, drawing it as tightly as pos- 
sible, and then wind a piece of strong twine round and round, binding 
the edges of the cloth firmly against the neck of the bottle. Then 
with a spoon dip on a little of the hot wax spreading it evenly over 
the top of the cloth, and over this place a paper large enough to cover 
the top and neck of the bottle, smoothing it as closely as possible, and 
the jar is sealed. As soon as the bottles cool, a glance will determine 
whether they are air-tight or not, as, if so, there will be a slight de- 
pression of the cover. The least hole "will prevent this concavity, 
and thus indicate at once the necessity of repeating the sealing pro- 
cess." If care be taken, not one bottle in forty will fail of being 
perfectly sealed at first. 

In a very large family, glazed stone jugs, holding from one to two 
gallons, may be used. In this case the handles of the jugs will interfere 
with the tying of the cloths, and corks will therefore have to be sub- 
stituted in place of them. Immerse the corks in hot water till thor- 
oughly soaked, (they should be from one inch and a half to two inches 
in length, and should fit the jug so tightly that previous to soaking it 
will be very difficult to drive them in) — fill the jug with fruit, then 
with a hammer or mallet drive the cork in tightly till the top of it is 
just level with the mouth of the jug. Dip on plenty of the hot wax, 
covering the whole top completely. When cold, set them away in a 
cool, dry place, and they will keep for years as fresh as when first put up.

DRYING FRUITS. 



In order to save various kinds of fruits and ensure variety, next to 
canning, the best method is that of drying, and for the larger fruits, 
such as apples, etc., the latter is much the cheaper and more practica- 
ble method. 

The essential requisites in drying fruit are : First, that it should 
dry quickly, so as to preserve as far as possible its natural flavor. 
Second, that it should dry thoroughly in order to keep well ; and 
third, that it should be kept free from dust and flies. ' 




The accompanying engraving represents it ; {h) is a rack four feet 
long and about one and one-half feet wide, made of common wall lath 
nailed together one-tenth to one-fomi;h of an inch apart, according 
to the size of the fruit to be dried. A lath or strip of board one inch 
wide is nailed round the edge to prevent the fruit's falling off. The 
whole expense is but a mere trifle. Any person who can drive nails 
can make it. If laths are not to be had, strips of boards will do as 
well. 

Now for a place to keep them in the house conveniently, that 
the fruit will continue to dry during nights and stormy days. To effect 
this we constructed a frame represented in the engraving. Posts two 
inches square with strips about one inch square nailed across, far 
enough apart to admit a rack between them, and braced as represented 
in the cut, A frame to hold twenty racks can be made for a dollar, 
and not weigh over twenty pounds. This we set near the kitchen stove 
against the wall, out of the way and occupying the space of a good sized 
bureau, having over one hundred square feet surface of drying racks 
holding four or five bushels of apples or other fruit. 



FRUITS. 25 

Our experience in tlie use of dried fruit is that the quicker it is dried 
the tetter it retains its flavor. Keepings off flies, wasps, &c., for cleanli- 
ness is of great importance. A few yards of musquito bars is sufficient 
to cover a large surface and prevent drying very little. 



RECIPES FOR COOKING- FRUIT. 



Baked Apples. — The hest baking apples are moderately tart, or very 
juicy, sweet^ones. The former, of ordinary size, will bake in about 
thirty minutes ; the latter in about forty-five minutes. Select, for 
baking, apples of nearly equal size ; wipe them dry and clean ; put 
a very little water in the bottom of the baking vessel, and place them 
in a hot oven. 

Stewed Green Apples. — Apples for stewing should be well flavored 
and juicy. Sweet apples, when stewed, turn more or less dark colored, 
and hence do not appear as well as tart ones at the table, though somo 
persons prefer them. Pare, core, and quarter ; put a little water to 
them, and boil moderately till soft, and add sufficient sugar to suit 
taste — more or less, according to the acidity of the fruit. Some cooks 
flavor them with lemon ; others with a small portion of peaches or 
other fruit. Good apples, however, are good enough in and of them- 
selves. 

Boiled Apples. — Select round, mellow apples of uniform size ; pare 
them ; boil in as little water as possible, till soft ; put them in a vege- 
table dish ; and slowly pour over them a syrup, made by dissolving 
half a pound of sugar in a pint of boiling water. 

Stewed Pippins. — A rich apple sauce is made as follows : Peel, core, 
and quarter half a dozen ribstone pippins ; put them into a pan with 
six OTinces of brown sugar, the juice of a lemon, its thin rind cut into 
strips, and very little water ; stew over a very slow fire till quite tender. 

Pears. — Pears may be baked, boiled, or stewed in the same manner 
as apples. Some varieties of small, early, and sweet pears are very 
delicious, boiled whole without paring, and sweetened with syrup. 
The large pears are usually selected for baking. 

Boiled Peaches. — They should be pared — except when the skins 
are very smooth, clean, and tender — but not stoned ; boiled moderately 
till sufficiently cooked, and then sweetened. 

Stewed Dried Peaches. — Most of the dried peaches in our markets 
are sour and unpleasant. But when we can find them of good quality, 
they are very excellent stewed and sweetened, precisely like dried 
apples. 

Uncooked Peaches. — When we have peaches as good and ripe as all 
peaches ought to bo, the best way to prepare them is this : Peel them ; 
cut the fruit off the stones in quarters, or smaller pieces ; fill the dish ; 
stir in a little sugar, and sprinkle a little more over the top 

Apricots. — Eipe apricots may be prepared in the same way as pcaehe^, 
but tlioy are best with no preparation at all. 



26 FRUITS. 

Chermes.— Stewing is the only proper mefhod for cooking this fruit. 
Remove tlie stalks from the cherries ; pick them over carefully, reject- 
ing all unsound ones ; put thenf into a pan, with a very little water, and 
sugar in the proportion of ahout three ounces to a pound of cherries ; 
simmer them slowly over the fire, shaking the pan round occasionally 
till done. If a richer article is wanted, take the cherries out with a 
colander spoon, and keep them in a hasin till cold ; reduce the sweet- 
ened water to the consistency of syrup, and put it over the cherries. 

Quinces. — It has heen said that quinces commend themselves more to 
the sense of smell than taste ; hence are better to " adorn" other prepar- 
ations than to be prepared themselves. When stew5d till quite tender, 
and sweetened, they are, however, a very pleasant, yet rather expensive 
kind of sauce. In the form of marmalade, they are a better seasoning for 
bread, cakes, or puddings, than butter. 

Quince Marmalade. — Pare, core, and quarter the quinces ; boirthem 
gently, uncovered, in water, till they begin to soften ; then strain them 
through a hair sieve, and beat, in a mortar or wooden bowl, to a pulp; 
add to each pound of fi'uit three quarters of a povmd of sugar ; boil 
till it becomes stiff, and pour into small molds or sweetmeat pots. 

.Stewed Cranberries. — Wash and pick the berries ; stew them in 
just as little water as will prevent their burning, till they become soft ; 
then add half a pound of sugar to a pound of the fruit, and simmer a 
few minutes. 

Blackberries. — When very ripe and sweet, a little sugar dusted 
over them is a sufficient preparation for the table. If sour, or not quite 
ripe, they should be stewed till soft, and moderately sweetened. The 
same rules apply to all berried fruits for which recipes are not given. 

Whortleberries. — Many prefer these uncooked and unseasoned. 
If stewed, however, they require but very little sweetening. 

Raspberries. — Red raspberries are never fit to be eaten till ripe, 
and then they require neither sugar nor cooking. Black raspberries, 
when quite ripe, are also best in a " state of nature." If not entirely 
ripe, they may be stewed a few minutes, and sweetened with a very 
little sugar or molasses. 

Currants. — Green currants, when half or two-thirds grown, are more 
mild flavored and pleasant than when fully ripe ; nor do I find them 
often disagreeing with ordinary dyspeptics. They require stewing but 
a short time, and moderately sweetening. The best currants, when 
quite ripe, may be eaten uncooked, with a sprinkling of sugar. 

Plums. — These must be managed according to their character and 
flavor. Many varieties are too sour to be eaten without stewing, and 
the addition of considerable sugar. Some kinds, however, are sweet and 
luscious enough to require neither. 

Grapes. — Good, ripe, well-cultivated Delawares, Isabellas, and Ca- 
tawbas are incomparably superior in dietetic character, without "the 
interference of art." What a blessing it would be to the human race 
if all the vineyards in the world were made to supply wholesome food 
for children, instead of pernicious poison for adults ! 

Pineapple. — The only way of preparing this fruit, which, like some 
others, has more flavor than taste, is that of paring, slicing, and sprink- 
ling with sugar. 



FRUITS. 27 

Tomatoes. — Scald the tomatoes by pouring "boiling water on them ; 
peel off the skins ; then stew them for an hour, and add a little slightly- 
toasted bread. This is an excellent sauce for Hygienic tables ; and 
the fruit may be improved in flavor by Btewing half an hour, or even 
an hour longer. 

Boiled Apples. — Select rich, fair, sweet apples of uniform size — the 
Tallman Sweeting is the best for this purpose. Leave the skins on 
them, merely removing the blossom ends with a sharp pointed knife. 
Wash them thoroughly, place them in a porcelain kettle and sprinkle 
over them a small quantity of sugar. Then add boiling water barely 
sufficient to cover them and cook slowly till tender. 

Prunes. — Prunes should be thoroughly washed, then soaked in just 
water enough to cover them, for an hour or two before cooking. Add 
sugar sufficient to sweeten them, and stew slowly till tender. 

Cider Apple Sauce. — Take six quarts sweet apples quartered and 
cored, pour over them one and one-half pints boilini? water, and cook 
slowly. When about one third done add one-half cup sugar and 
three-fourths of a pint of boiled cider or apple syrup, and cook till 
they can be pierced easily with a fork. 

Note. — These proportions make a macli better sauce than where more boiled cider 
is used. We wish this dish might be brought into more general use. If properly 
cooked it is excellent. Every one in the country knows how boiled cider is made, but 
every one in the city is not supposed to, from the fact that it is a commodity rarely met 
with in the city markets. It is made by taking new, sweet cider fresh from the press, 
and boiling it down till it is about the consistency of common molasses. It is more 
wholesome than sugar, and added to apples in this way it is much more palatable. 

Strawberries. — Cooking deteriorates strawberries more than any 
other kind of fruit. If cooked at all they should be simply sweetened 
and stewed. 

Stewed Dried Apples. — Select rich, mellow, flavored fruits, which 
are clear from dark spots or mould. Wash and pick the pieces, boil 
in just water enough to cover them over a slow fire, till partially soft- 
ened ; then add sugar or molasses and continue the boiling till done. 

Dried Grapes. — Dried grapes and dried apples, in the proportion 
of one-third of the former to two-thirds of the latter, make excellent 
sauce for the spring months. 

Any kind of dried fruit, cherries, raspberries, peaches, quinces, &c., 
may be cooked with dried apples, and form quite a pleasing variety. 

Whortleberry Cracker Sauce. — Stew whortleberries till quite soft, 
making them a little sweeter and more juicy than usual. As soon as 
they are done cover the bottom of a porcelain kettle or strong stone jar 
with a layer of Dr. Trail's crackers, and cover them completely with 
the sauce, then add another layer of crackers, then more sauce, and so 
on till you have as much as you wish. Let them soak over night, and 
you have a very fine dish for breakfast. It should be as juicy as com- 
mon sauce when ready for the table, therefore it is necessary to add 
much more water than iisual to the berries, when cooking. 

Apple sauce prepared in this way is esteemed very nice by many. 



VEGETABLES. 



Boiled Potatoes.— -Wasli the potatoes witliout cutting them ; put 
them in boiling water, with not more of water than is sufficient to 
cover them ; boil moderately until they are softened so that a fork 
will readily penetrate them ; pour off the water and let them stand till 
dry. Young potatoes of medium size will cook in about twenty-five 
minutes; old potatoes require double that time. When peeled they 
will cook in about half the time. All who would have potatoes well 
cooked must observe the following particulars : Always take them out 
of the water the moment they are done. Ascertain when they are done, 
by pricking with a fork, and not leave them to crack open. When 
cooked in any way, they become heavy and " watery " by cooking them 
after they are once softened through. They should be selected of an 
equal size, or the smallest should be taken up as fast as cooked. 
Potatoes should never be boiled vcrij hard, as it is apt to break them ; 
nor should the water stop boiling, as it will tend to make them 
" watery." Old potatoes are improved by soaking in cold water several 
hours or over night, before cooking. They should never remain cov- 
ered after having been roasted or boiled, to keep them hot. 

Mashed Potatoes. — Pare and wash the potatoes ; drop them into 
water which is boiling very hard ; let them boil moderately till done. 
As soon as they will pierce easily with a fork, pour off the water, place 
them over the fire again for a couple of minutes till perfectly dry, then 
mash them till they are entirely free from lumps. If any seasoning is 
desired, a little rich milk or sweet cream is all that is sufficient. 

Browned Mashed Potatoes. — Prepare the same as mashed potatoes 
above ; turn them immediately into a deep platter or diipping pan, 
smooth them evenly and place in a hot oven till browned. 

Potato Bales. — Take mashed potatoes, either cold or hot, and form 
them into small round cakes of three-fourths of an inch in thickness. 
Place them in a hot oven, and let them remain till well bro^\Tied. 

Stewed Potatoes. — Cut cold boiled potatoes into thin slices, cover 
with milk or diluted sweet cream, and stew slowly till warmed through. 

Chopped Potatoes. — Place cold boiled potatoes in a wooden bowl ; 
chop them with a chopping knife till very fine ; turn them into a deep 
platter ; add milk till they are nearly covered, and bake in a moderately 
not oven half an hour ; stir them occasionally at first, then let a nice 
brown crust form upon them. 

Bsowned Potatoes. — Cut cold boiled potatoes into slices one-third 
of an inch in thickness ; lay them on a platter in a hot oven till both 
sides are moderately browned.

the heads open and lay tliem in halves in vegetable dishes, and cover 
with a sauce made with boiling milk, thickened with flour wet with 
cold milk, and boiled till well cooked. 

Greens. — Spinach, beet tops, cabbage-sprouts, mustard leaves, turnip 
leaves, cowslips, dandelions, and deerweed are all excellent for greens. 
They all require to be carefully washed and cleaned. Spinach should 
be washed repeatedly.. All the cooking requisite is boiling till tender, 
and drain on a colander. Lemon juice is the only admissible seasoning. 

Boiled Beet Root. — Wash the roots carefully ; avoid scraping, 
cutting or breaking the roots, as the juice would escape and the flavor 
be injured ; put them into a pan of boiling water ; let them boil one 
or two hours according to size ; then put them in cold water and rub 
ofi" the skin with the hand, and cut them in neat slices of uniform 
size. Good beets are sweet enough intrinsically, and need no seasoning. 

Note.— Beet root must not be probed with, a fork, as are potatoes. "When done, the 
thickest part will yield to the pressui-e of the fingers. 

Baked Beets. — Wash the roots clean, and bake whole till quite 
tender ; put them in cold water ; rub ofl" the skin ; if large, cut them in 
round slices, but if small, slice them lengthwise. If any seasoning is 
insisted on, lemon juice is the most appropriate. When baked slowly 
and carefully, beet root is very rich, wholesome, and nutritious. It 
usually requires baking four or five hours. 

Stewed Beets. — Take baked or boiled beet root, pare and cut it into 
thin slices ; simmer in milk or diluted sweet cream fifteen minutes, 
and thicken the gravy with a little wheaten flour. 

String Beans. — When very young, the pods need only to be clipped, 
cut finely, and boiled till tender. When older, cut or break off the 
ends, strip off the strings that line their edges ; cut or break each pod 
iuto three or four pieces, and boil. When made tender, a little cream 
or milk may be simmered with them a few minutes. 

Asparagus. — Put the stalks in cold water ; cut off all that is very 
tough; tie them in bundles; put them over the fire and 'let them boil 
fifteen to twenty-five minutes, or until tender without being soft. No 
one has a right to desire a better vegetable than this with no other 
preparation than boiling. It should be cooked soon after being picked, 
or kept cool and moist in a cellar till wanted. 

Stewed Asparagus. — Cut the tender parts of the stalks into pieces 
of half an inch in length. Wash them ; put them in enough boiling 
water to cook them without burning, and when nearly done add a 
small quantity of sweet cream or milk thickened with flour. 

Stewed Cucumbers. — Pare and cut them into quarters, taking out the 
seeds ; boil like asparagus ; serve up with toasted bread and sweetcrcam. 

Vegetable Marrow. — Peel the marrows ; cut them in halves ; scrape 
out the seeds; then boil about twenty minutes, or imtil soft; drain 
them, wash them, add a little milk or cream, and simmer a short time. 

Salsify (Oyster Plant). — Scrape the vegetable ; cut it in strips; 
parboil it ; then chop it up with milk and a little sweet cream, and 
simmer gently till cooked very tender. 

Broccoli. — Peel the stalks, and boil them fifteen minutes ; tie the 
Ehoots into bunches; add a little milk or cream and stew gently for 
ten minutes. 



WHOLE GRAINS AND SEEDS. 



Boiled Wheat. — Select fair, plump wheat; pick it over carefully 
arxd wash it perfectly clean. Let it soak in cold water twenty-four 
hours. Boil it in th-^ same water (adding- more if necessary) till per- 
fectly soft. It will require several houi-s to cook it. It may be eaten 
with milk, or cream, or sugar, or without any of these, as preferred. 

Boiled Eice. — Be cai-eful and select for this purpose the large, 
plump kernel called he ml- rice ; boil it in pure, soft water and in a 
covered vessel about twenty minutes, stii-ring- it gently occasionaliv ; 
then set it off from the hre, and in a place just wai'm enough to sim- 
mer; let it remain an hour and a half witlwut stirring ; the grains 
may then be taken out full and unbroken. 

Note. — The hesl method of cookmg rice is to cover it ■well with water and set it in 
a moucrate oven, stirriugit occasionally. "Vv'hon nearly done and the water mostly ab- 
sorbed, milk or sweet cream may be added if desired, making a very rich dish. 
Or the water may be omitted and it may be c-ooked entirely in roilk, using the same 
proportions of milk and rice as for a puddrnj;-, but omitting the sugar. 

Another excellent method of cooking rice is by steaming it. A 
double boiler, commonly called a "Farina Boiler," is best for this 
purpose, but if none can be had a tightly covered tin pan, set over a 
kettle of boiling water, will answer. 

Eics AND Apple. — When the rice is about one-third cooked add 
a small quantity of tart apples sliced. When done, stir thoroughly 
together. If cooked in steam, this is a very nice dish. 

Eice and Eaisins. — An excellent dessert is made by adding one cup 
of raisins to three cups of rice and cooking in the ordinary manner, 
either in water or in equal parts of water and milk ; or, if cooked by 
steam, it is delicious if cooked entirely in milk. To bo eaten with 
sweetened cream or a sauce made by thickening boiling milk with com 
starch and adding sugar to suit the taste. 

Barley.- — The common white or pearl barley is excellent, if cookcxl 
in the same manner as boiled wheat. Milk may be added when nearly 
done, if desired. It does not require cooking so long as the wheat. 

Parched Corn. — Procure a wire apparatus called a " corn pepper." 
They can be bought at almost any hardware store for a mere trifle. 
The common " Tucket " corn is best for popping. Have the com thor- 
oughly dry. Place a large spoonful in the "popper," and pass it back 
and forth very quickly across the top of a red hoc stove till done. Ta^o 
minutes will suilice to produce a quart of great white kernels, as deli- 
cious as ever were oaten.

82 WHOLE GRAINS AND SEEDS. 

Boiled Chestnuts. — Boiled chestnuts, if made a part of our regular 

meals, are not only very delicious but perfectly wholesome. They 
should he first picked over very carefully and washed, then boiled 
fi'om an hour to an hour and a half. 

Dried Beans. — Pick the beans over carefully, wash them perfectly 
clean, cover them about three inches deep with cold water, and let 
them soak all night. Early in the morning place them over the fire, 
leaving upon them all the water that may remain unabsorbed and 
adding enough more to cook them in. Let them simmer slowly all 
the forenoon, but do not allow them to boil. When done, if any 
seasoning is desired a little sweet cream is sufl&cient. To bake them, 
take them from the fire about an hour before they are done, place them 
immediately in a deep pan, and bake one hour in a very hot oven. 

Note. — Those who -will try this method will be surprised to find how much superior 
it is to the ordinary way of cooking them. 

Dried Peas — Are cooked precisely in the same manner as beans. 

Boiled Green Peas. — Washing green peas seems to extract much 
of their sweetness. If care be taken in shelling them they will not 
need washing. Immediately after shelling them put in boiling water 
sufficient to cover them, and boil from twenty to thirty minutes. 
When the pods are fresh and green, if they are washed and boiled 
in as little water as will cover thom for fifteen or twenty minutes, 
and the juice added to the peas, it will improve the flavor. Sweet 
milk or cream is the only admissible seasoning. 

Boiled Green Beans. — The common garden, kidney, and Lima beans 
are all excellent dishes prepared by simply boiling till soft without de- 
stroying the shape of the seed. A little milk or cream may be stirred in, 
when they are cooked sufficiently, if any seasoning is desired. They 
usually require boiling an hour and a half. 

Boiled Green Corn. — The only com fit for boiling green is the 
sweet or evergreen corn. It should be simply husked, the silk re- 
moved and the ears plunged into boiling water and boiled from one- 
half to three-quarters of an hour. 

Stewed Corn. — Cut the com from the cob, boil it in just water 
enough to prevent burning. When done, add a little rich milk or 
sweet cream and a trifle of sugar. 

Succotash. — The best materials for succotash are sweet corn and 
Lima beans. Cat the com from the cobs, and when the beans have 
been cooking about three quarters of an hour add it to them, letting it 
cook about three-quarters of an hour longer. This is a dish "fit for a 
king." If any one desires a richer article, a little sweet cream may be 
added. 



CANNED GBAINS, SEEDS, AND TOMATOES. 



Green corn cut from the cob, green peas, green beans, (botb Lima 
and common,) string beans, etc., may be canned by first tborougbly cook- 
ing in just water enough to cover them ; then sealing in tin cans. 

Green peas, beans, etc., may also be dried by first dropping them into 
boiling water, and letting them boLl for two or three minutes, then draining 
and placing them where they will dry qiticMy. They are very nice when 
preserved in this way. I have eaten dried peas in June that I could not 
believe were not fresh from the garden, untH I had been repeatedly 
assured that such was not the case ; ^and when canned they are even nicer 
than when dried. 

Tomatoes are canned by scalding, peeling, and cooking them as for the 
table ; then putting up and sealing in the same manner as fruit cans are 
sealed. The secret of success in canning tomatoes is to kcc2? them boiling 
from the time they begin to bubble up tiQ put in the can. If allowed to 
cook awhile and then to partially stop boiling, or if cooked too long, they 
are apt to have a slightly bitter taste. If not cooked enough they wiU 
not keep well ; but if pared, put inunediately over the fire, and the boil- 
ing continued for a full hour after it begins, then put up immediately, 
they may be canned without the slightest diOiculty ; and will not only 
keep perfectly, but will be just as sweet and fresh as when first picked 
from the vines. If persons living in the country, who have the fresh 
materials for these things so profusely scattered around them, could but 
realize how delicious a dish of tomatoes, green peas, or succotash tastes in 
January or May, I think they would take much more pains than they 
now do to have their tables supplied with them.

MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 



Cream Cake. — One pint sweet cream, one teacnpful white sugar, one 
cup English currants, Graham flour for a thin hatter. Bake in muffing 
rings, or in gem tins ; filling the latter only half full. 

This is very nice, and is a near approach to a stricchj hygienic cake. 

Steamed Bread. — Make mush as for the tahle — Graham, hominy, or 
corn meal mush as preferred. "When cool, to one quart add one pint of 
hot, hoiled potatoes mashed through a collander, half a cup of molasses, 
one tea-cup of hoiling milk, and equal parts of Indian meal and Gra- 
ham or rye floiu- sufficient to make a rather soft dough. Place it in a 
deep hasin or pan ; smooth it evenly over the toj) ; cover it tightly and 
steam four hours. 

Eye and Indian Bread. — Take one part rye-meal and two parts of 
Indian ; pour hoiling water over the Indian, and stir it till the whole is 
sufficiently wet to work in the rye without adding any more water, and 
then, when ahout milk warm, work in the rye-meal. Should the dough 
he too stiff, add as much warm, hut not Ao/, water as may he necessary ; 
hake in a round iron dish from three to five hours. This hread, when 
new, or a day or two old, may he sliced and toasted ; it is very sweet 
and wholesome. The crust is apt to fall off; this may he wet in water 
and put into a stone jar with some moderately tart apples, peeled and 
sliced, nicely covering the apples with the crust ; then add a little wa- 
ter, and cover the dish with a tightly fitting cover ; set it on the stove 
till the apples are cooked, and then take the crust off into plates ; sweet- 
en the apples to suit the taste, and spread it over the crust. This is an 
excellent dish, if care has heen taken to prevent hurning the crust. 

Oatmeal Cake. — Mix fine oatmeal into a stiff dough with milk- warm 
water ; roll it to the thinness almost of a wafer ; hake on a griddle or 
iron plates placed over a slow fire for three or four minutes ; then 
place it on edge hefore the fire to harden. This will he good for 
months, if kept in a dry place. 

Snow Bread. — Put into a hasin or pan fresh Indian-meal and two or 
three times its hulk of snow ; stir thoroughly together and try a little 
of the mixture on a hot griddle ; if too dry, add more snow ; if too moist, 
add meal. Y/hen just right, pour it into a deep pan, rounding it up in 
the middle ahout two inches thick, and cook from twenty minutes to hali 
an hour in a hot oven. This, if properly made, is very light and nice.

APPENDIX. 



In the foregoing pages are given -the principa,! recipes for strictly 
hygienic cookeiy, such as are used upon the patients' table of the 
Hygienic Institute. To accommodate, however, that large class of 
persons, who desire a diet comparatively plain, and yet dislike to dis- 
pense entirely with all kinds of seasonings, I subjoin the following. 
They are, a part of them, such as are used upon our hoarders' table, and 
compared with the rich cakes and pastry in common use may be con- 
sidered quite physiological. 

Fine Flour Gems. — Gems made of fine flour in the same manner 
as of Graham, the batter being rather stiffer, however, say about like 
ordinary bread sponge, and baked in the gem -tins, are as light, and 
far sweeter, than any soda biscuit, and by all who have ever tasted 
them are pronounced the most delicious bread that ever was eaten. 

Puffs. — One pint sweet milk, three e^^s, twelve heaping tablespoon- 
fuls of fine flour. Beat the eggs thoroughly, make a smooth paste of the 
flour and part of the milk, add the eggs and the remainder of the milk, 
and bake in the gem-tins in a quick oven. 

Corn Bread. — One quart sour milk, one quart com meal, one eg^, 
one teaspoonful soda, one heaping tablespoonful butter. 

Corn Bread No 2. — One pint sweet milk, one pint Graham flour, one 
pint com meal, one tablespoonful sweet cream, one tablespoonful molas- 
ses, one-half teaspoonful cream tartar, one-fourth teaspoonful soda. 

Corn Bread Xo 3. — Take one pint sweet milk, a heaping iron spoon- 
ful of wheat flour, two large spoonfuls of Indian meal, one teaspoonful 
soda, two teappoonfuls cream tartar; bake in pie tins. It should be no 
stiffer than will pour out in the pans easily. 

Corn Bread No 4. — One pint of com meal, one quart milk; boil the 
milk and scald the meal thoroughly ; beat up three eggs ; thin your dough 
to a batter with cold milk ; add a piece of butter half as large as an egg ; 
put in your eggs, with a little salt, pour in shallow pans, and bake brown. 

Pie Crust. — Take equal parts of com meal, Graham flour and whJte 
fiour, mix thoroughly with butter in the ratio of one cup of butter to 
nine pies ; wet with water. 

Pie-plant or Rhubarb Pie. — Peel and cut the rhubarb in small 
pieces ; then pour boiling water upon it, and placing it where it will keep 
hot, let it stand twenty minutes ; drain off the water, fill your crust and 
sweeten to taste.

APPENDIX. 41 

Pumpkin Pie. — Stew your pumpkin slowly and for a long time as this 
makes the flavor richer ; sti-ain nicely through a collander, mix (not very 
thin) with milk and add one egg for each two pies; sugar to taste. Squash 
prepared in a similar manner is preferable to pumpkin. 

Custard Pie. — Four eggs, a quart of milk, sugar to taste. 

EiCE Pie. — "Wash nicely two cups of rice, boil it in milk, then add to 
it nine eggs, six quarts milk, and sugar to taste.

with a little milk, added by degrees until it is the thickness of cream — 
put it into a buttered dish and bake three-quarters of an hour; or if

over night, keep it wet till time for use, then simmer the water all out 
of it ; add the milk and other ingredients, and cook as above. 

Rock Cream. — This will be found a very ornamental as well as a 
delicious dish for the supper table. Boil a teacupful of the best rice 
till quite soft in new milk, sweeten it with powdered loaf sugar, and 
pile it up on a dish. Lay on it in different places square lumps of 
jelly or preserved fruit of any kind ; beat up the whites of five eggs, 
with a little powdered sugar, and flavor with orange flower water or 
vanilla. Add to this, when beaten very stifl', about a tablespoonful of 
rich cream, and drop it over the rice, giving it the form of a rock of 
snow. 

Apple Charlotte. — Take two pounds of apples, pare and core them, 
slice them into a pan, add one pound of loaf sugar, the juice of three 
lenions, and the grated rind of one. Let these boil until they become 
a thick mass which will take about two hours. Turn it into a mould, 
and serve it with thick custard or cream. 



APPENDIX. 45 



All kinds of vegetables are cooked for tlie boarders' table as indicated 
in the recipes given in tbe fore part of this book, and are seasoned just 
before they are served with salt and butter ; not more than a third the 
usual quantity employed in ordinary cooking being used. 

In baking beans the salt and butter are added when they are placed 
in the oven. 

Asparagus is cooked in pure water, taken out in vegetable disbes, 
and a gravy made of butter, flour and milk poured over it. 

As cleanliness is next to godliness, a knowledge of the easiest, surest, 
and most economical way of following in regard to clothing the injunc- 
tion to be cleanly, will not come amiss. The subjoined directions and 
recipes are taken from " The Laundry Manual," a little work by Mr. 
A. Holland, an experienced launderer. It sbould be in the hands of 
every housekeeper, as the information it contains is invaluable.* 

" Soaking Clothes. — Whatever method of washing is adopted, pre- 
viously soaking the clothes to be washed is useful; put the clothes to 
Boak in lukewarm soap suds strong enough to r^ise a good lather by 
stirring the linen after it is put in, which should bo done in some way 
till a good lather is produced. Sufficient water should be used to cover 
tbe linen without crowding it much, and tbe tub should be covered 
with a rug or clotb to keep the water warm as long as possible ; after 
soaking two or three hours, or longer if convenient, the clothes should 
be taken out and rinsed in warm water to remove the loosened dirt be- 
fore they are boiled. In this way much labor is saved as well as the 
wear of the linen. 

Half an hour will do very well for soaking linen that is not much 
soiled, but when convenient it is better to let it soak longer. It is a 
good practice to put in soak on the afternoon previous to washing-day, 
and let it soak over night. 

Soft water is of itself a good solvent, even of the oily materials that 
collect upon linen worn in contact with the body, but time is required to 
effect the solution. Every one is aware of the effect of keeping the 
hands or feet moist for a few hours — the entire external coating of 
secretion is dissolved. The same ellect is produced by soaking for a 
few hours linen soiled by the excretory matter of the skin. If a little 
soap is rubbed on such parts as are the most soiled before putting in 
soak, and the linen allowed to soak from twelve to twenty-four hours, 
cold water will answer very well for soaking it in ; but soaking linen 
in lukewarm water, having a little soap dissolved in it, is by far the most 
effectual method. Care must be taken, however, if the linen be stained, 
not to have the water much, if any, warmer than blood-heat, or it will set 
in the stains. 

To save soap when the water is at all hard and will not make a lather, 
a portion of soda may be added to the lukewarm water : the best way 
of using it is to have a jug at hand, with the soda dissolved in water, and 
to add so much of it as is necessary to render the water soft ; the quan- 
tity must be determined by experience; if too much is used it will

exliibit its eHects upon the hands of the operiitor. When hard soap is 
used this should be dissolved in boiling- water before it is added, in order 
to prevent any unnecessary delay in waiting for it to dissolve. 

The American AgriculUirist asserts that "the great secret of the suc- 
cess of nine out of ten of all the washing fluids, mixtures and machines 
which have been sold over the country for many years past, is j) wing- 
in a great measure to the process of soaking which they invariably 
recommend." 

" Boiling Clothes. — The next operation after soaking is boiling the 
clothes, and the water used for this purpose should be thus prepared : 
'To ten or twelve gallons of water add half a pint of good soft soap and 
six ounces of sal soda, or, half a pound of sal soda and six ounces of good 
bar soap, and when the water is nearly or quite boiling hot and the soap 
and soda are entirely dissolved, put in the clothes ; let them boil for 
twenty or thirty minutes, then, in order to produce a good color and to 
remove the soap and soda that have been used, which, if left in, would 
occasion a disagreeable smell, take them out — preserving the suds, as 
it can be used two or three times — and put them into a tub of clear, 
boiling water ; then, after they have scalded for a few minutes, look 
them over carefully, and if you find any dirt, it can be easily washed out 
icithout the use of a washhord. Then rinse them in clear water, warm or 
cold, and they will be as white as snow. 

Should the clothes to be washed require more or less than ten gallons 
of water to boil them in, more or less of the soap and soda can be used in 
proportion, or if the clothes are not much soiled, the water can be in- 
creased to twelve or fifteen gallons without using- any more of the com- 
pound, provided the soap is good.* 

Clothes washed by this method require no rubbing before they are 
boiled ; for if the dirt does not come out by boiling, it will come out 
much more readily after boiling than before. The object of soaking the 
clothes is to remove the loose dirt, and thus keej) it out of the boiling- 
suds. Should the wristbands or bindings of shirts be very dirty, it may 
be well to rub a little soap on such parts when they are put in soak. This 
is all the rubbing about the whole washing, unless the clothes are very 
dirty, or there are any bad stains, which it may also be well to rub with 
soap before boiling. 

I5y this method the finest linens, cambrics, laces, etc., can be readily 
and easily cleansed, and the coarsest, and dirtiest clothes readily and 
easily washed ; and the assertion can be safely made, that it is the best 
and easiest mode of washing ever discovered. It certainly saves all the 
laborious rubbing, and enables one to complete a heavy wash in a few 
hours, and with very little fatigue. "Washing-day is too often a day of 
"wretchedness, ill-temper, and gloom. Everything is upset ; the house is 
all disorder, and damp and ill-temper rule over slop and confusion. 
iSToNv, if washing be a necessity, duty should make it pleasant ; and the 
very sight of the clean white things, fluttering on the lines in the yard, 
should impart to the task a comfortable homeliness. We have tried 
many of the plans proposed to lighten the labor of washing-day. One 
plan promised to enable a housewife to complete a fortnight's wash in a 
few hours, at a cost of only five cents, and without hard labor ; but in 



* Poor dark-colored resin soap ■will not do. Any good -wliite, or the best quality of 
bro'WTi soap, may be used. The less resin there is in soap the better ; but the bro\vn or 
yellow soap is fi-equently so larp:ely adulterated with it, that it can easily be detected by 
its UTimistakable odor. A s:ood way to examine soap, is to rub a small piece between 
*be thumb and finger ; if poor, it will have a disagreeable, dirty, or sticky feeling. 



APPENDIX. 47 

our liands it proved a complete failure, and we have found hy experience 
that tlie use of the atove recipe is th.e best fi-iend to the washer- woman 
ever invented. By it one person can do the washing- for a family of 
ten or fifteen persons before breakfast, have the clothes out to cby, and 
the house kept in good order, and the gentlemen of the family, as well as 
all about the house, fi-ee from washing-day annoyances, and all without 
rubbing or machinery. Who would not wish to have such comforts ? 

Clothes should be divided into two or more parcels before boiling, as 
the dirtiest and most greasy ones ought not to be boiled with those of 
finer fabric containing less dirt. The finer, cleaner clothes can be boiled 
i-rst, or the water for boiling the clothes in can be divided into as many 
pai-ts as you have parcels of clothes, and thus boil each parcel in its 
proper time. 

It would be well if house-keepers would always keep dirty clothes thus 
separated till washing-day, instead of throwing them helter-skelter into 
one pile or bag; for the foul air arising from the dirtiest, gTeasiest 
clothes, always injures the finer ones, and makes them more difficult to 
whiten. When put in soak before washing they should be separated. 

Soiled or foul linen ought not to remain long unwashed, as the dirt is 
then more difficult to be removed. Some families wash only once a 
month, but once a fortnight would be better ; in the meantime, as just 
observedj the various articles as they are soiled, should be put aside tiU 
washing-day with method, instead of being thi'own together in a heap. 
What has been used in the kitchen and other offices should be kept 
separate, being generally greasy, or otherwise very foul ; and, as nothing 
is more unwholesome, or more apt to injure the air of a house than 
collections of foul towels, or rags of any kind, these should, if possible, 
be kept in som.e out-house. 

Bleaching Liquor.— Chloride of lime five parts ; sal soda six parts ; 
boiling water ha,lf as many gallons as you have oimces of chloride of 
lime; put the lime into any convenient vessel, and pour about two 
thirds of the water on it ; let it stand five or ten minutes, stirring it 
well ; then add the soda ; after the soda is dissolved, let it stand a few 
minutes to settle, then pour ofi' the liquid, and add the rest of the water 
to the settlings ; stir it weU, then let it settle and pour off the liquid 
carefully from the dregs and strain the solution through a flannel cloth, 
or two thicknesses of new cotton cloth, carefully keeping out every par- 
ticle of settlings. This liquor is excellent for taking out mildew and 
stains as well as bleaching ; by exposure to air and light it loses its 
strength, but may be kept in well corked bottles in a dark place for any 
length of time ; it can be used several times or until it loses its strength 
by exposure to air and light ; most stains can be remo.ved by soaking 
the linen for a few minutes in the liquid, but leather 'stains in cotton 
socks require a solution stronger than the above : it may be made twice 
as strong as needed for bleaching, and some kept for removing stains, 
and when used for bleaching it can be diluted with water. 

^ Bleaching Clothes.— After the clothes have been well washed and 
rinsed, they should be soaked from three to twelve hours in the bleach- - 
ing liquid ; then rung out, scalded, rinsed and dried. Very fine goods 
should not be soaked more than one or two hom-s. If once soaking does 
not render the clothes white enough, the same process may be repeated, 
or they can remain longer in the liquor; but it is not advisable to let 
them soak over twenty-four hours without rinsing and drying, as it 
might iniure them. Soaking articles for ten or twelve hours "In this 
Iquor will take out mildew, but if there are any stains which do not 



48 APPENDIX. 

come out, tte stained parts should "be soaked for fifteen or twenty minutes 
in the same liquor twice as strong as this, and then without rinsing, the 
articles should be soaked for a fidl hour in the bleaching liquid. 

To Remove Spots of G-rease or Paikt from "Woolen Garments. 
— "Wet the spot with a few drops of benzine and rub it quickly between 
the fingers. Oil spots and stains from candle snufis, on woolen table 
covers, paint spots on garments, etc., are thus perfectly removed without 
the slightest discoloration. 

Iron Stains. — Dip the stained part in a solution of oxalic acid in 
water. The oxalate of iron thus produced, being soluble, is easily washed 
away. Ink spots may be removed in the sa^e way. 

"VVheel-grease makes a compound stain of iron. The grease may be 
taken out first with alkali, then the iron with oxalic acid. If tar has 
been used on the wheel, rub on grease or turpentine, then apply the 
alkali. 

Ink Stains. — Eecent stains of ink may be removed if before the ink 
is dry the places be washed with sweet milk ; if this does not succeed, 
rub the spots with vinegar, lemon juice or tartaric acid, and afterward 
wash it with soap and water. Ink or iron stains may also be removed 
by the bleaching liquid already described. 

Frtjit Stains. — Ammonia or spirits of hartshorn, diluted with water 
and applied with a sponge is excellent for this purpose. Dilute muri- 
atic acid, two parts water to one of acid, will fi-equently succeed. Soak 
the stained parts two or three minutes, and rinse in cold water. Some 
faint stains may be removed by sour buttermilk. Fresh fruit stains 
npon calico or similar material may be removed by dipping the stained 
portion in boiling water." 

Cleaning Hair Brushes. — It is said that soda, dissolved in cold 
water, is better than soap and hot water. The latter very soon softens 
the hairs, and the rubbing completes their destruction. Soda, having 
an affinity for grease, cleanses the brush with very little friction. 

To Take Eust out of Steel. — Eub well with sweet oil, and let the 
oil remain upon them for forty-eight hours. Then rub with leather 
sprinkled with unslacked lime, fijiely powdered, until the rust disappears. 

Indellible Ink. — No. 1. — Dissolve one ounce of Gallic acid in one 
quart soft water. 

No. 2. — Dissolve one ounce of nitrate of silver in one ounce of liquid 
ammonia. 

Dissolve half an ounce of gum arabic in half a pint of water, to which 
add the nitrate dissolved in ammonia. Moisten a small piece of sponge 
with preparation No. 1, and with it wet a place upon the garment to be 
marked, large enough on which to write the name. Dry it with a hot 
iron ; then mark it with No. 2. 

This is the very best ink I have ever tried, and anything marked with 
it can be sent to the wash within ten minutes after marking, without det- 
riment.
