Diamond Dye Cook Book. 



Soup Stock. 

Take three or four pounds of shank of beef, 
cut into small pieces, add all the bones and 
bits of cold meat you have in the house, cover 
the whole with cold water and let it stand for 
an hour or two ; then set it on the stove and 
boil several hoifrs ; then strain and set away to 
cool. When it is cool the fat may be easily 
removed ; do not have a bit of fat in it. 

This is the soup stock, and several different 
soups can be made by boiling the different 
vegetables, rice, macaroni or manicoa in water 
and adding some of the soup stock, and sea- 
soning to taste. Whenever an onion is used, 
it is much nicer grated than cut in pieces. 

White Soup. 

Strain two or three small boiled potatoes 
through a wire strainer, mix with them two 
cups of water, one and one-half cups of milk, 
and one-half cup of soup stock, if you have it. 
Season to taste with pepper, salt, and ground 
celery seed. Let it boil up once and serve. 

Asparagus Soup. 

Make a soup on the same plan as the White 
Soup. Add to this soup one-half a can of as- 
paragus, or, if in season, the tips of one bunch 
of fresh asparagus, cut in pieces one inch long 
and previously boiled in salted water. Then 
add a little cream and serve very hot. 

If canned asparagus is used, take care not 
to put in any of the liquor and use only the 
tips, or tender portion cut fine. 

Pea Soup. 

Pick over and wash one pint of split peas, 
cover with water and soak during the morning. 
Three hours before dinner put them in a kettle 
with a quart more water and a small piece of 
salt pork, boil steadily, stirring often lest it 
should burn. V you prefer to have the soup 
without pork us^ the liquor that fresh beef or 
other meat has been boiled in instead of water, 
and use no pork. It may need more water as 
it IjmIs ; you can make it of whatever thick- 
ness you prefer. 



Roast Beef. 

The best pieces for roasting are the sirloin 
and rib piece?; the latter being better for a 
small family. Remove all the bones, roll the 
meat in a tight round and skewer firmly. 1[ 
you wish the meat to be rare, allow fifteen 
minutes to a pound ; if you wish it well done, 
about twenty-five minutes to the pound. Have 
the oven very hot when the meat is first put 
in, let it cook for fifteen or twenty minutes, 
then turn one cup of boiling water over it and 
sprinkle with pepper and salt, and allow the 
oven to cool a little. Baste the meat frequent- 
ly with the water that is in the bottom of the 
" -^n that it may not get hard and dry. When 
..le meat is done remove it to a hot dish, and 
put the dripping pan on the stove to brown 
the drippings. As soon as they are brown, 
turn in two cups of boiling water and thicken 
with flour wet with cold water. Season the 
gravy to taste with pepper and salt and serve 
in a gravy-boat ; do not turn it in the dish 
with the meat. 

Stew of Beef. 

This is an old-fashioned dish, but is very 
nice if properly done. Select a nice juicy 
piece of a shank, about three or four pounds, 
cover it with boiling water and cook slowly for 
about four or five hours, or until tender, keep- 
ing it always covered with boiling water. 
When it is well cooked season to suit the taste, 
then allow it to cook until the meat is just 
ready to fall off the bone. This can be done 
the day before the stew is wanted ; it is often 
better to do so, as then there is plenty of time 
for the meat to cook. Now cut the meat from 
the bone, remove all bad parts, and put the 
meat in a frying pan with some of the water in 
which it was cooked and a piece of butter if 
there was no fat in the meat ; set it on the 
stove and allow it to brown until the meat is 
crisp on the outside j then turn in the rest of 
the water from the kettle and thicken with 
flour wet with cold water. This dish can be 
varied by cooking rice, potatoes, macaroni, 
parsnips and onions in a little water and add' 
mg to the stew.

WELLS, RICHARDSON & CO.'S 

IMPROVED BUTTER COLOR 

SPECIAL POINTS OF EXCELLENCE THAT 
M AKE IT THE MOST PERFECT COLOR. 

ist.— Butter colored with Wells, Richardson & Co.'s Improved Butter 

Color never turns a reddish or bricky tinge ; it always retains the 

lovely JUNE tint. 
2nd.— Wells, Richardson & Co.'s Improved Butter Color is as harmless 

as the natural color of butter ; it is pure and wholesome. 
3rd.— Butter colored with Wells, Richardson & Co.'s Improved Butter 

Color is perfectly free from taste or smell. 
4th.— Its keeping qualities are perfect. It does not become rancid, stale 

or sour. 
5th.— It does not color the buttermilk. The color is all absorbed by the 

butter globules, and its weight added to that of the butter. 
6th.— It is the strongest, purest and most reliable color made in the 

world. The most successful buttermakers use it.

Roast Pork. 

Cut oflT the skin and part of the fat if there 
is a good deal. Have the oven very hot when 
the pork is first put in, cook it fifteen or twenty 
minutes, then pour over it a cup of boilin? 
water, and sprinkle with sage, pepper and 
salt ; baste frequently. Cook the pork a long 
time, the more it is cooked the better it will be 
and the more healthy. Do not make a gravy, 
it is too greasy to be good. 

Yorkshire Pork Pie. 

Make a crust according to the rule for meat 
pie. Line a buttered dish with part of the 
crust, fill it with alternate layers of cold pork, 
sliced thin and seasoned with sage, pepper and 
salt, and some apples, paied and cut in thin 
slices. Pour in a little warm water or beef 
gravy, put on the top crust and bake. 

Dried Beef. 

Chip the dried beef into thin slices, cut these 
slices mto small bits and put in a frying-pan 
with enough milk to cover the bits of meat, a 
small lump of butter and a little pepper. 
Thicken this when it is boiling hot with one 
teaspoonful of cornstarch wet with a little cold 
milk. When it boils up once more stir in an 
egg well beaten. As it is often difficult to get 
the genuine dried beef, it is better to dry it 
yourself, then you are sure of it when you want 
It. This can easily be done by cutting out a 
part of the lean meat from the piece of corned 
beef that you have bought from your butcher, 
and hanging it over the stove covered lightly 
with brown paper or a cloth. From one to 
two weeks will be sufficient to dry a small 
piece of meat if there is constant fire. 

Below are given the directions for curing 
and drying the beef, for the benefit of those 
who may wish to try it ; you will surely feel 
that you have been repaid for your trouble, for 
when dried in this way it is delicious. 

To Dry Beef. 

For twelve pounds of beef, heat and rub in 
one>half cup of salt once a week for four 
weeks, the fourth time put in a little brown 
sugar and saltpetre with the salt. Keep the 
meat in a dish covered with a cloth during the 
time of salting and for a few days after the 
fourth salting, then hang it in a cold place 
wk<?r9 \i ^p freeze until it is ftosen dry, 



«> — 



Heat Balls. 

Meat that has been used in making soup Is 
not generally regarded as of much value, out 
it may be utilized by the economical house- 
keeper, and a very palatable dish made from 
it as follows: Remove the meat from the 
bones, add any scraps of cold steak or veal, a 
slice or two of breakfast bacon, three or four 
tablespoonfuls of stale bread crumbs, seasoned 
highly with pepper and salt ; chop all together 
in hash bowl or run through meat cutter ; make 
into cakes and fry in hot lard or butter ; serve 
hot. 

Beef Croquettes. 

Chop the bits of cold beef very fine ; to one 
cupful of chopped meat add one-half cup of 
cracker crumbs, one egg, mustard, ground 
celery seed, pepper and salt, and mix together j 
a little hot water or meat gravy may be needed 
to make the crumbs stick together. Make into 
little cakes and fry in a hot buttered pan. 

Oyster Stew. 

Heat one cup of milk and two cups of water 
until it is boiling ; add butter the size of an 
egg, pepper and salt ; now turn in one pint of 
fresh oysters and allow it to boil up once ; it is 
then ready to serve. 

Roast Veal. 

Remove the bones from the meat and fill the 
cavity with a dressing made of two cups of 
bread crumbs, one-half cup of chopped pork, 
season with lemon-juice, sage and pepper. 
Follow the directions for roasting beef, allow- 
ing more time as veal needs to be well cooked. 

Spiced Meat. 

Take a thin slice of round steak ; remove the 
bone, all the fat and the bits of skinny mem- 
brane on the outside. Make a dressing of one 
cup of bread crumbs, one-half cup of butter, 
mustard, pepper, salt, ground celery seed and 
spices to suit the taste, add enough hot water 
to make it soft, and spread over the meat. 
Now roll it up firmly and tie in a thin cloth, 
place the roll in a kettle and cover with boiling 
water. Boil from three to five hours according 
to the size of the roll. After it has boiled two 
hours, put in a teaspoonful of salt. When it is 
done remove the cloth, place the meat in a 
mould with a heavy weight on top. When it 
is cold it will slice nicely and m^ke ft ^ice cold| 
il)$a( fojT lunch or supper.

Tptpe. 

Take honey-comb tripo, lx)i! it until pcrfect- 
Ijr tender in salted water, put it in a bowl with 
vinegar enough to cover it, leave it for a day 
or two. Remove from the vinegar, dry with a 
clean cloth, dip in beaten egg and then in bread 
or cracker crumbs, and fry in butter. Thus pre- 
pared, tripe makes a most delicious dish. The 
pickling vinegar may be omitted and the tripe, 
when served, have a squeeze of lemon on it. 

Creamed Eggs and Bacon. 

Boil three egcs hard and cut them in slices. 
Arrange on a platter and pour over them a 
cream sauce made by stirring a teaspoonful of 
butter rolled in one of corn starch into a cup- 
ful of boiling milk, and cooking until it thick- 
ens ; season to the taste. Arrange thin slices of 
bacon fried crisp around the edge of the platter. 

Deviled Ham. 

Chop lean, boiled ham very fine. To every 
« pint of ham add one teaspoonful of mustard, 
one tablespoonfiil of flour, and one-half cup of 
boiling water. Press this mixture in a mould, 
when it is cold it will slice nicely. It is ex- 
cellent for sandwiches. 

Liver and Ham. 

I pound calf's liver. 

}i pound of ham. 

j4 cup of gravy from soup stock. 

1 cup of fine bread crumbs. 

2 eggs, well beaten. 
Minced onions and parsley. 
Pepper and salt. 

Boil the liver and ham in separate dishes, 
chop them fine, mix together, and add the soup 
stock, the seasoning and eggs. Grease a Bos- 
ton brown bread mould, put the mixture in it, 
cover tightly and cook two hours ; then turn 
out and pour a cupful of drawn butter over it. 
It is nice cold and without the drawn butter. 

Beef Fritters. 

Boil pieces of beefsteak and cold roast-beef 
until tender. Cut them into pieces about three 
inches long and one inch wide ; season with 
lemon juice, mustard, pepper, salt and ground 
celery seed. 

Have ready a batter made by beating two 
eggs light with two tablespoonfuls of sweet 
milk, one-half cup of flour and one icaspoon- 
lul of baking powder. Dip each piece of beef 
in this bailer and fry in a hot buttered pan or 
hot lard as you do fritters. 



Veal Scallop. 

Chop the pieces i>f cold veal and put the 
chopped meat in a buttered baking dish in al 
ternate layers with cracker crumbs, the same 
as in the oyster scallop. Pour a cup of the 
gravy over the whole and bake half an hour. 

Heat Souffle. > 

Make a cream sauce thus :— Melt one heap- 
ing teaspoonful of butter and stir into it a 
heaping tablespoonful of flour, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and a little pepper. Have in readi 
ness a coffee-cupful of milk in which is boiling 
a slice of onion ; remove the onion and stir the 
milk into the flour and butter. When the 
sauce is as smooth as cream add to it one cup- 
ful of finely chopped cold beef, mutton, veal, 
lamb or ham. When the whole is well heated 
draw it aside to stop its boiling ; add the beat- 
en yolks of two eggs and as soon as it is cool, 
but not cold, stir in the whipped whites of the 
eggs ; put in a buttered baking dish and bake 
twenty minutes. The onion may be omitted 
if desired. 

Spiced or Fielded Relish of Meat. 

Chop remnants of cold beef, veal or mutton 
very fine, and mix with it a quarter as much 
ham or bacon, also minced extremely fine. 
Season to taste with allspice, pepper, salt, and 
if desired, sweet herbs. Put the mixture in a 
covered dish and set this in another of boiling 
water, and cook until the meat is heated 
through. Take from the fire and press in a 
mould tightly, place a heavy weight on it. 
When cold turn out and cut in thin slices. It 
may be kept for some days by pouring melted 
suet or butter on top and setting in a cold place. 

Hamburg Steaks. 

Two pounds of lean beef, from the round, 
chopped very fine. One onion and one bunch 
ofpars'ley also chopped fine. Two eggs. Wet 
the beef with the eggs and add the seasoning. 
Form into small cakes or rolls to suit the fancy, 
sprinkling with bread or cracker crumbs and 
fry in hot butter. They are very good if pro- 
perly prepared. 

To Corn Beef. 

1 6 pounds salt, 
X " saltpetre. 
1 " brown sugar. 
4 gallons water. 

Mix these together and pour over the b^ef |

browned. They should, if baked right, be i 
creamy and nice, rising round and light like 
muffins. 

This is an excellent manner in which to dis- 
pose of the cold potatoes which one sometimes 
doesn't know what to do with. Half a cup of 
salt codfish picked fine and simmered in water 
a few minutes, then well drained, may be 
added to the potato mixture. This makes a 
nice breakfast dish and is preferred by many 
to fish-balls. 

Creamed Potatoes. 

Mash the potatoes in the usual way, but add 
more milk than ustal and beat in the whipped 
white of an egg. Mound in a pie plate and 
set in the oven for five minutes before serving. 

Fried Parsnips. 

Boil in salted water until tender, scrape off 
the skin and cut in lengthwise slices. Dredge 
with flour and fry in hot dripping or lard, turn- 
ing when one side is browned. Drain off every 
drop of fat ; pepper and serve hot. 



Parsnip Fritters. 

Boil until tender, scrape off the skin, mash 
smooth and fine, picking out the woody bits. 
For three large parsnips allow two eggs, one- 
half cup rich milk, one tablesp«x>nful butter, 
one teaspoonful salt, three tablesp(Rmfuls flour. 
Beat the egg light, stir in the mashed parsnips, 
beating hard, then the butter and salt, next 
the milk, lastly the flour. Fry as iritters or 
griddle cakes. 



Hashed Parsnips. 

Bo'l and scrape them, mash smooth with the 
back of a wooaen spoon, or what is much 
better, one of, those new TX)tato mashers, pick- 
ing out the fibres ; mix in three or four spoon- 
fuls of cream or rich milk, a sp)onful of butter, 
pepper and salt to taste. Heat to boiling and 
serve heaped in a mound as you do potato, in 
a hot dish. 

Fried ^ggr-plant. 

Slice the egg plant in slices from a quarter 
to one half an inch thick, pare each piece 
carefully and lay in salted water for an hour, 
then drain the water all off and cover the egg- 
plant with boiling water, and let it stand in a 
hot place for a few minutes. Wipe each piece 
dry and dip in beaten egg, then in cracker 
crumbs, and fry in a hot buttered pan until 
nicely browned. 

Green Corn Fritters. 

Grate the corn, allow one and a half eg^ 
and one tablespoonful of cream or milk for 
each cupful of grated corn. Beat the eggs well 
and add the corn by degrees, beating very 
hard ; add a tablespoonful of melted butter to 
each pint of corn, and salt to taste. Stir in 
the milk and thicken with just enough flour to 
hold them together — about a tablespoonful for 
every two eggs. Cook on a hot griddle like 
batter cakes, or fry in hot lard. 

Stewed Carrots. 

Scrape and lay the carrot in cold water for 
half an hour or more. Boil for three-quarters 
of an hour, drain and cut into slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick. Put in a saucepan 
with a teacupful of broth— veal, beef or mut- 
ton ; pepper and salt to taste, stew gently half 
an hour. When done, add four tablespoonfuls 
of cream or milk, a lump of b«itter and flour to 
thicken. Boil up and serve. If you have not 
the meat broth, use water or milk and more 
butter.

Homemade Carpets, Rugs 

and Mats. 



TN THE HOMES of Canada millions of pac-cages of Diamond Dyes are used 
* annually for dyeing rags and yarns for the making of homemade carpets, 
rugs and mats. 

Diamond Dyes have completely revolutionized the art of home dyeing since 
their introduction. By their use dyeing can be done in one-fourth the time, at 
much less expense, and with greater success than with the common and imita- 
tion dyes that some sell for the sake of large profits. 

For all wool rags and yarns use the Fast Diamond Wool Dyes, and for all 
cotton, or mixed cotton and wool rags and cotton warps, use the Fast Diamond 
Dyes for Cotton and Mixed Goods. 

All prize carpet and rug makers in Canada use the Diamond Dyes because 
they are the brightest, fastest and most durable.

Soap-suds Without Starting the Color. 




I 



T is but little more trouble to dye a dress 

with Diamond Dyes than to wash it, and 

the result is an absolute saving of the cost of 

new goods or the expensive charges of the dye 

house. 

With the Fast Black Diamond Dyes one 
can get a good rich black, that will not crock or 
fade, with less work and bother than by any- 
other way of dyeing. Don't risk your goods 
with any of the imitations that a few dealers try 
to sell simply because they can buy them a 
trifle less than the original Diamond Dyes. 

Goods dyed with these Fast Black Diamond Dyes can be washed in soap- 
suds without starting the color. No other black dye that can be used in the 
home equals these in strength, fastness or ease of use. Try them once and you 
will be surprised how easy it is to save money by Diamond-dyeing your old, 
faded garments rich and handsome colors. 

Be sure to o^et the wool dye when coloring woollen goods, and the cotton 
dye when coloring cotton or mixed goods, and then success is sure.

Renovating: Men's and Boys' Clothing. 

MEN'S SUITS often become faded and shabby looking before they are badly worn, and 
it becomes necessary to renovate and freshen them if they are to look presentable foK 
either Sunday or office wear. The woman who is truly economical seeks not only to 
make a garment last longer, but to preserve its creditable appearance as well, and often a little 
work will make it look like new. 

A coat, vest or pair of pants that is to be cleaned must be well brushed and dusted first. 
If there is a tear that needs mending, set the patch neatly, taking care to match the twill or 
check, and sew it down so as to make it as nearly invisible as possible. Rip out the lining of 
the coat. Iron the pieces smooth and use them for a pattern for a new lining, which may be 
cut from a good quality of farmer's satin. Remove the buttons, and if the edges are bound with 
braid that has become frayed and ragged, that should be taken off also. If the collar is badly 
soiled, lay it on the table, and scrub with a small brush dipped in strong suds made of soft water, 
soap and a little ammonia. When it is clean, rinse- with clear water. Let out the hem of the 
sleeves and the trousers, and wash each piece in hot soapsuds until clean ; then rinse through 
clear hot water, and while still wet, put them in a solution of Diamond Dyes of any color pre- 
ferred. If there are any small pieces, fasten them together, and they will be easier to handle. 
The dyeing is an easy matter despite the prevailing belief to the contrary, and is a work that 
commends itself to the practical housewife. 

The cloth of which men's suits are made is often a mixture of cotton and wool, and it is 
necessary to use the dye for cotton in coloring such goods. Navy Blue, Seal Bi^. v u imd "Jlack 
are suitable for men's clothing, and Diamond Dyes in all of these colors have bna i '.'u' ibso- 
Vtely unfading in the severest tests. They are by far the best package dyes in trt lorakv. as to 
color, durability and the ease with which they are used. Any plain goods can be re dyed the 
color it was originally, or the color may be changed to a darker one. Many pieces of mixed 
goods are so skilfully made that it is difficult to tell by their appearance that they are not all 
wool. Take out a few threads of the chain and filling, and hold them one by one over the flame 
of a lighted lamp. Cottor» burns readily, and when lighted usually burns the entire thread be- 
fore it goes out. A thread of W'.oi .'urni slowly, and gives forth a peculiar odor which is easily 
detected. A few trials will te^ j'l iu >* oh'^ bow to apply the test. 

Be sure the vessel that is u-td !■„<. dyeing is large enough to hold the material without 
crowding. Either granite or tin kettles or pans may be used, for there is nothing about these 
dyes to injure the vessel, and after the work is done it can be scoured and will be as good as it 
was before. Follow the directions on the package iu Ihs smallest details, and the result will 
always prove satisfactory

on one-fourth of the butter, now make it into 
a tight roll, like a sheet of music, and again 
roll it out and spread on another one-fourth of 
the butter, repeat this until the butter is all

2K quarts meat that has been boiled and 
chopped fine. 

5 quarts apples chopped. 

I ft. beef suet. 

i//^ lbs. raisins seeded and chopped. 



currants. 

It is impossible to give an accurate rule for 
mince pies as most of the seasoning is done to 
suit the taste of the family that is going to 
consume them. Do not chop the suet and put 
it in, rather try it out in a separate dish and 
just use the fat, or boil it with the meat. When 
the meat is done take it out of the water that 
it has been boiled in, and when it is cold it 
can be chojjped. When it is chopped add the 
apples, raisins, currants, and moisten with the 
water the meat was boiled in and the suet that 
has been removed and warmed, add one cup 
of boiled cider, one-half cup vinegar and sweet- 
en with molasses and brown sugar, season to 
taste with cloves, cinnamon, mace, nutmeg, 
allspice, salt and pepper. Cook a few minutes

Line a deep pie plate with crust, pour in 
this mixture, grate a little nutmeg over the top 
and bake in a quick oven until custard htus set. 

Apple Custard Pie. 

Beat the yolk of one egg and one -half cup 
of sugar until light and foamy, then beat in 
one cup of apple sauce that has been strained 
through a fine strainer, season to taste with 
lemon extract. Bake with an under crust in a 
quick oven. Make a meringue of the white of 
the egg, spread it over the pie as soon as it iy

raisins and sugar together, add the spices, and 
put over a slow fire. Cook the mixture until 
it is thick, about three hours, then put in jars or 
jelly tumblers, cover and keep in a cool place. 
This makes an excellent relish for meat, and

A large stone or glass jar is the best thing 
for this preserve ; one that has a tight fitting 
cork. Put in the brandy with one pint oJ 
strawberries and one pound of sugar. Stir it 
thoroughly every day. Add the other fruits 
with the sugar from time to time as they can 
be procured. The bananas should be sliced 
very thin, the stones removed from the cherries, 
and the pineapples grated fine. If kept in a 
cool place this will keep a long time. It must 
be slirred every day during the lime of putting 
in the different fruits and for several days after 
in order to dissolve the sugar and preserve the 
fruit.

DIAMOND DYE COOK BOOK. 



Orange Marmalade. 

I dozen oranges. J^ dozen lemons. 

3 quarts water. 8 pounds sugar. 

Slice the fruit very thin, cutting each slice 
into three or four pieces. Remove all of the 
seeds. Turn the water over it and let it stand 
for twenty-four hours ; then boil two or three 
hours, or until tender, add the sugar and boil 
one-half hour longer. Turn into tumblers 
and, when cold, cover as you do jelly or jam. 
Keep in a cool place. 

Raspberry Vinegar. 

Take nine quarts of berries, mash them 
somewhat and cover them with vinegar and 
let them stand twenty-four hours, then squeeze 
out the juice and add a pint of sugar to each 
pint of juice. Boil fifteen minutes and then 
bottle tightly. A pleasant drink is made by 
putting two or three spoonfuls of this vinegar 
into a glass of ice water. 

Strawberry and Rhubarb Jam. 

Take one pound of rhubarb, the nice red 
preserving stalks, wipe them clean and cut up 
as for stewing ; place it in an earthen bowl and 
strew over it one pound of sugar ; let it stand 
all night. Next day place it in the jelly pan 
with two pounds of strawberries and an addi- 
tional pound of sugar. Boil slowly for twenty 
minues, then put in air tight preserving cans. 

Gfrape Cordial. 

I gallon grapes. 

yi " water. 

Mash the grapes, add the water and simmer 
for twenty minutes. When it is cool strain 
through a jelly bag, r.nd to each quart of juice 
add one pound of sugar. Turn this into a 
large jar or crock. Toast one slice of bread 
until brown, spread one cake of yeast on it, 
and place it, yeast side down, on the top of 
the grape juice. Let it stand nine or ten days 
to ferment, then bottle and cork tightly. Be 
very careful to have the jar or crock sufficient- 
ly large as the juice, while fermenting, rises 
considerably. 

Pineapple Sherbert. 

One tablespoonful gelatine soaked in one 
cup cold water fifteen minutes. Dissolve with 
one cup boiling water. Take one-half can 
grated pineapple, one and one-half cups sugar 
and juice of one lemon. Add strained gela- 
tine, put in freezer and pack with ice and salt 
and freeze. I 



Sweet Cucumber Pickles. 

6 pounds seed cucumbers. 

I pound brown sugar. 

Vinegar. 

I tablespoonful each cloves, allspice, cinna* 
mon and pepper. 

Salt the cucumbers in layers over night. 
Drain thoroughly in the morning ; add the 
sugar and spices ; cover with vinegar and cook 
until tender.

I tablespoonful each of cloves, cinnamon 
and allspice.

4 ripe peppers. 
I large onion. 

I tablespoonful salt. 
I " sugar. 

yi cup vinegar. 

Chop the onion and peppers ; mix all to- 
gether and boil one hour. Bottle while hot. 

Preserved Pineapple. 

Pare the pineapples and grate them on i 
coarse grater instead of cutting them in slices. 
Cook over a slow fire for two hours. Make a 
thick syrup by taking three fourths of a jiound 
of sugar to every pound of fruit and sufficient 
water to moisten and boiling it until it is clear. 
Remove the scum that rises and add the syrup 
to the fruit. Cook twenty or thirty minutes 
and put in cans. 

One economical housekeeper always pares 
off the rough outside of the pineapple and 
throws it away ; she then pares them again 
and cuts out the eyes. The second paring is 
put in a saucepan, covered with water and 
cooked two or three hours. The water is then 
drained oflf, strained until clear^ and used in 
making the syrup instead of clear water. By 
doing this none of the goodness of the fruit is

Plum Catsup. 

Cook the plums and when cool put through 
a sieve to remove the skins and pits. Then to 
five pounds of plums put two pounds of sugar, 
one pint of vinegar and one teaspoonful each 
of salt, pepper, cinnamon and cloves. Boil 
twenty minutes, being careful not to burn; 
bottle and cork tightly. 

Molasses Candy, No. 1. 

To four pounds of molasses allow a dessert- 
spoonful of vinegar and half a teaspoonful of 
baking soda, the latter not to be added till just 
before it is taken from the fire. Boil slowly, 
stirring to prevent burning. After boiling 
twenty minutes try it by dropping a little in 
cold water. If it snaps it is done. Flavor 
with vanilla. Put in the soda, stirring hard, 
take off immediately and pour on buttered 
dishes. As soon as it is possible to handle it, 
take it from the dish, butter or flour the hands 
and pull it rapidly with both hands as long as 
it is possible to do so. This makes it light 
colored and tender. Confectioners use an iron 
hook driven in the wall to assist them in pull- 
ing it. When it becomes so hard that you can 
no longer work it, pull it into slender sticks 
and cut in lengths. 

Molasses Candy, No. 2. 

One cup white sugar, one cup molasses, 
one-half cup water, a teaspoonful cream tartar. 
Boil "to the snap," pull several minutes and 
cut according to directions in No. i. 

Chocolate Cream Drops, No. 1. 

For the cream, boil two cups of white sugar 
in one -half cup of milk for five minutes. Add 
one teaspoonful of vanilla, then beat till stiff 
enough to make into drops. For the choco- 
late, take three-fourths of a cake of chocolate, 
grate and moisten it with a spoonful of milk. 
Steam it over the tea-kettle. Drop the creams 
when hard, one at a time, into* the melted 
chocolate, using a fork or wire to handle them 
with. If this be done quickly they will be 
coated with the chocolate. Put them on a 
buttered dish. 

Chocolate Creams, No. 2. 

Take two cups of powdered sugar, such as 
is used for frosting, moisten it with milk or 
cream until it is right to form into small balls 
with the fingers ; flavor with vanilla. Drop 
the creams, one at a time, into melted choco- 
late and place on buttered dishes. 



Chocolate Toffy. 

One-half cake of chocolate cut fine, one cup 
of molasses, three cups of sugar, one cup of 
water, and a piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Boil till it hardens in cold water, but not so 
hard as molasses candy; add one-half tea- 
spoonful of baking soda. Pour on a buttered 
dish ; when cool pull and cut the candy. 

Fruit Candy. 

Take one pound of sugar, one-half pint of 
water, one teaspoonful cream of tartar. Boil 
till it nearly candies, then take the fruit, such as 
grapes, pieces of orange, etc., and dip into tlie 
candy while hot. They will soon become hard. 

Fig Candy. 

One pound of sugar, one pint of water. 
Boil over a slow fire. When done add a small 
piece of butter and a few drops of water and 
turn it over split figs. Do not boil as hard as 
for common sugar or molasses candy. Almond 
candy is made in the same way, by having 
split or chopped almonds spread in the buttered 
tin before turning in the hot candy. 

Cream Candy. 

Two pounds of white sugar, just enoug!i 
water to dissolve. Boil in a covered kettle or 
saucepan briskly, without stirring. When it 
begins to thicken, which will be soon, add a 
little cream of tarter. Be sure that it does not 
burn. Try by dipping a small stick into it 
and then putting quickly into cold water. If 
it breaks short and crisp it is done. Pour it 
it out on a large buttered pan or plate and 
pour over it the flavoring. When cool enough 
to handle, work it until it is white. Cut into 
flat sticks. When hard, place it in glass jars 
aud keep it for a week or ten days, when it 
will be creamy and delicious. 

Caramels, No. 1. 

Equal quantities of milk, sugar, molasses 
and chocolate. Put a little butter into a kettle 
and boil it like candy. 

Caramels, No. 2. 

One-half cup of molasses, one cup of sugar, 
one-half cup of milk, one-half spoonful of flour, 
butter one-half size of an egg, one-fourth of a 
pound of chocolate. Boil until hard, turn it 
into a panj mark into squares. 

Butter Scotch Candy. 

One cup of molasses, one cup of sugar, one* 
half cup of butter. Boil until done.

stirring together gently with a knife. After it 
has boiled for about ten minutes, ascertain if 
it is done by having ready a basin of cold 
water, and drop a little of the mixture into it 
from the point of a knife ; if it is sufficiently 
done, when you take it from the water it will 
be quite crisp. Now prepare a large, shallow

How to Make Art Colors from 

Diamond Dyes. 



Diamond Art Colors may be termed Liquid Art Colors and are used for almost all purposes 
for which the regular water colors are used. They are especially valuable for painting or color- 
ing photographs, engravings, maps, etc., also for fabric, tapestry and lustra painting, for etching 
upon Cotton or linen, dye-embroidery, etc. 

Any person gifted with taste in the arrangement of colors can quickly learn to do beautiful 
work. The colors being transparent, the lights and shadows show through them, and thereby 
most charming effects are readily produced without any special skill on the part of the user. 
After a little practice a person will acquire sufficient skill to take orders, so it will quickly prove 
to be very .remunerative. 

The colors made from the Diamond Dyes are superior to the colors sold under high sound- 
ing names at extravagant prices. With one dollar's worth of Dyes twenty times as much color 
can be made as is contained in the boxes sold for three dollars. The portion of the Dyes not 
needed for this purpose can, of course, be used for coloring any article, or for making ink, etc 

The Diamond Dyes can be bought of druggists everywhere. 

No other kind of Dyes can be used for this purpose. 

Dissolve the amount of Diamond Dye named in a quart of hot water : — 
For VIOLET, dissolve one package VIOLET DYE.

'• BLACK, " " " SLATE DYE. 

" DARK BROWN, mix one part VIOLET with three parts BROWN. 

« FLESH COLOR, mix equal parts ORANGE and CARDINAL. 

These are the principal colors, but other colors can be made from other dyes if desired. 
When one in dyeing uses any of these colors it is a good way to take as much as will lie on a 
ID cent piece of each dye used, and dissolve in a gill (4 oz.) of hot water and bottle. In this 
way one docs not have such a quantity of the color. It is, however, a good plan <o make up a 
whole package of each color, nn 1 ];cep well corked, as a glance through this little book wiU 
show ample uses for a quart of each color.

DIAMOND DYE COOK BOOK. 



To Color Photographs. 



Preparlngr the Picture, in using these coIom on Photographs it is necessary to fii^ 
wet a clean piece of cotton cloth in the mottth^ and rub the saliva over the picture thoroughly ^ 
do not leave the picture wet with saliva, but when the colors do not penetrate readily, repeat 
the welting. Do not rub hard ; if you do, it removes the albumenizcd surface of the paper. 

Preparing^ the Colors for Use. Put a teaspoonful of water in an individual butter 
dish, or any small shallow dish, and add a drop of the color you wish to use to the water by 
dipping the brush into the color, and then stirring the water with it, — add more if wanted. 
Use a separate dish for each color. Always use the color in a weak solution at first, and if a 
deeper shade is required than that which is at first produced, add the color by the drop until 
you reach the proper shade. 

When solutions are mixed in water, they should be flowed in abundance over the part you 
wish to paint, and kept in motion with the brush until the picture assumes the tint you desire. 
Always use a brush in flowing the color over the picture. After the color has laid on the picture 
long enough to give the right tint, take up the surplus with blotting paper or a fine sponge. 

Mixing the Colors. Nice effects can be got by mixing various colors before applying, 
or by first putting on one color and letting it dry, and then putting on another color over it. 

By applying magenta, and after it is dry going over it with yellow, a rich scarlet or cherry 
can be produced. Orange and cardinal make salmon, green and yellow for grass green, blue 
and yellow make green, green with a little yellow produces beautiful effects on dark drapery, 
green and brown make olive, orange and green make old gold ; many other combinations will 
suggest themselves after a few trials. For delicate blue shades add a little green to the blue. . 

Face, Eyes and Hair. A beautiful and very permanent flesh color can be made by 
mixing equal parts of orange and cardinal. It must be made very weak, as only a slight tint is 
wanted for flesh. Try it carefully and add more orange or cardinal as may be needed for the 
desired color. 

Many persons use the rose very weak for flesh color, but the color is not very permanent. 
A little orange or yellow should be mixed with it. 

If the flesh color goes on too rosy, go over it with a very weak yellow. 

After the face is washed over with the flesh color as directed, it may be tinted on the lips 
uid cheeks by using a weak rose color. This should be done very carefully. 

Blub Eyes. — Use blue, and allow it to ):en)aiQ on the pupil a few seconds, and then wi]pQ 



DIAMOND DYE COOK BOOK. || 

Brown Eyes. — Use brown on the pupil, rather strong. Apply with a small brush and let 
it remain on the picture for a few seconds, then wipe oflF with a damp cloth wet from the mouth. 

Hair. — For blonde hair use orange and yellow mixed in water ; use sparingly until yoa 
reach the shade you desire. Use brown for brown hair ; should the result turn the hair to a 
reddish color, wash the hair over with black. 

Dresses, Wraps and Draperies should be colored with care. If a dress is light 
in the photograph do not attempt to make a dark color of it ; use any shade you choose, 
but use it light in solution. After it is entirely colored in a light tint, deepen the shadows with 
same color mixed darker or else use a corresponding color. For instance, if the dress is 
lemon yellow, which makes a cream color, if mixed light, use orange or salmon or brown in 
the shadows or folds. If the dress is pink, which is made with rose color, pale blue will 
make the shadows pretty. Green shades well with brown. When dresses are dark in the 
picture, then the dark colors can be used with impunity ; the bright reds, scarlet, cardinal, 
dark green, magenta, &c., can be applied, and beautiful results obtained. Dresses generally 
appear better in two or three colors. 

Lace and white trimmings should be painted with opaque white by following the lines of 
the same. For this purpose, Chinese white is the best to use. Lace paints well in weak 
yellow tints. 

Very good ideas of the correct way of using colors can be got from the colored fashion 
plates in the ladies' magazines. 

Furs color best in brown, with a little black or blue over it in the shadows. Slippers or 
shoes that are taken light look well in light yellow, blue or rose. 

Stone Walls, Furniture, Trees, Fences, Panels, and all wood work or stone work 
color best with brown. You can shade it with orange, cardinal or blue, and color the high 
lights over with yellow or green. The slate-black is excellent for rock-work. 

BackfiTPOUndS* For light backgrounds use a weak blue at first and strengthen to suit 
ths^ fancy. 

Where there are clonds in backgrounds use blue for the dark clouds and intermingled 
rose and orange or yellow in light places, especially where horizons are represented. A streak 
of yellow and then a streak of blue blended carefully together, or rose color and yellow, produce 
nice effects. Use the colors for this purpose in delicate tints. Where there is ground use 
brown, and light up all the light spots with yellow or orange, deepening the darker shades 
with blue. For grass use green and yellow mixed. Green for carpets and shrubberies. 

The Diamond Paints, Gold, Silver, Copper and Bronze, can often be used to good ad- 
vantage in connection with these colors. Only lo cents a package. 

Always rinse the brush in clean water before using it for a different color. Use fine camel's 
hair artist's brushes. 

To finish photographs nicely, they should be burnished after they are colored. Any photo- 
papber can do iU and ^s^ally will yithopt chfurge,

Water Color Painting with Diamond Art Colors. 

. Under this head comes painting upon paper, cardboard, holly-wood, etc. The easiest of 
all IS coloring outline sketches in flat color. This consists of simply giving a single wash of - 
he desired color, without regard to shading. To prepare the colors for use. put a hflf teaspoon- 
ful of water into a small dish (like a butter plate), and add a drop of the dissolved color de^red. 
by dipping the brush or a stick into the color. If not dark enough, add a drop at a time until 
the desired shade is obtained. Use a separate dish for each color, or else wa«h the dish before 
putting another color into it. Use camel's hair brushes of different sizes, and after dipping 
into he color, press the brush against the side of the dish to remove as much surplus color ^ 
possible. Pass th >rush over the part to be colored, using care not to go outside of the 
outline. If not dark enough, when dry go over it again, adding another drop of dye to the 
water. For making or blending colors see directions for photographs.
