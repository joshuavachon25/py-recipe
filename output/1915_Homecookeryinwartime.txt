HOME COOKERY 
IN WAR-TIME

INTRODUCTION 

A CHARMING lady, who is also a good cook and a clear 
writer, had promised to write for the publisher of this 
volume a little manual of Home Cookery in War- 
time. The Red Cross called her away before the first 
page was written ; and I am bidden to step into the 
breach. For a man who is one year too old to join 
anything more important than a Home Defence corps, 
it is some consolation to try and serve his countrymen 
in another way. Cuisine c'esi mtdecine, said Michelet; 
and good cookery is a cure for the mind's as well as 
the body's ills, besides being cheaper in the end. 



I must explain at the outset the class of readers 
which will be addressed throughout the following 
chapters. It is silly to go angling in waters where no 
fish has ever been known to bite ; and I shall there- 
fore exclude from consideration the cooks in luxurious 
households. Speaking broadly, the servants in great 
houses are the last to respond when an appeal for thrift 
and frugality is made. Even during sieges and 
famines, waste goes on in rich kitchens. I admit 
gladly that there are magnificent exceptions ; but the 
sad truth remains that the servants of the wealthy 
are generally selfish parasites and that it would be a 
waste of breath to preach economy to them so long as 
opportunities for extravagance exist. Happily, many 

5 



6 INTRODUCTION 

heads of families are turning off the pampered and 
strapping footmen who ought to be bearing arms, and 
are attempting to reform their establishments on lines 
which will give employment where it is most needed. 
But thousands of wasteful cooks will go on in the old 
way; and I shall not lose time on suggestions for 
economy in the sphere which they inhabit. 

With reluctance and regret, I must pass by the 
humblest households also. There could be no more 
useful or patriotic work than to knead better ideals 
and sounder practices of cookery into the hearts and 
minds of the working classes. Up to the present, 
however, the task has been hardly begun. We know 
that well-meaning philanthropists and social doctrin- 
aires have laboured long and unselfishly to this end, 
but their industry and zeal have made little impres- 
sion. It is not enough to ascertain the quantities 
and proportions of proteids, and carbohydrates and 
fats and salts required every day by a laundress, or 
a navvy, or a stoker, or a nursing mother, and to pre- 
scribe the cheapest dietary in which these quantities 
and proportions would be found. The wealthier 
classes do not conduct their cooking and their eating 
on such principles ; and their humbler brothers and 
sisters are still more stoutly resolved not to do so. 
We shall not raise the standard of cookery among the 
poor until we have informed ourselves more correctly 
about the poor man's palate and about the attitude 
of the poor man's wife to processes which require 
more elbow-room and more detachment of purpose 
than nine out of ten poor women actually command. 
Let nobody imagine that I am writing without sym- 
pathy for those who toil hard with their hands. But 



INTRODUCTION 7 

it is necessary to be practical and to recognise the 
futility of addressing men and women who will not 
read this book and would regard it almost as a docu- 
ment in a foreign language if it were forced upon them. 
I shall assume my audience to consist of those who 
are cursed neither by poverty nor by riches. So far 
as Home Cookery is concerned, the most receptive 
men and women are such as cultivate a wide variety 
of experiences on the strength of moderate incomes. 
I am thinking of the scores of thousands who are the 
salt of England ; the people who, without forgetting 
to help the poor and to provide for the future, seem to 
get the most out of life ; who bring a wholesome 
curiosity into play, and are always picking up lore 
worth having ; who spend their bits of money in- 
telligently on every occasion, whether it be the choice 
of a book or the planning of a holiday or anything 
else through which the old grooves have been worn too 
well. In writing this book, I have kept in mind the 
ladies of slender means who maintain a certain dignity 
of housekeeping on resources which would barely pay 
for a stockbroker's cigars. I am thinking of the 
generous hostesses who keep open house so pleasantly 
for the benefit of all sorts of unhomely visitors, al- 
though their own means are small. I am thinking 
too of mothers who, with many mouths to feed, are 
none the less determined to keep the flag flying and 
never to subside into slovenliness in the kitchen or at 
table. Nor do I forget the young wives whose fitful 
resolves towards old-fashioned domestic efficiency 
are so little encouraged under modern conditions. 
Last of all, I remember the many men who more or 
less clearly perceive that cookery is an honourable art, 



8 INTRODUCTION 

with nothing effeminate about it. Although " the 
gentlemen " in mid- Victorian times usually looked 
down upon a man who could cook, many of the deepest 
scholars and strongest men of action in history have 
been keen on cooking. This is mainly a book for 
women ; but men may learn from it how to be less 
helpless. In short, it gives advice to all those who 
take a direct part in the operations of their kitchens. 
Some of my readers may have a dozen servants, and 
others may have no more than a woman or young 
girl who comes in for a few hours to do the rougher 
work. I take it for granted, however, that they are 
all alike in wielding, or wishing to wield, supreme 
power in their own kitchens and larders ; and that 
they are not above the preparing of a dish from start 
to finish. 



Unfriendly critics may plausibly say of this manual 
that it is disorderly ; that it abounds in repetitions ; 
and that some matters are discussed at length while 
others equally important are hardly mentioned. The 
answer is that I have not tried to write anything like 
a systematic and complete cookery-book. Indeed 
I assume throughout that every reader possesses one 
of the regular cookery-books and knows how to use it. 
I have aimed rather at sending housekeepers back to 
their cookery-books with a new zeal for tasks in which 
they may have grown stale. While the following 
pages contain at least a hundred practical recipes, 
they are mainly devoted to stating and illustrating 
the great facts and principles from which all worthy 
recipes have been evolved. The woman or man who 



INTRODUCTION 9 

peruses and applies the advice given between these 
covers is certain to go on stud3dng with the aid of 
other and larger works. As for the omission of many 
dishes which were entitled to be described, I can only 
say that my choice has been guided by experience. 
Some dishes are already so well known in English 
kitchens that there was no need to discuss them ; 
others are natural and obvious variations upon the 
recipes I have given ; and a third large group com- 
prises dishes which rarely give satisfaction, although 
their names sound well and the directions look pro- 
mising on paper. Again, many familiar flats are 
expensive or troublesome out of proportion to their 
merits ; or they are not wholesome ; or they are the 
seductive enemies of a palate in course of education. 
Most of my omissions fall under these heads. As for 
the others, they are to be explained by my careless- 
ness or ignorance. But the design of the book will 
become apparent only to those who will read it 
through, repetitions and all. They can turn back to 
particular recipes as occasions arise. 



If I have said little that is explicit on Invalid 
Cookery, it is partly because I do not presume to 
compete with the writers who have specialised in 
such work. There is, however, another reason. 
Careful observations, made during an illness of my 
own and many illnesses of my friends, convince me 
that the best cookery for invalids is simply — the best 
ordinary cookery. With an intelligent doctor to 
hoist the danger signals, a sick man comes through 
his sickness the more quickly if we are not perpetually 



10 INTRODUCTION 

reminding him, by a special diet, that he is ill. This 
does not apply to certain grave cases : but I fear that 
Invalid Cookery has not always helped the doctor 
and the nurse. When an intelligent cook grasps the 
nature of a patient's malady and remembers that he 
is lying warm, without exercise or hard work, it should 
be easy to back up the medicine by means of a plain 
or scanty but varied and attractive diet.

CHAPTER I 

THE ROOTS OF THE MATTER 

Hardly had the Belgian and German guns at Liege 
begun their awful dialogue before England was loud 
with voices telling the non-combatant how to comport 
himself in war-time. 

The advertising agents instantly primed the shop- 
keepers with the cry : " Live as usual : Spend as 
usual: Pay as usual." We were told that only bad 
citizens would cease to play golf, to follow the fashions, 
to enjoy hoUdays, to eat daintily, to dance, to shop, 
to go to the play. " Live as usual." 

This advice is not wholly bad. It aims at keeping 
money in circulation and men and women in employ- 
ment. But many writers of letters to the papers are 
pressing it too far. They seem to argue that every 
well-established habit of luxury and extravagance is 
a sacrosanct vested interest which must be kept in 
being. If we have been accustomed to eat caviare 
at a guinea a pound we must go on eating it, so that 
the caviare merchant shall not be ruined. If it has 
been our practice to buy half-a-dozen pairs of white 
kid gloves every week, we must pity the poor glover 
and go on buying. And. so on. 

Now the truth is that War is an unusual state of 
life which demands unusual arrangements. Since the 
last days of July, twenty million men have been rushed 
away from the farms and fisheries and mills and 

13 



14 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

forges of Europe to fight. Fifty strokes of a dozen 
pens have changed twenty miUion producers into 
twenty miUion consumers. In other words, Europe is 
not living as usual, and we must adjust ourselves to 
her new life. 

Even if we could be sure that there will be no 
scarcity of food and fuel and raiment, most of us 
would still be unwilling to live our usual comfortable 
lives while scores of thousands of Englishmen are 
faring roughly in the field. More. A time of War 
is a time for bracing up the whole life of a nation. 
The Enghsh had become too self-indulgent. Too 
many of us have been living right up to or beyond 
our incomes. In proportion to our numbers and 
responsibilities, we have had too many purveyors of 
luxuries, too many entertainers, too many actors and 
actresses and funny-men and musicians and novelists 
and painters and paid reformers and professional 
sportsmen. To take a single illustration, we have 
had too many pale young men in " the drapery " and 
not enough strapping fellows in the Army. When 
the War is over, we ought to be tougher, simpler, and 
therefore stronger. 

Those who find these arguments superfine will 
perhaps listen to one more reason against "living 
as usual " — namely, that most of us will lack the 
money. Directly and indirectly, this War will cost 
England hundreds — perhaps thousands — of millions 
of pounds. Incomes will be smaller and taxes bigger ; 
and there will be appeals for the sick and wounded, 
for the \vidow and the orphan, which only hearts of 
flint will resist. 

These are the principal reasons for publishing a 



THE ROOTS OF THE MATTER 15 

short manual of Home Cookery in War-time, such 
as may put us on sounder terms with both our con- 
sciences and our purses. 



It is taken for granted throughout the following 
pages that the reader knows the A B C of cookery 
already, and that nobody is to expect much more than 
a number of sound hints on the departures from 
ordinary kitchen routine which the War may demand. 
Let nobody therefore open this book in order to learn 
how to peel a potato or trim a chop or choose a sir- 
loin of beef. I assume from the outset that I am 
speaking to housewives who already possess an ele- 
mentary all-round cookery-book, even if it be no 
bigger than the shilling edition of Mrs Beeton's justly 
admired work. The first principles of boiling and 
frying and baking and braising and steaming will be 
discussed only in so far as I believe that they are 
misunderstood in England. 



Although we may learn much from France, this is 
an English book for English homes. France is, with- 
out doubt, the seat of the finest cookery in the world, 
and this praise applies not only to the haute cuisine 
but also to the wonderful cuisine hourgeoise. All the 
same, we must keep our heads. Englishwomen often 
return from holidays in France (where they have been 
whetting tr^ir appetites in the sea air and were in a 
mood to be ^ased with everything), and straightway 
set about Fi ^ chifying both their kitchens and their 
tables. They /ush to buy books which purport to 



i6 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

expound French cookery to the Enghsh housewife ; 
and, in forty-nine cases out of fifty, they end by 
throwing up the experiment after making themselves 
and everybody else miserable. To take one example 
only, thousands of happy homes have been tempor- 
arily blighted by the tyranny of the stock-pot. Young 
wives find it writ large in the books that no kitchen 
is complete without a stock-pot, and that it is next 
door to downright sin not to keep one in constant use. 
Now a stock-pot is all that was ever claimed for it, 
provided the cook is to the manner born and that it is 
used in what may be called stock-pot conditions. In 
a country house, or farm, where rude plenty is the 
order of the day, a stock-pot is all to the good. It 
costs nothing for fuel, because the big kitchen fire 
is always burning. Every day there are many mouths 
to feed and a large quantity of stock is an unmixed 
blessing. But the case is altogether different when 
one turns to the small kitchen of a modern English 
house or London flat, where the gas stove has estab- 
lished itself so firmly that the kitchen range remains 
unkindled for six months out of twelve. In such 
kitchens the stock-pot takes up precious room and 
adds to the gas bill an amount out of all proportion to 
the value of the stock. Further, the mistress of a 
small establishment soon finds that she has not 
nearly so many odds and ends to throw into the stock- 
pot as she expected. In these days the butcher trims 
the meat more thoroughly than of yore and his ex- 
ample is followed, more or less, by all the other 
purveyors of eatables. Our grandmothers conducted 
their housekeeping in vastly different conditions. 
The huge joints for their large families, the poultry 



THE ROOTS OF THE MATTER 17 

and game which were skinned or plucked and cleaned 
in their own kitchens, and their wealth of raw and 
rough materials of every kind yielded them a constant 
supply of good by-products which were too often 
wasted although such scraps would have rejoiced 
a Frenchwoman's heart. Nowadays the poulterer 
cleans and trusses our birds, too often taking away 
the parts that would yield many a delicacy, such 
as a Cock-a-leekie a la Franfuise (Leek Soup with 
giblets) or a Risotto au foie de volatile. The poul- 
terer fillets our fish, the greengrocer often delivers 
only the choicest hearts of cabbage or cauliflower or 
lettuce, while the grocer sells us most of his goods in 
bottles and jars and tins and packets which contain 
nothing over and above what can be directly con- 
sumed. So let the superstition of the stock-pot 
as a universal obligation go ; and with it let us 
bury most of the nonsense about two penny- 
worth of bones. Soup for twopence has a plausible 
sound ; but when one reckons the cost of the gas and 
the flavourings, it will generally be found that a small 
quantity of one of the admirable new vegetable 
extracts (put up like Liebig's) costs no more money 
and gives a better result for less trouble. The dis- 
coverer of bone-soup a hundred years ago was patted 
on the head by kings and even by a Pope, but 
bare bones as now chopped up and simmered are a 
delusion and a snare. I have made grand stock from 
a ham-bone, correcting its saltiness by omitting all 
salt from the vegetables afterwards added : but that 
ham-bone had something on it and in it. 

Instead of worrying with an unwieldy stock-pot, 
the good housewife will use the beaux restes of her 

B 



i8 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

game and poultry for special soups and for entrees of 
distinction instead of sacrificing them to augment a 
gallon of characterless stock. Without running a 
stock-pot three hundred and sixty-five days a year, 
stock can be made frequently from clean odds and 
ends, or from cheap meat, and used right up. When 
all else fails, foundations can be made cheaply and 
cleanly from beans. Butter beans and their like 
yield light-coloured stock, while flageolets and their 
brethren will give stock of darker hue. These bean 
stocks can be bottled and kept for some time, pro- 
vided they are occasionally poured out and heated 
up. 

Some people will feel that the foregoing paragraphs 
promise poorly so far as economy is concerned. Like 
rustics who believe that medicine must taste nasty 
if it is to do you good, they are persuaded that we 
must put up with unattractive food if we are to save 
money in war-time. This is a deadly error — deadly 
because it soon drives back those who hold it into 
their old extravagance. Men and women who have 
been accustomed to eat pleasantly and daintily will 
not succeed in making an abrupt change to coarse 
and unpleasant diet without injury to their health and 
tempers which will be found expensive in the long run. 
Everybody has heard of things that are " Cheap 
and Nasty " ; but the cook's motto in war-time will 
be Cheap and Tasty. 

Cheapness and tastiness, however, are not every- 
thing. A dish might cost little, and look appetising, 



THE ROOTS OF THE MATTER 19 

and taste good, while at the same time it might be 
indigestible or without value as nourishment. We 
must have Foods that feed. But these pages will not 
be extended by means of long lists of foods arranged 
under elaborate headings in scientific terms. The 
few housekeepers who concern themselves with 
academic dietetics have not waited for the appearance 
of this little book in order to learn about proteids 
and starch and nitrogen and carbohydrates : and 
they know the chief points of " Food Values " already. 
As for the majority, they would either skip such 
information or read it and forget it a minute after- 
wards. But there is a more practical reason for 
omitting scientific tables. It sounds old-fashioned 
to say it, but in matters of diet we still get on best 
without too much theory. A day will dawn when 
the analyst will be able to tell us so much about our 
food that the art of medicine will be almost absorbed 
in dietetics ; but that day has not dawned yet. 
People who live according to food tables certainly 
do not always convince us that they have found the 
golden secret of health and happiness. In the 
present state of chemistry, all the food tables ever 
printed are worth less than the old saw, " One man's 
meat is another man's poison." To certain constitu- 
tions certain foods are almost venomous. The 
writer knows a woman who can eat practically every- 
thing save honey ; and a man who has the digestion 
of an ostrich for all other foods, but is upset by capers. 
To many people, some allowance of cereals and milk 
and sugar seems of vital importance, while others 
hate all such things and keep alive on lean red meat, 
fresh green vegetables and sharp wine. Through 



20 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

not recognising these wide variations of constitution, 
most of the authors who have given us instruction 
in cheap cookery have done as much harm as good. 
They prescribe messes of pottage in which spHt peas 
and lentils and all kinds of pulse predominate to such 
an extent that there is positive danger to those whose 
bodies are not built for such diet. 

It follows that the Compleat Cook must under- 
stand not only the food but the feeders. This will help 
her to steer clear of many a disappointment. Now 
and then it will call for the taking of additional pains, 
because it may be necessary to provide two small 
dishes instead of one large. On the other hand, it 
will often help towards economy, because beaux restes 
are often enough for one but not enough for two. 
Many a housewife, in the intimacy of a small home, 
wiU urge her son or husband to finish some small 
remnant on the ground that it is not worth keeping 
and that it would " only have to be thrown away." 
The son or husband has probably already eaten 
quite as much as is good for him — otherwise he 
would have asked for what is left on the dish — 
but he accepts the morsel and overfeeds himself. 
Once let a housewife accept the notion of occa- 
sionally making up a tiny entree, enough for one 
person only, and she will often find the problem of 
an informal home dinner half solved. The Brute 
wiU get something he likes ; while she herself, for a 
change, will be able to enjoy a little dish all her very 
own, according to her mood and appetite. Where 
the staff is small (and this book is written first and 
foremost for modest establishments) wives are usually 
averse from any multiphcation of entrees on the 



THE ROOTS OF THE MATTER 21 

ground that they make so much washing-up. This, 
however, is a hardship that must be faced. It will be 
faced the more easily when one examines it fairly. A 
choice of entrees does not increase the washing-up 
so frightfully, after all. In any case, the cook who 
is willing to lose the charm of variety and the satis- 
faction of economy merely to save fifty or sixty 
seconds in the washing-up had better put this book 
down and read no more of it. But let her first 
examine her conscience and ascertain whether her 
horror of washing-up may not be due to her skimping 
the dry-soap and the clean dry towels. 



Food values bring to the mind the whole question 
of Food Fads. The War has stirred up scores of well- 
meaning enthusiasts, who are convinced that the 
Kaiser is really doing us a good turn, because England 
will be led to solve her food problem by vegetarianism, 
or paper-bag cookery, or " unfired diet," or the 
steady munching of nuts. Let us be quite fair. 
There is something useful at the heart of every fad, 
just as there is truth buried inside nearly every error. 
We shall therefore do wisely to profit by the kernel 
of any fad that is thrust upon us, so long as we throw 
the husks away. Vegetarianism, for example, has a 
good deal in it, just as there is a good deal in " Temper- 
ance." The true wisdom is to steer between the Scylla 
of excess and the Charybdis of total abstinence. 
By combining the more liberal use of vegetables with 
some of the flavourings and strengthenings of ordinary 
cookery (such as good gravy or meat broth) we could 
often save money and increase our enjoyment. As 



22 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

for " natural " and " unfired " food, it is true that un- 
cooked food, such as apples and pears and salads, can 
do nothing but good to those who use them wisely. 
The paper bag, which was known to cooks long before 
the oldest EngHshman now living was born, is excellent 
for some dishes, always provided that the right kind 
of paper is chosen and that it is used in the right way ; 
but the cook who tries to use paper bags for every- 
thing has become a faddist to be pitied and avoided. 
As for nuts, they certainly have a high food value, and 
all the best-known monkeys do exceedingly well on 
them so long as they can get insects and reptiles also ; 
but only a minority of human beings, bred and born as 
we are, can exist upon them as a staple food. If 
nuts should abound in our copses this year, we ought 
to thank Providence and see that none are wasted; 
but there must be something besides a sack of nuts in 
the pantry. Other fads, especially the proprietary 
and much-advertised fad foods which claim to have 
been predigested, and to contain the nourishing 
elements of eggs or milk or meat or wheat in a highly 
concentrated form, are not to be received with our 
arms too widely open. The human body has been 
fitted, through long ages, to receive new life from 
foods which are not concentrated at all. Their body- 
building and heat-making and blood-enriching and 
bone-forming and nerve-strengthening elements are 
dispersed in vehicles (or " inert " substances) which 
call for mastication and for consumption in such 
bulk that, without being a glutton, one escapes the 
sensation of an empty stomach. It may be quite 
true that a spoonful of this or that or the other patent 
preparation is equal in food value, from the analyst's 



THE ROOTS OF THE MATTER 23 

point of view, to a nice little lamb cutlet with green 
peas and a couple of new potatoes. It may also be 
true that the spoonful of essence can be swallowed 
in ten seconds, while the lamb cutlet requires ten 
minutes. Nevertheless the essence, with its too 
swift and local onslaught upon the system, will be 
found to do the consumer worlds less good. " A 
Lunch in a Tea-spoon " and a " Two-minute Dinner " 
are the ideals of many serious persons who tell us that 
we should eat to live and not live to eat. No man, 
however, is living aright if he becomes a miserable 
creature. To sit decently over a snowy cloth and to 
treat respectfully the good gifts of God as they come 
before us in all their variety cannot fairly be called 
" Living to Eat." Indeed such a meal, enlivened 
by talk, is a refining and spiritualising of the act of 
feeding and is all on the side of progress. [The con- 
centrated fad-foods are often useful in emergencies, 
and a really clever and original cook can turn them to 
all sorts of uses. For the most part, however, they 
are dear, because the purchaser must pay not only 
for the contents of the packet but for a proportion of 
the enormous sums which have been spent in adver- 
tising the brand.] 



To those who have decided by this time that I am 
a reactionary empiric, I give the advice that they 
should hurry back to the shop of the unprincipled 
bookseller who sold them this deplorable work and 
that (after tendering the shilling or so of difference 
in price) they should insist on his exchanging it for the 
popular edition of Sir Henry Thompson's " Food 



24 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

and Feeding." Sir Henry Thompson's is a good 
book. I do not say that a novice would arise from 
its perusal a Compleat Cook, as Minerva sprang full- 
armed from the brain of Jove. But " Food and 
Feeding " is sane and learned and human. Its 
analyses of food values are both scientific and practical. 



I must here warn beginners against certain 
statements as to food values in the propaganda of 
Food Reformers. Only this morning I encountered 
some perilous advice about Brazil nuts, "the kernels 
of which contain over ninety per cent." of outright 
nutriment. A little knowledge is dangerous indeed 
to those who do not know how to apply it. I often 
meet a young man, with a fine scorn for " flesh- 
eaters," who is overfeeding himself so grossly on 
nuts and sugary dried fruits that he would be more 
temperate if he ate a pound of beef every day. 

Too much dietetic doctrine rivets his chains more 
firmly than ever on the hypochondriac. I remember 
obtaining leave one day from an indulgent hostess 
in a house on the south coast to make some horse- 
radish cream my own way. Now all persons who 
have rubbed a large fresh-pulled horse-radish on a 
small and worn-out nutmeg grater know the price 
that must be paid in smarting eyes and scalding tears : 
and they will not blame me for having felt annoyed 
when a dear old gentleman, of conservative tempera- 
ment, at the luncheon-table, refused my cream on the 
ground that he didn't see any reason for changing the 
old recipe. Perceiving, however, that he was a h3^o- 
chondriac, I let drop the remark that horse-radish 



THE ROOTS OF THE MATTER 25 

was good for the heart. He continued to eat his 
roast beef plain : but it is literally true that, late in 
the day, I stumbled on the same dear old gentleman, 
in a grandfather's chair, eating the remains of my 
cream with a spoon. 



In the houses where this kind of book is bought and 
read, men and women are over-nourished rather than 
underfed. This means that meals of high " food 
value" may do more harm than good. Grown-up 
persons do not need much feeding. Indeed the 
first and best hint for saving money on our food in 
war-time is as plain as a haystack : because it is 
merely : Let us eat less. Watch some men, especially 
city men, at their midday lunch, and you will see 
that each mouthful is too large and that it is swallowed 
too quickly. Without running into the other extreme, 
and mincing like Victorian schoolgirls, we ought to 
eat and drink temperately, deliberately ; for in no 
other way can we fully enjoy our food and benefit 
by it. 



Smaller quantities and cheaper qualities of food 
will not mean a blunting "of the reasonable pleasure of 
the table, so long as we have variety. One reason 
why so many Englishmen insist on having always 
the prime joints of meat and the dearest cuts of bacon 
is to be found in the monotony of their diet. When 
there is no charm of surprise to whet the appetite, 
the palate finds its satisfaction in superfine and there- 
fore expensive quality. That cat meant well which 



26 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

brought Sir Walter Raleigh a pigeon every day while 
he was writing his unreadable " History of the World " 
in the Tower of London, but I do not doubt that the 
prisoner became dreadfully peevish on the days when 
the pigeons were not plump and tender. 

I count among my friends an interesting couple who 
firmly believe that they are enthusiasts for cookery. 
Their culinary library certainly contains seven 
thousand recipes : but they do not eat seventy 
different dishes in a year. 

Variety is charming : and, controlled by common- 
sense, it is cheap. 



A wit once wrote a parody on a cookery-book and 
began one of his recipes with the words, " Take about 
eight ounces of anything you have got." He wrote 
more wisely than he knew. If I were asked to state 
in a single sentence the fundamental rule for Home 
Cookery in War-time I should say : '* Plan your 
dishes with what you have." In the chapter on 
" Going to Market " I shall try to bring out this 
truth from another point of view ; but it is so 
important that it had better begin to be hammered 
into the reader here and now. Cook with what 
you have, or with what you can most easily 
obtain. 

Perhaps I shall be allowed to illustrate this point 
by a simple personal experience. One Sunday after- 
noon I found myself alone in a tiny house just outside 
London. The " cook-general " had been called 
away immediately after serving a conventional 
British Sunday midday meal consisting of roast beef, 



THE ROOTS OF THE MATTER 27 

boiled potatoes and white cabbage. The house was 
one where I knew that I could do just as I pleased 
without offending my hostess and her family, who 
had stated that they would return about half-past 
eight for a homely supper of cold beef and pickled 
walnuts and red wine. It was January, and a sharp 
frost prevailed. Cold beef and pickles had a shivery 
sound. Could nothing be improvised that would 
give a warmer welcome ? I looked round the pantry 
and found little beyond a fine Spanish onion, a couple 
of turnips and the remains of the midday meal. On 
a shelf, however, there stood a little white pot of the 
vegetable extract called " Marmite," which tastes 
like Liebig or Bovril, though meat has nothing to do 
with it. I sliced the Spanish onion into the thinnest 
possible slices and put them in a large enamelled stew- 
pan on the gas stove, with enough boiling water for 
them to move in freely, and set them to boil. Having 
prepared the turnips, I cut these also into quite small 
pieces so that they should cook more quickly. Mean- 
while I foraged in other cupboards and found some 
tomato catsup, some Worcestershire sauce, some 
tapioca and about a tablespoonful of Burgundy at 
the bottom of a decanter. As soon as the pieces of 
onion and turnip showed that they were half cooked, 
1 put a teaspoonful of the Marmite at the bottom of 
a basin and poured on the water from the stewpan. 
After this had been well stirred, the basin contained 
a quite respectable broth which I seasoned and poured 
back over the turnips and onion. While the cooking 
of these vegetables in the broth continued, I cut up the 
cold white cabbage, of which there was quite a con- 
siderable quantity, as too much had been boiled in 



28 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

the first instance. The strips of cabbage were trans- 
ferred to the stewpan, together with some of the 
gravy of the beef and a meagre handful of tapioca. 
By this time it was possible to turn down the gas 
under the briskly boiling stewpan and to add a tea- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce and about six times 
the quantity of the tomato catsup. The cold potatoes 
were broken up with a fork and stirred in with the 
other things. These operations were taken in hand at 
about five o'clock, and they occupied less than half-an- 
hour. The pan, with the lid on, remained over the 
smallest possible flame for about three hours. If my 
friends had returned an hour late, no harm would 
have been done. Of course I interrupted my reading 
and writing occasionally to stir the stuff with a 
wooden spoon and to taste it from time to time. 
The tastings proved the need for a little more salt and 
pepper. About eight o'clock I added the glass of 
wine ; but, long before this time, the frosty air was 
warmed and cheered by the most savoury and com- 
fortable of odours. Soup-plates were laid to warm in 
a bowl of hot water, while I cut some slices of bread 
and butter in the country fashion, not too thin, and 
each piece the whole breadth of the "household loaf." 
This rather close-grained bread, when it is a day old, 
carries a surface of butter delightfully as compared 
with the square loaves baked in tins. 

My mess of pottage — it was certainly a mess — ^had 
been intended merely as a piping-hot prelude to the 
cold beef ; but everybody came up for a second 
helping and the beef went away untouched. The 
contents of the stewpan seemed to be inexhaustible. 
Of course the bottle of Macon made a difference, as 



THE ROOTS OF THE MATTER 29 

the pottage was not fluid like a soup. One ate it with 
a fork and a spoon. 

This is a rather long account of a very rough-and- 
ready experiment, but it will serve to bring out the 
principal doctrine of these pages. Among those who 
devoured the dish so heartily sat a woman who hates 
onions, and a man who loathes tapioca, and a child 
with a horror of Worcestershire sauce ; yet not one 
of these persons discerned their abominations. The 
onion had boiled down into a perfect unity with the 
broth, and the tapioca survived only as a slight 
thickening, suggestive of the kind of stock which cools 
into a good jelly. The cabbage maintained its 
texture, as had been intended. But let it be most 
clearly understood that the whole thing was carried 
through as a homely rustic supper, as far from res- 
taurant ideals as the South Pole is from the Equator. 
When the lady who hated onions asked me for the 
recipe, I was careful to explain that recipes belonged 
to entirely different undertakings. A recipe expresses 
the best possible way of cooking a certain dish, and it 
presupposes that the cook will obtain all the specified 
ingredients in their given proportions. My modest 
pottage was arrived at by an exact reversal of recipe 
methods. In carrying out a recipe, one says : "I 
want to make a certain soup : I must get together 
the necessary things." On that nipping Sunday 
night, however, I said : " Here are certain things : 
what can be best done with them for some hungry 
people returning from a cold journey ? " If there 
had been carrots in the house instead of turnips, or if 
the remains of the cabbage had been scanty, or if the 
cold sirloin had been more undercooked, no doubt I 



30 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

should have prepared something entirely different. 
Any merit that there was, lay in the adjustment of 
means to ends. And if the housekeepers of England 
will accept this principle and apply it they will have 
acquired half the art of Home Cookery in War-time. 



CHAPTER II 

THE KITCHEN AND THE LARDER 

When a battleship clears for action, all sorts of things 
are pitched overboard. Down into the green depths 
go the piano and all the landlubbers' tables and 
chairs. And, if we are to take up the simplifying of 
our daily lives in real earnest and with a determination 
not to drift back into our old ways, we shall do well to 
go through our larders and our kitchens and to put 
them, so to speak, on a War footing. For example, 
almost every pantry contains tinned and bottled and 
jarred provisions, and oddments of dripping and 
condiments, which have been on the shelves quite 
long enough. Let these be brought out into the day- 
light and examined. On the principle laid down 
at the end of the foregoing chapter, it should be 
found possible to get rid of some of them by working 
them up into unconventional combinations which will 
have the charm of novelty and perhaps even the 
excitement of discovery. But of course no prudent 
storekeeper will use her tinned fruits and tinned 
vegetables and tinned fishes while the fresh article is 
cheap and abundant. Only an hour or two before 
writing this paragraph I have had the deplorable 
experience of eating some tinned French beans in a 
house where the new crop of the same vegetable can 
be bought for twopence-halfpenny a pound ; and I 
learn that preserved pears were served yesterday at a 

31 



32 HOME /COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

luncheon given by some high-minded ladies to discuss 
this very question of cheap food in time of War. 

In overhauHng the shelves it will probably be found 
that there has been waste in buying. When servants 
are allowed to go shopping, or to give orders at the door 
to the tradesman's assistant, or to draw up lists of 
requirements, they almost always buy extravagantly. 
Sometimes out of a mere desire to be important, 
sometimes from a much lower motive, they ask for the 
largest bottles of vinegar and of oil, the biggest tins 
of mustard, and enough pepper to make a whole 
parish sneeze. Before these things are half consumed 
the vinegar develops ropy dregs, the oil turns bad, 
and the pepper becomes all meek and mild. Now is 
the time to make rough estimates of the weekly con- 
sumption and to see that money is saved in such a way 
as to heighten rather than lower the quality of one's 
stores. 

Forgotten jars will come to light. It may be that 
the price of fruit will be so low that it will still pay to 
make large quantities of jam, in spite of the higher 
price of sugar, and every jar or wide-mouthed bottle 
may come in useful. Indeed sugar is not indispens- 
able. Bottled fruits are exceedingly cheap to prepare 
and are more useful than jam, except where there are 
children and people with a sweet tooth. Those who 
do not possess the proper equipment for fruit -bottling 
may simply place the fruit in bottles (taking care 
that they are perfectly dry) and then put the full 
bottles for a quarter of an hour in a hot oven, finally 
filhng them up with boiling water. And this is the 
place for a useful hint. A stopper of mutton fat will 
solve the almost hopeless problem of finding bungs or 



THE KITCHEN AND THE LARDER 33 

metal tops to fit the jars and bottles. Mutton fat is 
very cheap indeed, and the butcher is glad to sell it. 
Pickles should not be forgotten. When they are 
home-made according to the very simple directions 
in the regular cookery books, they are nearly always 
relished, and they send down many a piece of cold 
meat which would otherwise be a penance. Nas- 
turtium seeds are excellent when pickled, and they 
put a wonderful amount of life into all sorts of dishes, 
although few cooks serve them except with mayon- 
naise, or boiled cod, or mutton. 



In the kitchen and the scullery a similar stock- 
taking should be made, and utensils which have been 
long disused should be either furbished up and brought 
into action, or packed away in a box to be given to the 
most suitable Relief Committee, or to poor persons 
who have a genuine use for them. At the same time 
perhaps it will be necessary to spend a few shillings 
on earthenware cooking-pots. This is not a time for 
laying out money lightly, but the cost of a few cas- 
seroles, large, small and medium, will soon be recouped. 
Indeed such vessels are absolutely necessary to the 
successful practice of cheap and nourishing and 
appetising cookery. What we call roast joints (by 
which most people mean joints baked in an oven) are 
not cheap as a rule, and they are often unattractive 
after the first day. Besides, quite apart from the 
question of economy, meat is far better when it is 
cooked slowly at a more moderate temperature. 
For those who live in or near London the best and 
cheapest region in which to buy a casserole is Soho, 
c 



34 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

where the right article is in constant demand by 
French menag^res and restaurateurs. The shop- 
keeper who sells it is generally willing to tell the 
English novice all sorts of curious things about the 
wrong and right use of a casserole. For example, he 
will probably advise that it should be rubbed all over 
with half of a raw onion before its first exposure to 
the fire, as he believes that it will last much longer 
after such treatment. 

Any enamelled saucepan which has failed to keep 
a whole skin must be sentenced to death. It is not 
to be given to the charwoman or even thrown into 
the dustbin. If a saucepan with a bald patch in the 
lining is dangerous to you and your family, it will be 
equally dangerous to the charwoman's son Clarence 
or to the dustman's little daughter Eva. If you are 
dead against waste, you can save the saucepan for a 
day when you wish to relieve a fit of bad temper and 
you can then bash it out of shape with your largest 
hammer. In short, you may do anything you like 
with it except allow it to be used for cooking. One 
day last week I took a lot of trouble telling some 
friends how to prepare a new Friday soup, with milk, 
cocoanut butter, fish stock, a minced onion, a packet 
of dried fish in flakes, and some small pieces of 
macaroni. In working out this novelty I had been 
attentive to details and it was hard to see how my 
friends could go wrong. They chose, however, to 
effect the cooking in a large enamelled stewpan from 
which the enamel had disappeared in the most vital 
spot. Of course the pieces of macaroni stuck to the 
bare metal and the whole mixture was ruined, although 
I had succeeded beyond my hopes a day or two 



THE KITCHEN AND THE LARDER 35 

before by using exactly similar materials in a sound 
vessel. [Some of the worst of the cheap enamelled 
goods came from Germany, and it is to be hoped that 
we shall not try to capture this branch of Germany's 
trade.] There is one kind of saucepan which I 
cannot help recommending by name. If bears the 
well-known " Gourmet " mark and most ironmongers 
seem to be able to get it. The lid (as well as the sides 
and the bottom) is enamelled internally and there is 
an extra bottom with a fireproof lining so that the 
contents of the pan cannot burn. I am not referring 
to an ordinary double-cooker, in which the food- 
receptacle fits into a lower pan of boiling water. 
There ought, however, to be a double-cooker in 
every good kitchen, as well as arrangements for 
doing the work of a bain-marie. In short, there 
must be an all-round equipment for the kinds of 
cookery which avoid close contact with fierce 
heat. 

A cheap steamer ought to be in every kitchen, but 
it is sometimes missing even in houses which contain 
all sorts of expensive and foolish little futilities for 
making mayonnaise or cutting up cucumbers. Most 
kinds of fish and vegetables are far better steamed 
than boiled, while a much greater proportion of their 
most valuable elements is retained. I remember 
once being allowed to taste the convicts' dinner at 
Portland. It included some steamed potatoes so 
delicious that (having wrestled with an infamously 
boiled potato at the hotel only an hour or two before) 
I could no longer believe that the way of the trans- 
gressor is hard. 

A frying-pan is a tool to be mentioned with circum- 



36 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

spection. Of late years a saying has been going 
round to the effect that if you want to get rid of 
indigestion your first act must be to throw the frying- 
pan away. To those people who are too lazy or too 
obstinate to learn the true method of frying, such 
advice is excellent, because most of the fried food 
served in England is indigestible in the extreme. 
True frying, however, is quite a different thing from 
the flinging of slices of fresh or cured flesh or cylinders 
of sausage meat to be scorched with a little grease in 
a shallow pan. The sound way is to use a pan deep 
enough to hold a bath of boiling fat in which the food 
to be fried can be completely immersed. Full direc- 
tions on this point will be found in every standard 
cookery book and must be studied by every cook 
who has not mastered them already. As boiling fat is 
nearly twice as hot as boiling water, it is obvious that 
wonders can be worked with its aid ; because a film 
forms instantly on the food placed in the bath and 
all the finest juices and flavours are prevented from 
escaping. A little practice with white blotting-paper 
or a cloth will soon enable any handy and intelligent 
person to rid the finished friture of greasiness, because 
the frying-fat at its hottest is not at all sticky but 
comes away with surprising ease. Cooking oil, which 
need not be the purest pressings from the olives of 
Provence, but should not be of too low a grade, is 
the best frying medium. Of course it can be used 
over and over again, provided one watches for the 
little danger-signal of smoke so that it never over- 
passes the safe maximum of heat. Beef dripping is 
also an excellent frying fat, and it seems easier to 
procure than of old. Indeed the most famous of 



THE KITCHEN AND THE LARDER 37 

Mayfair purveyors has begun to sell the highest 
quality of beef dripping at sixpence a pound. 



Turning from the kitchen to the china closet, it will 
be seemly to put away the thinnest glass and the most 
costly china. During the War we shall hate the idea 
of drinking expensive Champagne and rare vintages 
of Burgundy and Claret and we shall be equally 
impatient of elaborate and ceremonious dinners. So 
let the fine things be hoarded against the day of 
victory. We shall enjoy our less luxurious fare all the 
more if we eat it from plain white or willow-pattern 
plates — preferably the plain white. And let the most 
exquisite of our napery be stored up with the finest 
of our glass and china. When our relatives and 
friends come back from the War, we shall like them 
to know that we have not been clothing ourselves in 
purple and fine linen and faring sumptuously every 
day, but that we have tried to share, afar off, what 
St Paul would have called " the fellowship of their 
sufferings." 



CHAPTER III 

GOING TO MARKET 

No man can make an omelette without breaking eggs, 
or grill a steak when he has no steak to grill, or braise 
a Spanish onion which he does not possess. The 
fame of Mrs Glasse survives solely in the misquotation 
which advises you to " First catch your hare and then 
cook it." In these days we are no longer pot-hunters. 
Having acquired money in a struggle for existence 
fiercer than any cave-dweller's, we go to the men who 
sell birds and beasts and fishes and eggs and butter 
and vegetables and fruits. They also are struggling 
for existence, and, even in Peace-time, it is necessary 
that we should watch them keenly. 

The English are not a thrifty nation. With the 
exception of a small minority, made up for the most 
part of self-made people, everybody lives up to his 
income. Two husbands out of three are convinced 
that their households ought to be run more cheaply ; 
and forty-nine wives out of fifty honestly believe that 
no other woman could perform the marvels of parsi- 
mony which they accomplish every day. This is a 
curious state of things. Nearly all wives are loyal 
and nearly all of them find it hard to make both ends 
meet ; yet the year's menus in a typical English 
home would suggest that a nice little sum is being 
saved up for a rainy day. The explanation is two- 
fold. Enghsh housekeepers rarely get the most out of 

3S 



GOING TO MARKET 39 

what they buy ; and they rarely buy to the best 
advantage. This chapter is concerned with the 
question of buying. 



I lived six years ago in a house so situated that 
there was a wide choice of routes to London. To reach 
one of the tram-lines I had to pass through a quarter 
inhabited by the upper working class, who favoured 
bay-windowed houses, all alike, with plaster horses 
in the semicircular windows over the front doors and 
with tinny pianos or raucous harmoniums in the never- 
ventilated parlours. Sometimes I went in the opposite 
direction, to a station, and walked up leafy avenues 
where every house lacked a number and was dubbed 
"Sans Souci," or "The Wigwam," or worse. And 
every morning I saw the same sad sight. Neither 
Mrs Smith of 749 Jubilee Road nor Mrs Smythe of 
" The Rowans," Beechcroft Avenue, seemed to realise 
that she ought to go to market. She expected the 
market to come to her. In Jubilee Road the market 
took the form of a coster's barrow in charge of a 
beery gentleman whose voice was the worse for wear. 
In Beechcroft Avenue the market was represented 
by a pert young man in a ready-made blue suit, who 
always had enough time on his hands to exchange 
gallantries with Mrs Smythe's housemaid. I do not 
doubt that both Mrs Smith and Mrs Smythe truly 
loved their husbands and that they would have given 
their little fingers to avoid the recurring financial 
discussions which soured life at " The Rowans " and 
at No. 749. It simply did not occur to them that a 
market which comes to one's door is no market at all. 



40 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

I have lost sight of both these equally estimable 
ladies, but I do not doubt that they are being hurried 
to their graves by the houndings of monetary worry. 
As this book is written more for " The Rowans '* 
than for Jubilee Road (where literature is not habitu- 
ally encouraged), it will be practical to confine our- 
selves to the errors of Mrs Smythe. Shortly after the 
departure of Mr Smythe to the city, his spouse hears 
the bell ringing and is met by her servant with the 
words : " The butcher, mum." Now what takes 
place in Mrs Smythe's mind ? She tells herself that 
she had ribs of beef on Sunday ; that she ordered veal 
cutlets for Tuesday night ; that a beef steak was 
bought on Wednesday ; that Friday will be a fish 
day ; and that therefore to-day, Thursday, it would 
be nice to have half-a-leg of mutton — the shank end. 
Accordingly she says : " Tell him to send half-a-leg — 
the shank end — of mutton, not too big." Sometimes, 
by good luck, this turns out to be a happy shot. But 
on other occasions it will not do at all. The young 
man in the blue suit passes from " The Rowans " to 
*' The Lindens," and thence to " The Hollies " and 
" The Beeches " and all the other trees of the forest. 
When he returns to the shop, his notebook is an 
awkward document. If divine Providence had only 
been pleased to give mankind a sheep with nine legs 
and only one shoulder, the butcher's task would be 
easy ; but this, after all, would not solve the problem, 
as the next day's orders might require a sheep consist- 
ing entirely of chump chops. The butcher does his 
best ; but, like soldiers and other men of blood and 
steel, butchers are usually men of few words, and 
they have a deep-seated horror of ladies' tongues. 



GOING TO MARKET 41 

It follows that Mrs Smythe, who is a good customer, 
pa5ang promptly and never complaining, may not 
get her shank end after all, but has to put up with the 
upper half of the leg, while the chatelaine of " Kenil- 
worth," who spends thre^-and-ninepence a week and 
is always threatening to go to another butcher, gets 
the pick of the shop. Meanwhile the butcher is 
loaded up with fore-quarters and saddles which no- 
body wants. Further, as he has delivered all the half- 
legs on credit, he has to take the risk of never getting 
his three-and-ninepence from " Kenilworth," which 
means that " The Rowans " must pay perhaps a half- 
penny a pound more. Also, somebody must pay for 
the young man's blue suit and for his modest 
expenditure when he takes Mrs Smythe's maid out 
on Sunday afternoons. In short, the whole affair is 
what the learned would call an uneconomic trans- 
action. And when it is extended to the fishmonger, 
the greengrocer, the Italian warehouseman and the 
provision merchant, the wonder is how Mr Smythe 
has kept a roof over Mrs Smythe's head. 

On the way to my station stood a row of shops — 
the very shops from which the blue young man and 
his colleagues went forth every morning. And there 
or thereabouts I often saw an edifying sight. A young 
matron, a neighbour of the lady whom I have called 
Mrs Smythe, though her superior in birth and social 
standing, was to be met every day, like a French- 
woman with her bonne, going to market. She was 
always prettily but sensibly dressed in blue linen 
or old-fashioned print ; always unfiurried ; always 
beaming and healthy. Once or twice I happened to 
be in shops while she was shopping. I noticed that 



42 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

she never took a memorandum from her Httle bag in 
order to buy the materials for a premeditated menu. 
The market came first and the menu afterwards. 
Holding to the great principle that what is cheapest 
and most abundant in the market is generally what is 
best, she seemed to get the pick of everything at about 
two-thirds the prices paid by her stay-at-home 
neighbours for less desirable purchases. Yet there 
was no beating down or chaffering in the French 
manner. Her rosy little servant received the pur- 
chases into a net bag there and then, thus ending all 
risk of underweight and overcharge and changing, not 
to mention the ugly dangers of corrupt manoeuvres 
on the part of the young man in blue. No doubt this 
clever woman had acquired a general sense of menu- 
making which enabled her to resist the seductions of 
mere cheapness, so that she would not, for example, 
have combined salmon, and duck, and strawberries- 
and-cream in one short dinner ; but her obvious rule 
was to base her cuisine upon the market. I invoke 
her gracious image as I write and beseech her to be 
the patron saint of this chapter. 



I am bound to warn my docile readers that when 
they put these counsels into practice they will not 
enjoy their first shopping expeditions. In some 
places it still requires a little courage to go out with 
one's servant and to come back with one's dinner. 
But this War will be a poor affair if it does not blow 
away the remains of snobbery from all decent people. 
The idea that nobody of gentle birth can be seen 
carrying a parcel is not quite dead, but the War 



GOING TO MARKET 43 

should kill it. Thousands of the best of our race are 
carrying heavy knapsacks at this moment under a 
scorching sun, and it will not disgrace their sisters to 
bear home a whiting or even a cauliflower. Some 
of the tradesmen will sniff a little superciliously ; but, 
when one thinks it over, such sniffs are not of the first 
importance. Besides, the sniffs sometimes mean 
that the tradesman discerns the beginnings of a new 
relationship in which he will be obliged to treat his 
customer with more punctilious fairness. 

The housewife with common-sense will soon dis- 
tinguish between tradesmen who are white and trades- 
men who are shady. Among the shops to avoid is the 
shop with two prices for the same article. Some 
tradesmen will sell you, without a word of haggling, 
for elevenpence, a pound of bacon for which they will 
ask another customer tenpence or a shilling, and there 
is the same risk with all goods at fluctuating prices. 
No doubt it is to avoid this danger that thousands of 
people have given up shopping altogether and have 
decided to " Order everything from the stores." 
The best stores give good value and careful service ; 
but, with all respect to them, better and cheaper 
cookery can be achieved by the housekeeper who will 
learn the ways of her local market. Happily, almost 
every part of London is now blessed with a few good 
shops where the prices of perishable foods are pro- 
minently displayed. Many of the fishmongers, for 
example, exhibit blackboards on which they chalk 
the prices of the day, sometimes adding the informa- 
tion that such and such a fish is cheap. The largest 
greengrocers also state their prices plainly. But 
when one turns to the butcher it is rare to see price 



44 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

tickets, except in the low-grade establishments. For 
this omission the butcher has a partial excuse. 
People are a little unreasonable in their ideas of boning 
and trimming a piece of meat at the butcher's expense, 
and they will often, after deciding on a joint, say that 
it is rather more than they want and that they cannot 
take it unless it is reduced in size — an operation which 
may mean a loss. Still, the butcher is a man who 
wants careful watching. 



As soon as you have decided which butcher seems 
likely to suit you best, it is well to treat him openly 
and to trust him so long as he plays the game. It is 
quite a mistake to think that he despises everybody 
who does not buy sirloins of beef, legs of lamb, fillet 
steaks and the other prime cuts. The truth is that 
he is quite glad to sell, at half the price of the prime 
cuts, the brisket and the flank which hardly anybody 
asks for, although these parts can be made delicious 
by processes explained in all cookery books. Necks 
of mutton and stewing beef, which are better for 
many purposes than legs and sirloins, are part of the 
butcher's stock and he wants to sell them. 

When one has become a fairly good and regular 
customer, it is fair to insist that the butcher shall not 
be disobhging with such things as calf's liver, sweet- 
bread, tongues and ox-tails. In some shops the 
request for these things is always met by a smile and 
a shake of the head, sometimes accompanied by 
valuable anatomical information to the effect that 
an ox has only one tail and that everybody cannot 
expect to get it. An ox-tail is a most desirable pur- 



GOING TO MARKET 45 

chase, especially in cold weather, and no housekeeper 
ought to accept constant refusals. As for the sweet- 
bread and the pick of the calf's liver, I remember a 
town where an English resident could hardly get these 
delicacies at the principal butcher's. A French- 
woman, always alluded to with great reverence as 
" Maddum," doggedly insisted on having them for 
her rather extensive entertaining, and, if the butcher 
presumed to disappoint her, he was promptly and 
sharply told that she would not darken his shop door 
again. This was an extreme case ; but selfishness 
almost as great is to be found in every locality, and it 
is one's duty gently to insist that greedy people shall 
not be rewarded for their meanness. 

A good butcher will be rather flattered than other- 
wise if you ask his advice, provided that you do so at a 
slack time of his day. He will pickle or marinate the 
cheaper cuts for you and, when he finds that you are 
not a grumbler and that you want him to have his 
fair profit, he will give you the advantage on stocks 
which he wants to sell. He does not like suspicions 
expressed about the origin of this or the other joint, 
but when he is fairly and openly asked if he can supply 
chilled South American beef (which is often excellent), 
or the admirable New Zealand lamb known as 
" Canterbury," he will answer you honestly. Should 
he sell you any chilled meat, it will be as well to con- 
sult him about thawing it, as sad things have happened 
through a neglect of this precaution. I write this 
page a day or two after meeting with a case in point. 
A body of Red Cross workers, most of whom hold 
certificates for proficiency in cooking, sat down to 
their own dinner after a laborious day. Their joint — 



46 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

a leg of lamb — came out of the oven smelling ador- 
ably. It was browned and apparently a little over- 
cooked, in the way which nearly every woman loves. 
But, when the carver's knife laid it open, the inside 
had the appearance of raw meat and, when touched 
with the finger, struck almost as cold as meat that 
had not been cooked at all. The certificated cooks 
pounced on all the fr^dng-pans they could find and 
made a dinner of slices fried in the English style. 

Smaller purchases should not be left for the butcher's 
boy to deliver but should be taken straight home. 
Larger cuts ought always to be weighed as soon as 
they arrive : because the weight sometimes fails to 
agree with what was charged for. And here and 
there a butcher will be found trying to play the 
meanest of all mean tricks, such as sending home the 
hoof of a full-grown sheep with the leg of a baa-lamb, 
and adding to the bones and fat which you have asked 
him to remove from your joint some bones and fat 
belonging to an entirely different beast. A little 
observation suffices to teach anybody of intelligence 
whether he is being made to carry more than his fair 
burden of fat and bones. 



At the fishmonger's, marketing is easier than at 
the butcher's. In these days of abundant ice all the 
year round, bad fish is a rarity. Among the good 
fish it requires skill and experience to choose out those 
which have been most lately caught. Most house- 
wives are forced, therefore, to depend upon the fish- 
monger's good faith, and happily they may often do so 
without disaster. Should a beginner read these lines, 



GOING TO MARKET 47 

I can only warn her to see that the flesh of her fish is 
not flabby, that the eyes are bright and not sunken, 
and that there is no stale odour. 

On some days cod is very cheap. It is a fish which 
many people find insipid, because it is so often served 
sodden from a pan of boiling water, with plain pota- 
toes and a so-called sauce which would do admirably 
for bill-posting but for little else. Steaks of cod, 
nicely grilled, are delightful. A large piece of steamed 
cod can also be made attractive, and what remains of 
it should be pounded smooth, and flavoured and 
potted for breakfast. 

Herrings are likely to figure among our principal 
blessings while the War lasts. Large quantities of 
them used to be sent to Germany, and we shall have 
the benefit of what the Germans must now do without. 
If herrings were caught in only one bight or sea-lough 
in all the world, gourmets would cheerfully pay a 
crown apiece for them and would give herring 
dinners in the most expensive restaurants. But, 
these fish being absurdly cheap, an idea has got about 
that they are slightly vulgar and one has had to be 
a bold man to include the herring in the menu of a 
formal dinner. At formal dinners, salmon, lobster, 
trout, turbot and soles — especially soles — have had it 
nearly all their own way. Some diners-out come to 
hate the sight of salmon by the third week of the 
season, and would be filled with secret joy if they 
could exchange a portion which has cost the hostess a 
shilling for a small fresh herring which would cost a 
penny or less. Herrings require some surgical skill 
and patience, because of the bones ; but many other 
delicacies, such as quails and walnuts, demand deft 



48 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

handling, and we do not shun them on that account. 
A grilled herring with potatoes is said to be an almost 
perfect food, and when the peasantry of Munster and 
Connaught can add buttermilk to this diet they seem 
to be the happiest and healthiest of men. 

Of recent years the fishmongers have begun to sell 
a fish called rock salmon, which is remarkably cheap 
and very good eating. After pursuing some pains- 
taking studies, I find that the fish appears to be 
called rock-salmon because it is not salmon and has 
nothing to do with rocks. Its true name is " cat- 
fish," and when encountered in the water it cer- 
tainly has a cattish head which is less attractive than 
that of a smoke-blue Persian pussy at a show. It is 
by no means an unclean fish ; indeed its head is 
furnished with an arrangement which enables it to 
crack open oysters and to feed upon them. One 
might almost say that in buying sixpenny-worth of 
rock salmon one is sometimes getting oysters to the 
value of about five shillings thrown in. When no 
third party is Hstening, I generally ask the fishmonger 
for cat-fish by its proper name, but some of the rising 
generation of fishmongers do not know what is meant. 
Rock salmon can be served in many ways, but I find 
it best steamed and served with a rosy sauce.^ 

Whiting, " the chicken of the sea," when fried in a 
deep bath of oil or dripping, make a pleasant change 
at a low price. Skate, which is heartily despised by 
hundreds of thousands of people, will delight the 

^ After writing the above lines, my attention was drawn to a 
cookery book in which rock salmon is identified with hake ; but 
in the London shops it is certainly cat-fish. I bought one weigh- 
ing nearly four pounds for a shilling on 8th September 1914. 



GOING TO MARKET 49 

palates of hundreds of thousands of others when it is 
prepared au beurre noir — that is to say, with butter 
melted and turned dark by means of a few drops of 
vinegar and some capers. And nearly everybody 
will like skate, d VIndienne, which is practically a 
curry, the fish being served amidst some well-boiled 
rice and drowned in curry sauce. 

By going to the fishmonger's instead of letting his 
assistant come bicycling round to your tradesmen's 
entrance for orders, you will often be able to buy the 
finer kinds of fish at low prices. The market is 
occasionally glutted. I could name a restaurant in 
London where a low-principled proprietor was in the 
habit of passing off halibut for turbot in some of the 
made dishes, such as Coquilles de Turbot and Turbot 
Mornay. Through inattention to the market he 
served these impostures two or three days running 
when turbot was selling much more cheaply than 
halibut. And I have known a day when a stay-at- 
home housewife \fas giving cod to her family at a 
price which would have bought (allowing for the more 
concentrated nature of the richer fish) an equal 
ration of salmon. 

Plaice, limandes (generally spoken of as lemon 
soles) and other second-class fish are sometimes dear 
out of proportion to their merits. But mackerel is 
always a good purchase when there is no doubt about 
its freshness. Indeed mackerel is often much more 
enjoyable than salmon when hot, and it is also a 
tasty and satisfying cold luncheon dish when it has 
been " soused." Fresh haddock must not be over- 
looked ; but some of the richly coloured objects 
which are passed off as fillets of haddock are dis- 



50 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

appointing. The genuine smoked fillet stews beauti- 
fully in milk and butter in an earthenware pot ; but 
the wrong article can only be commended to those 
who eat fish as a penance. 

Shellfish are often cheap. Great care needs to be 
taken with mussels, but when you have the right 
specimens and know how to prepare them they are 
hailed with joy by those who like them, especially 
when marinated in the French way, with a sauce like 
a fish soup, which one can eat with a spoon. A few 
mussels are also necessary when one wants to improve 
some steamed fillets of rather tasteless fish by dressing 
them in the mode which all cookery books describe 
under the name of Normande. As for scallops, there 
is nothing much more distinguished than a Coquille 
St Jacques. The scallop shells ought not to be 
thrown away, and the hot scallops should be served 
therein. 

The papers, especially the religious weeklies, usually 
contain brief advertisements in which certain Grimsby 
firms offer to send by Parcel Post small packages of 
fresh fish already prepared for cooking. They some- 
times give the purchaser quite a large quantity for a 
couple of shillings. In the long run, however, most 
people find this no cheaper than buying fish locally. 
Where there are large families and the church's 
precept is closely obeyed on days of abstinence, these 
Grimsby packages may be taken regularly with 
advantage ; but in small households there would 
often be waste unless the cook is clever at potting 
the surplus. 

What has been said about carrying home one's 
smaller purchases from the butcher applies to the 



GOING TO MARKET 51 

fishmonger as well. I have seen fillets of sole which 
could not possibly have been fitted to the skeletons 
of the fish which I had chosen and paid for. Still, 
on the whole, the fishmonger will treat you fairly 
well if you are reasonable with him and are not above 
taking his advice. 



At the poulterer's, a patriotic housewife will deny 
herself the luxury of young chickens until the War is 
over. We ought to let most of the chickens grow 
up to lay eggs for us. Eggs will be dear. By increas- 
ing our home output, we may succeed in permanently 
securing a larger share of the egg trade for our own 
population. As for the bigger chickens, these should 
be kept as much as possible for the sick and wounded. 
Chicken broth and little pieces from the breast are 
tempting to many a convalescent, although their 
food value is slightly overrated. 

By casting a glance every day at the poulterer's 
counter you are sure to pick up great bargains from 
time to time. During the first month of the War I 
have seen rabbits, poultry and grouse at such low 
prices that they have often been cheaper than mutton 
and beef. Probably we must expect a great shrinkage 
in the imports of the frozen and rather tasteless game 
birds from the East ; but, on the other hand, English 
game birds may be cheap, as thousands of brace which 
would have been shot to give away will drift into the 
market. One may express the hope that venison will 
also come into its own again during the War. Pro- 
vided that people will get away from the loathsome 
superstition that venison must be outrageously high 



52 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

before it is fit to eat, tlie national larder can be en- 
riched to a great extent with this meat. A haunch of 
venison with a puree of chestnuts, some diamonds of 
scarlet runners, and a little red-currant jelly will make 
a meal full of old-world charm and often twenty per 
cent, cheaper than an equally ample repast of mutton 
or beef or veal. Indeed the whole question of venison 
cookery, which would require a book as large as 
this for its proper discussion, is well worth going 
into, and every housekeeper should risk a few 
experiments. 

The poulterer, when he plucks and cleans and 
trusses a bird for you, ought not to keep the liver and 
the giblets. Indeed, by watching every point, you 
may find birds almost the most economical food you 
can buy. I bought a brace of black game the other 
day for three shillings and threepence. They served 
six persons on two nights — first as a roast and second 
as a salmis, and I made some soup from them the 
third day. 



Under the ugly name of the greengrocer there is in 
every town and suburb a man who buys and sells the 
most beautiful of all our foodstuffs. Nobody will 
claim that a butcher's is a gallery of pictures or that 
fish out of water provoke gaiety. But a well-stocked 
greengrocer's is a thing of beauty and a joy until 
closing time. Apples as rosy as the cheek of a country 
wench, peaches with a bloom that the most exquisite 
dame must envy, grapes like great beads of amber, 
and oranges and lemons like a windfall of tiny suns 
and moons keep company with scarlet tomatoes. 



GOING TO MARKET 53 

with yellow bananas, with purple beets and with 
every shape and size and hue of leafage and 
rootage. 

It would be an exaggeration to say that green- 
grocers without exception have lived up to the 
splendours of their wares ; nor does it often transpire 
that they are poets and painters in their scanty 
leisure. Until the twentieth century came in, the 
vegetable shop was generally an unlovely place. At 
the top of the scale there were a few vegetable dealers 
whose stocks were well kept and well shown ; but 
one had to pay what might be called florists' prices, 
as if everything had been grown under glass or 
imported in tissue paper and cotton-wool. Things 
have changed for the better. Many greengrocers, 
whose prices are almost as low as the lowest, make a 
point of dressing their fronts with so much richness 
and abundance that one is thrilled as by the sight of 
a huge cornucopia outpoured. The interior of the 
shop cannot be as spotless as a high-class dairy, 
because earth is always being liberated from tubers 
and soiled leaves are constantly being torn from 
greens. Still, a well-managed greengrocer's ought 
to be pleasant both outside and inside. When it is 
found to be slovenly, a housekeeper will usually be 
safe in leaving it alone. She should beware, however, 
of expecting the standard of the fruit and vegetable 
tents at a big flower show. Prize exhibits are beauti- 
ful to look at, but they are often second-rate when 
one tries to eat them. If the greengrocer should 
cleanse away every speck of Mother Earth from his 
turnips and horse-radishes and potatoes, he would 
have to raise his prices, and at the same time he would 



54 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

rob the stuff of a coat which protects it from the many 
contaminations of street air. 

Vegetables need and will repay a lifelong course 
of close observation. Some cooks will calmly ask 
for so many carrots and so many turnips to compound 
a certain stew, as if carrots and turnips are as un- 
alterable as half bricks. Yet there is a world of 
difference between one carrot and another carrot, one 
turnip and another turnip. Some turnips might 
almost have been turned by a lathe out of white 
wood, and some carrots are limp, with a colour more 
yellow than red. And these remarks apply to all 
other vegetables in greater or less degree. It follows 
that the recipes in cookery-books are often no more 
than indications of an ideal, and that they must be 
modified in practice according to the stronger or 
weaker flavours, the more tough or more tender 
fibres of the ingredients. Again, a point is reached 
in the growth of most vegetables when they become 
unpleasant. French beans and scarlet runners are 
sometimes sold in a state which no reasonable amount 
of boiling can correct, and radishes are still marketed 
when all their briskness has given place to a faded 
flabbiness. The less honest or less able greengrocer 
stocks his shop with stuff that his colleagues will not 
touch. 

In some parts of London one comes upon what 
looks like a row of costers' barrows but is really an 
open-air fruit market. If any reader of this book 
should visit Soho to buy a casserole, as already ad- 
vised, it would not be a waste of time to walk along 
Little Pulteney Street, which runs westward from 
Wardour Street. On Fridays and Saturdays especi- 



GOING TO MARKET 55 

ally the fruit and vegetable market is a wonderful 
sight. Those who are willing to put on old clothes, 
and to leave all airs and graces at home, will be 
recompensed for any ungentle little bustlings and 
jostlings. One must be a bit of a linguist, a working 
acquaintance with the Cockney language being almost 
essential. And one must muzzle one's sense of the 
ridiculous. A few months ago I used to buy in this 
street enormous grape-fruits, of a ripeness and flavour 
unknown to me elsewhere. I paid on an average 
three-halfpence each. When cut in half and properly 
prepared, each fruit was enough for two persons. 
Unhappily, however, I tried to do the proprietor of 
the barrow a good turn by pointing out the defects 
in his placard, which read : 



GRAIPE FRUIT 

THE ONLY FRUIT IN THE WORLD 
CONTANING 

150 PER SENT OF QUININE 



Whether the scribe thought that I was going to indict 
him under the Food and Drugs' Act I cannot say, but 
he flew into a hot rage and challenged me to produce 
the man or woman or babe unborn that had ever 
known him acting not straight or fair. I have also 
learnt, as soon as I see grand globe artichokes in Little 
Pulteney Street at tenpence a dozen, to buy them 
without a smile when the proprietor commends them 
as "These 'ere chokes," and to be equally discreet 
when, in the asparagus season, I receive sporting 
offers of " Grass." The barrows are a guide to the 



56 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

waxing and waning of seasons. When a given fruit 
or vegetable has passed its hey-day, it disappears 
entirely. And yet many exotics find their way into 
this unlovely thoroughfare, where I have bought 
beautiful boxes of fresh purple figs and mandarins 
for sixpence the box of two or three dozen. Pine- 
apples are also to be found, though not so abundantly 
as one might expect. When a pine -apple is full-ripe 
and even shows in one spot an over-maturity which 
would spoil it for a West End fruiterer's window, it is 
at its best for immediate eating. I shall explain in 
the proper place a way of serving it. Still, we ought 
to trade with our local greengrocer as a rule, so long 
as he behaves himself. The man with the barrow pays 
no rates or rent. He would fall dead at the mere 
suggestion of paying income tax, although he is often 
rich enough to buy up two or three men who pay it 
regularly. Besides, the local man is at hand for our 
convenience in wet weather or fine, and this ought not 
to be forgotten. 

One of the greatest mistakes of the ordinary house- 
keeper, from the point of view of the gourmet, and one 
of the chief reasons for the expensiveness of her 
housekeeping, is the habit of visiting the greengrocer 
last when marketing. Nearly every English cook 
chooses the meat first and the vegetables afterwards — 
hardly ever the vegetables first and the meat to suit 
it. I think this is one more sound explanation of the 
monotony of English menus, and I recommend an 
occasional reversal of the order. By going now and 
then to the greengrocer first one will start a new train 
of ideas. 

For instance, there are days when small white cab- 



GOING TO MARKET 57 

bages are at their best and cheapest, and the sight of 
them might well suggest cabbages cunningly stuffed, 
one for each person. Again, one's eye sometimes 
encounters a new-dug pile of Jerusalem artichokes. 
[These very cheap tubers are certainly not artichokes, 
and they have no connection with Jerusalem, their 
English name being corrupted from girasol which 
means that the plants try to turn themselves towards 
the sun.] With the good and sound Jerusalem arti- 
chokes a cook makes a Crdme Palestine ; and a dinner 
which begins with Creme Palestine must be so care- 
fully thought out, with a view to a proper sequence 
and contrast of colours and textures and flavours, that 
all the other buying for the day may turn on this pivot. 
Occasionally there is an abundance of fresh mush- 
rooms at a low price, and, when this happens, a cook 
will not neglect her opportunity. 



Another shopman whom we must visit now and 
then calls himself rather arrogantly the Provision 
Merchant. He sells Cheshire cheese and York ham 
and Irish bacon and new-laid eggs '' from his own 
farm," as well as some cheese and ham and bacon and 
eggs which have made rather longer journeys. In 
these days he is constantly adding other " lines," such 
as poultry. New Zealand lamb, tinned fish, and jam. 
He is also adopting, in many cases when he ought to 
know better, undignified methods of pushing the sale 
of "overweight " nut butter and margarine, a pound 
and a half being sold at the price of a pound, with 
perhaps an aluminium butter-knife thrown in. In his 
Cheddar cheese department there are often clear 



58 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

proofs that he is an Imperialist, free from parish- 
pump narrowness, and that he feels bound to encour- 
age the nascent agriculture of Canada and our other 
great dominions overseas. Happily, some of his tribe 
carry on their business honourably, and when these 
are found their customers will naturally stick to them. 
The good provision merchant generally prefers a 
quiet window, furnished with a stack of flitches of 
bacon and a few cheeses ; but his baser rival loves a 
garish front and is usually trumpeting some coupon- 
scheme so as to reconcile you to his coarse sardines 
and rank tea. 



Of the twentieth-century grocer it is hard to speak 
with brotherly love. At one time the epicier (or 
" spicer "), as the French call him, was something of 
an artist. With the peculiarities of the local water 
supply before him, he blended tea so sensitively that 
no packet tea would have had a chance against it. 
He received many of his materials in the rough and 
in the unready. Turning a great wheel adorned with 
gilded lions or dragons, his apprentices cut loaves of 
sugar in cubes, while the sons of bishops and the 
nephews of admirals stared in through the window 
and bitterly cursed the hard fate which had caused 
them to be born too high in the social scale. The 
grocer had blue and white jars, and lacquered boxes, 
and baby drawers, and scoops big and little. As you 
looked at his stock it was hard to believe that it had 
not been brought to him in an argosy or on pack-mules. 
To-day's grocer is not out of the same batch. All 
that his young men know of the particular packet of 



GOING TO MARKET 59 

jar or tin can which they are selling is that it is 
" eleven three farthings " ; that the packers are 
splendid people ; that they are selling quite a lot of it ; 
and that they have another kind at " ten and a half." 
This sort of young man has memorised a price-list ; 
but instead of having all the seas and orchards and 
spice gardens and cornfields of the world before his 
eyes, his mental picture gallery is furnished with 
nothing but labels and show cards. 

In some books on housekeeping it is recommended 
that one ought to search out the grocers who still 
do their work in the old way, and some trustful young 
matrons therefore patronise none but shops with nice 
placards concerning ' ' Our own blend. ' ' A few genuine 
old grocers' shops survive which may be almost in- 
fallibly distinguished by their atmosphere when one 
is not guided to them by their reputation. But most 
of the " Own blend " shops are delusions. Most of 
them. Not all. The exceptional grocers who put 
skill and conscience into the choice of their own brands 
(even though they may do the actual bu3ang and 
blending and packing by proxy) give the best value 
in the world. The proof is in the eating and drinking ; 
and when a tradesman of this kind has convinced you 
that he is a man of brains and character you ought, 
as I have advised in the foregoing pages, to trust him 
and to make use of his experience. 

There is one kind of grocer from whom I have never 
obtained, and never expect to obtain, any satisfaction. 
I refer to the kind of man who seems to revel in ugli- 
ness. When "a, new neighbourhood," as he would 
call it, is opened up by the speculative builder, this 
kind of grocer-man is one of the first to arrive upon 



6o HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

the scene. His chosen pitch may be close to an old 
grey bridge or a timber cottage or a grand grove of 
elms ; but this makes no difference. Up go his yellow 
bricks and his blue slates, and in goes his sheet of 
plate glass, behind which he is yearning to show 
P5n:amids of orange-coloured cartons, tomato tins 
labelled in flaming scarlet, and show cards with skim- 
milk-white letters on backgrounds of the most odious 
royal blue. If a man should propose to preoccupy the 
same bit of ground with a whitewashed inn, where 
nut-brown ale and brown bread and honest cheese 
would be sold to the pleasant swinging of a signboard 
with a running horse on it, he would not be allowed 
to move an inch without the permission of the Bench. 
Surely there ought to be some sort of a Bench to 
license the grocer and to see that he neither disfigures 
the landscape nor poisons the inhabitants. More 
often than not these shops — I beg their pardon, these 
" stores " — are stocked with " lines " chosen merely 
as " sellers " at the very lowest prices. When there 
has been no other grocer to turn to, I have sometimes 
bought stuff at these places. The proprietors gener- 
ally exhibit a certain proportion of well-known brands, 
partly because some of their customers insist on these 
and partly to make a respectable show, but they are 
always endeavouring to sell the just as good. For- 
tunately the " just as good " has to conform to the 
law, and I have often found words in small type on 
the labels which have been useful as clues to the nature 
of the shop. The strawberry jam is made from the 
choicest Kent strawberries (large type) " improved " 
(small type) with ** other choice fruits." The mustard 
turns out to be "blended with the choicest farine,'* 



GOING TO MARKET 6i 

and so on, until one gets the impression that if it 
were not for the Food and Drugs Act hardly an honest 
article would cross the counter. The poor are cruelly 
imposed upon at this kind of shop. To save a penny 
in the shilling they let themselves be cheated out of 
threepence, and, in some cases, they get deleterious 
ingredients into the bargain. Even educated house- 
wives often fail to read labels and to use common- 
sense. I have seen baking powders and vinegars which 
might have been the deadly inventions of German 
spies improving on the slow old process of poisoning 
the wells. Fortunately, however, demand governs 
supply, and there are so many sensible women who 
will not be put off with shams and rubbish that it is 
possible nearly everywhere to find a grocery stocked 
with good things. Indeed I have heard a grocer say 
quite cynically that he had tried both methods and 
that honesty was the only paying policy for a high- 
class trade. 

A housekeeper, having found the best shop, should 
often visit it herself. All kinds of new imports keep 
coming along, as well as all kinds of new sauces and 
materials for sweets and savouries. As she walks 
about the shop, waiting for change or for some informa- 
tion, many a notion will strike the resourceful cook. 
Forgotten stores in her own pantry come back to her 
mind, or she remembers once favourite dishes which 
she has somehow ceased to serve. It is for some such 
reason as this that I have never myself felt quite 
happy in dealing with the huge Stores. As soon as 
a housekeeper finally loses all patience with small 
and personally-managed local shops, and decides to 
order everything by telephone or post card from the 



62 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

Stores, she saves herself many little worries, but cuts 
herself off from all-alive housekeeping and drifts nine 
times out of ten into the monotony which is the chief 
defect of our English cuisine. 



The baker follows a calling of exceeding dignity. 
In London and our greater towns hardly anybody 
kneads and bakes in her own house to-day. It is 
through the baker that we can eat each day our daily 
bread, and it would be ungenerous to deny that he 
often does his best. While millers and bakers are not 
always as white as they are dusted, I think their inner 
blackness has been exaggerated, and that few of them 
spend the silent night in adding chalk to the flour 
and sand to the household bread. But while there 
are not vast numbers of knaves among them, it must 
be admitted that they do not all bake well. Should 
any reader of this book be so unlucky as to live in a 
place without a good baker, I urge her not to sit down 
too meekly under the loss. Good bread is of such 
obvious importance that I must almost apologise for 
saying so. Where good household bread is not to be 
got, let the housewife try to get into touch with some- 
body who supplies yeast, and let her set about that 
hard but honourable task which will fill her soul with 
just pride and her cupboard with honest loaves. 
Failing yeast, one can fall back on German barm — 
which, by the way, is not all made in Germany. 
Failing the barm, the chemist must be asked for three 
ounces of bicarbonate of soda and two ounces of 
tartaric acid, which must be well mixed in three ounces 
of ordinary arrowroot. If kept dry this baking 



GOING TO MARKET 63 

powder will be found all that is desirable, and it will 
enable any careful cook to turn out wholesome bread. 
Such bread should be made of a mixture of four parts 
of wheat meal (not too coarse) to one part of fine flour. 
Suppose you are using two pounds of the mixture. 
Along with a heaped tablespoonful of baking powder 
and a little salt there ought to be about two ounces 
of butter. Use either milk and water or milk alone 
to make an almost liquid dough which should be 
baked in very shallow round tins not much more than 
an inch high. The baking powder (like a Seidlitz 
powder) generates innumerable little bubbles which 
give lightness to the bread. It is essential therefore 
to begin the baking in a hot oven, so that the outside 
of the fiat loaf or cake may be sealed hard, thus im- 
prisoning the bubbles. [Although it is nothing to do 
with bakers or baking, I will say in this place that the 
principle of sealing applies to grilling also, and indeed 
to many actions in cookery.] 

The foregoing directions are borrowed from Sir 
Henry Thompson, with one addition. The otherwise 
admirable Sir Henry does not appear to have been a 
practical cook, and he therefore wrote : " Mix with a 
sufficient quantity of baking powder." Such vague 
expressions as " a sufficient quantity " are the despair 
of the novice. I admit that, in the following chapters, 
I shall often use vague language myself, but only as 
regards seasonings, and degrees of richness, or in 
connection with materials which (unlike our baking 
powder) are of varying strength. 

In buying flour from the baker it is a good thing to 
tell him quite candidly what you do and do not want. 
The much-despised finest white flour still has many 



64 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

uses in the kitchen, despite its low nutritive value ; 
but for your bread you require such flour as used to be 
called seconds and is now more generally spoken of 
under the names of " standard " and " household." 
The finest oatmeal, and other flours not ground from 
wheat, are important ; but they can only be used 
confidently after several experiments. 

In our own day and generation bread is too often 
wasted. Years ago an almost religious reverence 
surrounded bread. You could waste other things ; 
but never bread. My own childhood was embittered 
as the result of my having thrown away in a moment 
of petulance a horrible slice of bread, with crust burnt 
almost black and a doughy crumb. My brothers and 
sisters could throw away apples over the hedge after 
sampling them with a single bite ; or they could leave 
half-a-slice of roast sirloin on the plate, with impunity ; 
but my sin in throwing away that piece of bread was 
never allowed to die. When an old Welsh nurse 
called to see me after a few years of absence one of her 
first questions was directed to this hateful subject, and 
she did not go away without telling me a blood-chilling 
narrative about a boy who threw away a piece of 
bread and perished miserably a few months after- 
wards, on a raft in the Indian Ocean, without so much 
as a ship's biscuit. Nevertheless I do not wholly 
succeed in despising this old sentiment. Bread, quite 
apart from its high use in the Christian mysteries, has 
a human sanctity as the stoutest staff of life. To 
waste it at any time is not good. To waste it in war- 
time is an unspiritual as well as a selfish action. 
Frangois Coppee brought out this feeling very beauti- 
fully in his httle story of the siege of Paris called : ** A 



GOING TO MARKET 65 

Morsel of Bread." We do not expect a siege of 
London, but let us take our bread-pans seriously all 
the same. It is far better to calculate the bread con- 
sumption beforehand than to find the bowl littered 
with fragments which have to be worked off by some 
of the worst makeshifts of cookery. In many houses 
the surplus bread is got rid of in the form of bread-and- 
butter pudding. In denouncing bread-and-butter 
pudding I know that I shall fall foul of many people, 
including those who have lately been advertising the 
currant trade. But bread-and-butter pudding, and 
soups in which there is a whole sli-ce of soddened 
bread, present a serious danger. Those who eat 
them, especially children, are prone to bolt such 
soft food without proper mastication. Now it is an 
established fact that starchy substances like bread 
must be well worked (salivated) in the mouth before 
they are swallowed. From some points of view it is 
less dangerous to bolt small lumps of beef or mutton 
than equal lumps of cake or bread. A bread-and- 
butter pudding, made with currants that are not 
too skinny and with good milk, can be a valuable diet 
to the few who will eat it properly ; but it is generally 
better to avoid the need for making it by a more jealous 
watch over the buying of bread. There will be an 
overplus sometimes ; and then the breadcrumb 
is best used in a steamed suet pudding where it is 
lighter than flour. Flavoured with marmalade, or 
ginger, or chocolate, such puddings are good. 



The dairyman is hedged about with legal enact» 
ments which ought to keep him straight. The law, 

E 



66 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

however, allows him a certain amount of elbow-room 
as regards the minimum of solids in milk, so as to 
protect him in the event of his receiving in good faith 
an unusually poor milk from the farmer. The baser 
sort of dair37man always waters down the milk to this 
minimum, while the better sort gives his customers 
a far purer article, with more cream, at the same price 
per quart. Milk, like bread, is often bought waste- 
fuUy. Still, some waste is bound to occur in houses 
where daily habits are not absolutely regular. As the 
milkman is early astir with a fast white horse and great 
brass milk-cans, shining in the early sunshine like 
burnished helmets, he must be able to depend upon a 
certain regular round of customers. Thus it would 
not be fair to thrust one's head out of the bathroom 
window once or twice a week and to countermand the 
little standing order. Even when the mistress of a 
tiny household suddenly decides that she and her 
consort will drink China tea instead of cafe au lait, 
it is she and not the milkman who ought to find a 
way of disposing of the unwanted pint of milk. In 
too many houses it is placed aside, and when the 
cream has been skimmed from it a few hours later 
it is allowed to go sour. Sour milk can be used for 
certain kinds of hot cakes ; but this disposes of very 
small quantities only. It is therefore far better to 
use any surplus milk while it is sweet. A good rice 
pudding with or without stewed fruit or preserve is 
excellent home food. Milk is also wanted for so many 
soups and sauces that not a drop of it need be lost. 



Happy is the housewife who never has a disappoint- 



GOING TO MARKET 67 

ment with her butter and her eggs. I shall not attempt 
to offer her much more than my sympathy and good 
wishes. But perhaps I may say that slightly salted 
butter is often better value than any other. Some of 
the cooking butters at about a shilling a pound are not 
cheap in the long run ; indeed the best professional 
cooks have been known to say that they find it more 
economical to buy cooking butter at a higher price 
than the ordinary fresh dairy butter, which they make 
into little pats for the table. This remark, however, 
applies more to classical dishes than to the kind of 
cookery contemplated throughout this book. 

Butter should be bought in small quantities. I have 
used various patent contrivances for keeping it sweet 
in hot weather, and have found them good in theory, 
especially one which sucks up cold water into a 
muslin cover ; but day-by-day buying is the best plan. 
It goes without saying that, even when it is kept in a 
larder for not more than a few hours, butter should 
not be placed near any foods which smell strongly. 

Intelligent and well-reared people tell me that the 
best makes of margarine are so much better than their 
predecessors that they can be used for nearly all the 
purposes of dairy butter. My own experience has 
been less fortunate, but, if the North Sea should have 
to be closed to Danish and Scandinavian vessels by 
reason of further German mine-laying, it might be- 
come necessary for most of us to give margarine 
another trial. I am referring to its use for cut bread 
and butter and for dishes served in butter newly 
melted, where margarine may fail horribly. Mean- 
while, however, every housewife ought to be using 
in ordinary cookery the vegetable butters which are 



68 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

no dearer than lard and are less objectionable in 
several respects. I used to buy a butter of this kind 
from Marseilles, which was as white as driven snow. 
It seems to be no longer generally sold in England ; 
but there are British brands, such as cocoanut butters, 
which any first -class grocer can supply. 

Eggs are eggs, according to an inscrutable proverb. 
Why the egg should have been thus chosen to express 
fixity and certainty I cannot guess : because eggs 
were deceivers ever. " New laid " may mean laid 
this morning or laid last Saturday week. " Fresh " 
means in most shops an egg not fresh enough to be 
basketed with the oldest of the " new laid." And 
even when the question of age has been decided it 
does not follow that two lots of eggs, both laid on the 
same day, ought to be sold at the same price. Buy 
three separate dozens of new-laid eggs at three separate 
shops, paying the same money at each, and weigh 
your purchases at home. You may find that you have 
obtained three or four pennyworth more egg-value 
at the best shop than at the worst. 

The many substitutes for eggs are useful when 
custards have to be provided cheaply in large quan- 
tities for healthy and hungry children. But if you 
have a wounded or convalescent soldier in the house, 
of course you will not use these things. Speaking 
for myself, I have never found anything else to do 
the work of an egg ; and when eggs are too dear it 
is better to abandon all dishes in which they have to 
be used freely. 

In thousands of houses breakfast eggs are still 
cooked in boiling water. They are easier to digest 
and better to eat if they are laid in cold water and 



GOING TO MARKET 69 

brought gradually to the boiling point. One or two 
experiments (which will need modifying according 
to the age and size of the e§g) will soon teach you how 
many seconds the egg should be left in the water after 
it has begun to boil and bubble. 



So much for Going to Market. The chapter would 
have been shorter if I had not paused here and there 
to give hints for cooking rather than for shopping : 
but I have noticed that remarks made in passing are 
remembered when formal recipes are forgotten. 



CHAPTER IV 

HORS d'CEUVRE 

When he heard that there was to be a chapter in it 
on hors d'ceuvre, a kind friend who has been teUing 
me how not to write this book completely lost his 
patience. He appeared to think that hors d'ceuvre 
in war-time were about as decent as nigger minstrels 
at a funeral. As others -v^dll share his feeling, I take 
leave to relate at this stage a Moral Tale. 



About twelve years ago the two nephews of a 
worthy couple in Shropshire were married in the same 
month to the two maidens of their choice. Although 
these were not their names, I will say that Reginald 
married Janet and that Wilfred married Dorothy. 
Both young couples established their Earthly 
Paradises in London, whither the Worthy Couple 
came to visit them every spring. Janet's house was 
solidly and sombrely furnished with " everything 
good." And " everything good " was the governing 
motto of Janet's table. Her soups were so strongly 
prepared from gravy-beef that they took away your 
appetite for the rest of the dinner ; which was a serious 
matter, as the dishes which followed were all equally 
" good," while the brown sherry and almost black 
Burgundy were chosen to match. Dorothy's house, 
on the other hand, was light and bright. When she 

70 



HORS D'CEUVRE 71 

was trotting about the town furnishing it, this lively 
damsel shocked more than one tradesman by telling 
him that the articles which would " last a lifetime " 
v/ere just what she didn't want. Dorothy spent less 
than half as much as Janet at the outset, and kept 
a tidy sum in the bank against the day when she would 
get sick of some of her chairs and tables. 

It was noticed that the Worthy Couple invariably 
found their sojourn with Janet something of a trial, 
and that they generally produced a pretext for migrat- 
ing to Dorothy's about the middle of the second week. 
During their stay at Dorothy's they even seemed to 
become a little younger. Yet somehow the Worthy 
Couple, when they returned to Shropshire, always 
expressed satisfaction with Janet and some uneasiness 
in regard to Dorothy. They were persuaded that 
Janet and her husband would never give them a 
moment's anxiety ; but they seemed to be inwardly 
convinced that Dorothy and Wilfrid were on the 
paths which lead slowly to the two disreputable Courts 
of Bankruptcy and Divorce. I once made bold to 
ask the better half of the Worthy Couple (during the 
absence of the worse half) for light upon this curious 
situation. I learned that Janet (who, to my certain 
knowledge, is an unpunctual and unhappy and dull 
and useless lady) was " always so sensible and re- 
liable," while Dorothy (whom I know to be a woman 
who gets through an enormous amount of her own 
and other people's work without fuss) was " awfully 
nice but such a butterfly," W^hen I expressed sur- 
prise, I was given an illustration of Dorothy's flippancy 
and extravagance. It appeared that the Worthy 
Couple had lately dined at Dorothy's house and had 



72 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

enjoyed themselves as usual. They had protested, 
however, against so much kind fuss being made in 
honour of their visit, and had especially deplored the 
troublesome though delicious hors d'oeuvre ; where- 
upon Dorothy had instantly retorted : " We have 
hors d'oeuvre every night except Sunday." 

I took it upon myself to argue that Dorothy's gay 
little dinners, so full of pleasant and wholesome 
variety, with their accompaniment of well-bought and 
well-served cheap and brisk wines, must certainly cost 
Dorothy much less than she would have to spend on 
giving such dinners as Janet's. But my words were 
vain, and I was made to feel that it was not quite nice 
for a mere man to pretend to understand housekeeping 
and cookery. When the Worthy Couple died (with 
faithful unanimity) a year or two later, they left 
£ii,ooo to the Janet household and £1000 to Dorothy 
and her husband ; having previously explained to 
their solicitor that they hated to make such a dis- 
tinction, but that it would be more harmful than kind 
to leave money where it would only be frittered away. 



To the shallow and unthinking this Moral Tale may 
seem to show that if we eschew hors d'oeuvre we may 
be thousands of pounds in pocket. The true moral, 
however, will be plain enough to ninety-nine readers 
out of a hundred. What shall it profit a Janet or 
any other woman to inherit a lot of money and lead 
a dismal and dyspeptic Hfe ? And what shall a 
Dorothy or any other woman give in exchange for 
her soul ? 

My tale about hors d'oeuvre is to be taken as itself 



HORS D'CEUVRE 73 

a kind of hors d'oeuvre, ushering in this and my re- 
maining chapters. The point is that Dorothy's hors 
d'oeuvre cost her practically nothing. If she had 
found the recipes in a cookery-book and had bought 
the ingredients expressly they would have cost her 
perhaps two or three shillings ; but, although they 
were good and looked almost extravagant, they added 
nothing to her expenses as a hostess. Every one of 
them was what might be called a by-product of the 
general housekeeping. Besides, knowing that the 
hors d'oeuvre would be enjoyed, this clever hostess 
provided fish and meat a little more sparingly and 
thus saved the cost of the condiments and butter in 
the hors d'oeuvre. In short, she worked upon the 
principles which were laid down in an earlier chapter 
of this book as the foundation of economical house- 
keeping both in peace-time and in war-time — the 
great principles of using what you have rather than 
what you haven't and of working from the market 
to the menu rather than from the menu to the market. 



Hors d'oeuvre, while helping a housewife to save, 
will also take the sting out of the economies. I have 
noticed scores of times the pleasure and eagerness 
with which English people fall upon the hors d'oeuvre 
when they go to lunch or dine at a fixed-price restaur- 
ant ; yet the same people rarely eat such things in 
their own homes. After the War we shall be more 
friendly than ever with the Russians and the French — 
two peoples who understand hors d'oeuvre thoroughly 
— and we might as well begin to adopt their best 
practices at once. 



74 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

It has been explained in earlier passages that this 
book is not a substitute for the ordinary cookery- 
books wherein scores of hors d'ceuvre are described. 
I shall therefore give about half-a-dozen recipes only, 
every one of which presupposes the existence of small 
portions of left-over food in the larder. The first 
shall be Cucumber Cups. Perhaps you had on Friday 
some salmon and cucumber. You did not cut up and 
serve the whole of the cucumber there and then, but 
you left half of it — the half with the stalk end — 
standing point downwards in a jar of water. On 
Saturday you could take this remaining half and, 
having peeled it, you could cut it into a few sections, 
the shape of drums. That is to say, instead of 
cutting a piece of cucumber five inches long into 
forty or fifty thin slices, you cut it into four or five 
pieces only. By standing up these drum-shaped 
sections, after steaming them until they are tender 
without being sloppy, it is easy to scoop out the seeds 
and to bevel the apertures to the shape of a cup or 
a funnel. The next step is to apply our great prin- 
ciple of using what you have rather than of buying 
something especially to complete the dish. For 
example, if a little of the Friday salmon remains, it 
can be mixed with some mayonnaise and laid inside 
the cucumber. Or some tiny pieces of chicken, too 
tiny for any other purpose, can be similarly mixed 
with mayonnaise and put in the cups. Or some of 
the potted fish already recommended will do. Set the 
cups aside and serve them quite cold. 



As you will not want to turn every half-cucumber 



HORS D (EUVRE 75 

you may have into cucumber cups, or as you may 
sometimes lack fish or chicken to put inside, you 
must learn how to serve simple slices of cucumber 
in such a way that they will be found digestible even 
by people who are generally afraid of this cooling 
vegetable. 

Having peeled and sliced your cucumber, lay the 
slices in a saucer with a sprinkling of salt and let 
them stand until a good brine has formed. Pour away 
this brine, and with it you will get rid of the elements 
that are injurious. Pepper the slices. Do not salt 
them again. Pour over them some pure olive oil 
and turn them over and over in it. Just before 
serving, add a little good vinegar and turn them over 
and over again. 

On a day of abstinence, you can make a fine show 
with salads in this manner. Fully ripe but still firm 
tomatoes can be neatly sliced with a sharp knife 
and served with pepper, salt, oil and vinegar ; but 
in this case the dressing should be well mixed to- 
gether in a cup and poured over the slices of tomato, 
which would break up into an unattractive mess if 
you tried to turn them over in the oil and vinegar. 
Cold French beans are excellent in this style, but the 
proportion of vinegar should be rather greater than 
in most other salads. Neat sprigs of cold boiled 
cauliflower can be served in the same way, though it 
is better to keep a fairly large piece of the cauliflower 
unbroken and to cover it with mayonnaise. To 
extend your colour scheme, you can make also a 
salad of beetroot. To do this you cut a boiled beet 
into sn; all dice, sprinkle a little chopped parsley over 
it, and add a mixture of three parts of oil to two of 



76 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

vinegar. Many people add a few fragments from 
fillets of herring and also a finely chopped onion to 
this salad, but it must be remembered that raw onion 
cannot be offered to everybody. I ought to add that 
a beetroot salad is said to be a little fattening and 
gouty, by reason of the sugar in the beet and the oil 
in the dressing, but there are no bad effects unless it is 
devoured excessively. If you do not eat all these 
salad hors d'oeuvre at one meal, they can be mixed to- 
gether (adding the tomato last) with any large pieces 
of cold steamed fish, or with little squares cut from a 
ham or a sirloin which has already been carved down 
almost to the bone, or with pieces (not too large) from 
such cheap cold meats as the flank and brisket men- 
tioned on a preceding page. A few slices of cold 
potato, which must be kept in shape like the tomato, 
ought to be added to the salad when pieces of meat 
are in it. This combination salad, however, although 
made from your hors d'oeuvre (which in their own 
turn were made from your cold vegetables) is not 
itself to be served as hors d'oeuvre, because it will 
be big and important enough for the central dish 
in a famify luncheon on any warm day. 



Although I have bewailed the dearness of eggs, I 
shall not be deemed extravagant if I try to suggest 
two simple and picturesque hors d'oeu^Te which will 
require only one egg for the pair. Boil the egg hard. 
Shell it carefully, cut it open lengthwise and pound 
up the yolk with good butter (softened on the stove) 
und with a little good essence of anchovies, or 
anchovy sauce, which I assume you keep in the house 



HORS D'OEUVRE 77 

to serve with the more insipid kinds of fish. This 

anchovy paste or butter can be made so mild that 
it will do for afternoon-tea sandwiches and will 
delight the many ladies who hate ordinary anchovies 
and look upon them as a man's taste. For use as 
hors d'oeuvre the paste can be served in a dozen 
ways or it can be held back for a savoury. And now 
for the other hors d'oeuvre. I said a few lines back 
that the hard-boiled egg should be neatly shelled 
and cut open lengthwise, so that when the yolk has 
been taken out the two halves will be like two little 
boats. The boats can be filled with any tasty tit- 
bits which you may have on hand. You can chop 
up a gherkin from the pickle bottle and combine 
it with potted fish or potted meat. If you have 
in the house some of the cheap sheets of rice-paper 
which are used for the bottom of a cake, you can 
place a little mast upright in the middle of the laden 
boat, with a square inch of rice-paper for a sail. 
You prick sharply two tiny holes in the rice-paper 
and thread through them a mast cut from a wooden 
match or broken off from a piece of spaghetti. This 
hors d'oeuvre fascinates children, whom it is our 
duty to amuse occasionally even in times of war 
when we may feel disinclined to do so. 



Against the day when we may be receiving con- 
valescent soldiers into our homes, every cook ought 
to know how to make old-fashioned calf's-foot jelly, 
and when it is about to be made, there will be a chance 
of varying her hors d'oeuvre with a salade de pied de 
veau. In the same category I may mention a salade 



y^ HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

de museau de boeuf. This sounds better in French 
than in EngUsh, as an ox-cheek was thought vulgar 
as long ago as the day when Goldsmith's incompara- 
able Mr Tibbs invited a lord to dinner. Ox-cheek, 
however, after being cooked tender, will furnish a 
good little dish, with oil and vinegar. I ought to say 
at this stage that the oft-despised gelatinous parts 
of the ox and the calf have value as food. 



Should a cold sausage exist in your pantry you may 
cut it into small drums and garnish the top of each 
drum with a neat little dab of horse-radish cream or 
apple chutney. And fragments of cold boiled ham 
can be rolled into the shape of cornettes, having been 
first lightly touched inside with a smear of mustard 
into which you have put a few drops of vinegar. 



So much for hors d'oeuvre worked up from odds 
and ends. In war-time, however, it may often suit a 
housekeeper to amplify the hors d'oeuvre and to omit 
soup and fish, so as to go straight on to a good ragout 
or navarin, which, when followed by some fresh fruit 
and a little cheese, would make a good enough meal 
for anybody. On such occasions quite a large quan- 
tity of hors d'oeuvre can be provided without much 
expense. I sometimes take an ordinary dinner-plate 
(or, better still, a white plaque which is slightly con- 
cave and has no brim) and upon it I arrange a dozen 
or two of the very cheap little fish known as Norwegian 
smoked sardines. I arrange them after the pattern 
of a rimless wheel, with the tails of the fish meeting 



HORS D'CEUVRE 79 

and touching in a ring at the hub and with the 
shoulders pointing towards the circumferance. This 
wheel of fish has a handsome and important appearance. 
Should some of the sardines be left uneaten, they 
should be laid at the bottom of a soup-plate and 
covered with their own or any other good oil. 



A tin of filets d'hareng is useful. A little oil will 
preserve the contents a long time after it has been 
opened. 

Two dishes of olives, green and black, are worth 
more than the money they cost. I have often been 
told that they soon dry up, but this difficulty is got 
over by keeping them in salted water and by buying 
them in small quantities only. Olives are not only 
delightful cleansers of the palate but they lend them- 
selves to many uses. Every housekeeper should 
learn to turn an olive — that is to say, how to remove 
the stone. You cut off a small piece from the stalk 
end, so that the olive can stand upright. Then, 
taking a penknife with a narrow blade and a sharp 
point, you begin to peel the olive, pretty much as you 
would peel an apple, so as to disengage the stone. 
You should learn to " turn " the olive in about three 
folds of the spiral. If you have done the job pro- 
perly, the olive will resume its shape after the stone 
comes away, and you can stuff it with a rolled fillet 
of anchovy or with anything else that is suitable. 

Salted nuts are nearly always popular and, when 
consumed in moderation, they are a valuable addition 
to a prudent dietary. It is better to salt your own 



% 



8o HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

nuts than to buy them ready-made in a shop. Blanch 
your almonds, or whatever the nuts may be, and dry 
them well. Pour about a dessertspoonful of fine 
olive oil into a perfectly clean baking-tin and see that 
the oil spreads itself out evenly. Lay the blanched 
kernels in the tin and put them in a fairly hot oven. 
Turn them over several times until they take a 
pleasant brown hue. Turn them out upon a sheet of 
white paper (to absorb the oil) and dust them over 
with perfectly dry table-salt. So long as you protect 
them from damp, they will keep a long time in a tin 
box or a stoppered bottle. When Brazil nuts are at 
their best, from March to September, I prepare them 
in a similar manner. With a little practice, Brazil 
nuts can be cracked without breaking the kernel. 
After the blanching, I cut fine white slices with a 
sharp knife and submit them to the process of brown- 
ing and salting already described. Such hors d'oeuvre 
as stuffed olives and salted Brazil nuts will strike 
many people as wickedly extravagant luxuries, but 
they are really cheaper than many less nutritious and 
more commonplace foods. 



A plate of radishes looks well and is good for our 
health. It is a pity to trim the radishes more than is 
necessary, as the colours of their roots and leaves 
are large parts of their charm. Tiny pats of butter 
ought to accompany them. For a few pence one 
can buy a plated tool which, after a dip in hot water, 
enables even a child to make pats of butter in the 
pretty shell-shape of the great restaurants. 

Speaking with bated breath, I must record the 



HORS D'CEUVRE 8i 

indisputable fact that a dish of the youngest spring 
onions goes very well with radishes. At the same 
time I admit that there are still polite circles where 
raw onions must not be named. So here is a way of 
presenting onions in such a manner that they will lose 
all their disadvantages while keeping nearly all their 
attractions. Take a fire-proof dish and put in it a 
mixture of oil and vinegar with such herbs as you 
may possess. Bring the oil and vinegar to boiling 
point. Then lay in the dish some fine round onions — 
the small kind, such as one uses with chickens cooked 
in a casserole. These onions ought not to be more 
than an inch in diameter. Of course their outside 
skins are removed before you cook them. Maintain 
the contents of the dish at boiling point for a minute 
or two ; then draw it to the side of the fire or put it 
over the smallest possible jet of gas and keep it sim- 
mering. No exact time for the whole operation can 
be given, as some onions are tougher than others. 
Indeed, a tough onion may require the adding of a 
little water to the vinegar and oil. As soon as the 
onions are tender, transfer the contents of the fire- 
proof dish to a glass bowl, oil and vinegar and all, 
and let the onions become quite cold. The next day p. 
they will be delicious. I have seen a woman who has 
a horror of onions take three helpings from this dish 
of hors d'ceuvre. Onions thus cooked will keep three 
or four days in the liquor. 



This little book will have failed of its object if it 
does not stimulate readers to invent hors d'ceuvre 
and other dishes of their own. So we will pass on.

But before doing so I must point out that the hors 
d'oeuvre in this chapter would displease professional 
cooks and restaurateurs for a very simple reason. 
In the regular cookery-books hors d'oeuvre are defined 
as dainty little snacks to whet the appetite. They 
are, in the world of solids, what aperitifs are in the 
world of liquids. But, as this is not a book for the 
pampering of great people, I have preferred to de- 
scribe those hors d'oeuvre which do not whet appetites 
but satisfy them. I could write a good deal about 
canapes, and smoked salmon from the Lurlei rock, 
and about caviare, and plovers' eggs ; but these 
prescriptions must be reserved for another book on 
" Home Cookery in the Time of Victory." 



CHAPTER V 

SOUPS 

Not everyone who buys this book will read it through 
from the first page to the last. Despite the v/arning in 
the preface, some will take it from the shelf, and open 
it at this chapter or that, in order to find the sum- 
total of human wisdom on the matter to which the 
chapter-heading refers. I am therefore compelled 
to repeat over and over again that this little volume 
is not a substitute for the more orderly and detailed 
cookery-book. It is in the nature of a tract, recalling 
indifferent cooks who have lapsed from grace to the 
more fervid practice of their high calling, and stirring 
up those who have never cooked to begin cooking now. 



My most important paragraph about soups will not 
contain a recipe. It will be, and hereby is, an en- 
treaty to take down a good cookery-book and to run 
rapidly through the chapter on soups. Let this 
quick perusal be made pencil in hand and let the 
likely soups be marked with a cross. By the likely 
I mean those which are easily prepared from acces- 
sible, fresh, inexpensive, nutritious and appetising 
materials. For example, a cook who reads all about 
soups in October will not mark as a matter of urgency 
a soup which can be made only with fresh green peas. 
Nor will a wise cook grow excited over a plan for using 

83 



84 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

lentils or split peas or dried haricot beans at a time 
when the markets are overflowing with artichokes, 
carrots, cauliflower, sorrel, cress, leeks, lettuce, 
celery and turnips. Most cookery-books contain 
recipes for hundreds of concoctions which you would 
never dream of making, just as most bookshops con- 
tain hundreds of books which you would never dream 
of reading. Get into your mind the comparatively 
small number of timely and practicable soups. Then, 
instead of deciding that you will immediately set 
about making a particular soup irrespective of its 
convenience, look round your pantry or set out for 
the market. If the pantry, for instance, should con- 
tain the remains of a chicken, your way is plain. If, 
however, the cupboard is bare and you find at the 
greengrocer's shop that fine cauliflowers are unusually 
cheap, there will flash into your mind the recipe for 
a Creme Dubarry. Or you may remember that you 
have some cream to spare, skimmed from a surplus 
of the morning's milk, in which event it wiU be easy 
to make a very healthy and satisfying sorrel soup 
or a Creme de Sante. [At a house near Hampstead, 
where the garden is not much bigger than the dining- 
room, I once had the pleasure of finding enough 
sorrel to make a Creme de Sante which was more than 
a success.] Perhaps you have been boiling a fish, 
and you have some fish stock which you do not know 
what to do with. By shredding up about half-a- 
pound of raw white fish and by adding the shells and 
whites of two eggs, and by beating the mixture of 
stock and fish and eggs over the fire until a froth rises, 
you wiU have gone a long way towards making an 
unconventional consomme of fish. This soup is a 



SOUPS 85 

little troublesome, because it has to be strained through 
muslin and heated up again afterwards ; but if your 
fish stock is good to begin with, and if you have been 
so fortunate as to have a glass of Chablis or any other 
good dry white wine to throw in, you will not be 
ashamed of the result. In short, we are back for the 
fourth or fifth time to our root principle of the market 
or larder first and the choice of dishes afterwards. 



Before setting down some hints for one or two soups 
which your English cookery-book may not teach you 
to make so well, I must try to explain why soup has 
not been popular in England. English soups are 
generally either too poor or too " good.'' When soup 
is made for distribution from charitable kitchens, it 
is too often a crude production most trying to the 
stomachs of the poor creatures who have been short 
of their usual solid food. Far too reckless a use is 
made of dry pulse. I assisted some years ago at the 
free distribution of soup in a London parish, and 
was shocked to find that it was made on the same 
formula every day, until the recipients, in spite of 
their hunger, began to hate the sight of it. With no 
greater expenditure for materials, it would have been 
possible to have avoided this disgust while enormously 
increasing the dietetic value of the gifts. At the other 
extreme, we find people despising every soup which is 
not the quintessence of the most costly materials. 
In some quarters soup must be made from real turtle, 
or from the pick of prime beef, or from fresh lobsters, 
or from whole chickens before they will look at it. 
I know men, especially city men, who have no use 



86 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

at all for a perfect little French soup which stimulates 
the gastric juices and launches the whole dinner on 
its proper voyage. Yet these same men are highly 
pleased when they are given a plateful of appetite- 
killing meat-essence in which some leathery oysters 
or a poached egg can be seen floating horribly, like 
jelly-fish in the tide. By a *' good " soup our English 
cooks too often mean a soup which has been made 
as if no other dish of fish, flesh or fowl is to follow it. 



Speaking generally, the housekeeper who relies 
upon large reserves of soups from the grocer's, either 
dry in packets or wet in bottles, is in a pitiable con- 
dition. I grant that in flats or cottages, where the 
staff is very small, one may do worse than keep in 
reserve for emergencies a bottle or two of soup made 
by a first-class English house or a tin of the delicious 
tomato soup packed by an American house whose 
name everybody knows. There are also some squares 
of soup in packets, costing about sixpence each, which 
are useful to meet a sudden call. But, with the ex- 
ception of the tiny gelatine tubes of concentrated con- 
somme, I have never found any of the very cheap 
ready-made soups worth even the small amount of 
money they cost . The low-priced dry soups in packets 
yield a soup with a deadly defect for which I can think 
of no better name than " stuffiness." It is a common 
idea that if you evaporate moisture from meat and 
vegetables to make them portable, and then swell 
them out again with water from a tap, you restore 
them to their original condition. There is no greater 
error. The moisture in a fresh pea is not the same 



SOUPS ^7 

as that which is distributed by the Metropolitan 
Water Board. 



Your cookery-book will tell you a good deal about 
the most important soup in all France and therefore 
in all the world — namely, the Pot-au-feu. But this 
is the best moment for me to point out that I am 
assuming your cookery-book to be a good one, full 
of saving doctrine and undefiled by the ranker heresies 
of English cooking. In order that you may test your 
book, I suggest here and now that you compare its 
prescription for Pot-au-feu with what immediately 
follows. Do not expect your book to use the same 
words as mine and do not be put o££ by trivial or even 
considerable differences of procedure ; but, if your 
book be found, so to speak, to belong to another world 
so far as Pot-au-feu is concerned, you had better go 
and buy a new one. 



Even those who have forgotten most of their 
French know that " feu " means " fire " and that 
" pot " means " pot." So we will begin with a few 
words about the pot and a few more about the fire. 
Our pot, or marmite, or casserole, must be of fire-proof 
clay, and roomy enough to hold the fowl which Henry 
IV. wished every Frenchman to have in the pot on 
a Sunday. The lid must fit closely : because the 
simmering will be protracted through six long hours, 
and not more than a teacupful of liquid should escape 
as vapour from start to finish. 

The fire (or gas-jets) must be so managed that the 



88 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

heat will be both gentle and even. If we use gas, we 
should choose one of the larger rings, with the flame 
turned down very low, thus distributing the heat aU 
over the bottom of the pot. On some gas-stoves it is 
necessary to raise the pot a little above the usual grid, 
by supporting it on two bits of metal, such as pokers. 
The essential point is that the pot-au-feu must never 
boil. It must simmer aU the time. 

Now for the ingredients. A pot-au-feu being primi- 
tive fare, water is the next element to mention after the 
pot of earth and the slow fire. We will pour into the 
casserole two quarts of water, and we will immediately 
add three pounds of shin (or round) of beef, tied 
neatly with white tape or clean string. We will put 
on the lid and set the pot over gentle heat. 

Now we will prepare two large carrots, two turnips 
of medium size, and, if possible, a small parsnip and 
four sticks of celery. We will cut all these into discs 
or cubes. If we have four leeks, we will trim them 
and cut up the white parts. Failing leeks, we will use 
two good onions. We shall also want two dozen black 
peppercorns, three or four cloves, a blade of mace, and, 
if we are French, a garlic clove as well. 

At the end of about an hour we must begin watching 
the liquor which drowns the bit of beef in the pot. As 
soon as a white scum appears, no time must be lost in 
skimming it entirely away. When the skimming is 
finished, we replace the lid till the simmering begins 
again. We can now add our vegetables and season- 
ings, not forgetting a small teaspoonful of salt. 
From this point the cooking must go on, very slowly, 
for four hours more. Finally, we lift out the piece of 
meat, we remove the vegetables, we skim off any 



SOUPS 89 

additional grease — and there is our pot-au-feu. 
[Some cooks facilitate the removal of the vegetables 
by tying them in muslin before putting them in the 
casserole.] The pot-au-feu does not need to be eaten 
the same day. When wanted it can be seasoned and 
eaten as a soup, or it can be made the foundation of all 
kinds of important dishes. We must beware, how- 
ever, of cooking a cabbage in it, if we want the pot-au- 
feu to remain good for more than twenty-four hours. 



Like every other bright light, the glory of Pot-au- 
feu casts a shadow. The piece of boiled beef which 
is left over has to be eaten in thrifty households, and 
the day for eating it is regarded by French papas as a 
kind of Black Monday, just as the English Monday's 
cold beef or mutton was a penance to the London 
husband when he still lived over his shop and took 
his midday meal in the bosom of his family seven 
days a week. The French boiled beef is accompanied 
by boiled carrots and large rough grains of a special 
salt, but neither the carrots nor the gros sel can re- 
concile the Frenchman to his hard lot. It is one more 
proof of the excessive benevolence of Providence to 
males that all kinds of business appointments crop 
up on a boiled-beef day, thus enabling the French 
citizen to eat at a restaurant and to leave Madame and 
the little Jules and the little Madeleine to wrestle 
with the dish. In England and in war-time, if we 
are to have the authentic Pot-au-feu we must face 
the boiled beef as well. And if the beef was good to 
start with : if we have not allowed it to become black 
and dry through being only partially submerged in the 



90 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

broth : and if we will eat it with a small white cabbage 
which has been cut in half and cooked tender in the 
pot-au-feu itself for about forty minutes : then our 
penance will not be too hard for us to bear. 



In the introductory chapter I advised those readers 
who have small establishments to escape from the 
t5n:anny of the all-the-year-round stock-pot. It is 
taken for granted, however, that stock will be fre- 
quently made and that nothing suitable for its pre- 
paration will be wasted. In practice, nevertheless, my 
advice for the makingof particular lots of stock, instead 
of carrying on the stock-pot generally, will be justified 
to such an extent that even the occasional throwing 
away of an ounce or two of scraps may turn out to be 
true economy in the end. 

As soon as you are in possession of stock from a hare, 
or a partridge, or the bone of a boiled ham, or any 
other stock-yielding substance, you must proceed to 
apply the oft-reiterated rule of this book and to build 
upwards and onwards therefrom. Some stocks are 
practically flavourless and to these you may add 
anything you like. Others, especially those made 
from the remains of roast game, are often so flavoury 
that they require nothing more than a thickening. 
With the leavings of a hare and a thickening of red 
haricots you can make a wonderful soup, and it may 
be worth your while to try the experiment of adding 
to it some heated (not boiled) milk just before it is 
served. I have tasted a soup of this kind which 
sufficed for six persons, although very little meat 
remained on the bones of the hare before they were 



SOUPS 91 

taken in hand for soup. The milk would have been 
wasted if this use had not been found for it. So would 
the hare's bones. This meant that the cost to the 
household for the haricots and the fuel worked out 
at about a halfpenny for each person, the tureenful 
of fine soup therefore costing threepence. 



As most of the great cookery-books have been 
written in countries where the abstinence days are 
more or less observed, they nearly all contain elaborate 
directions for making purely vegetable stocks. My 
own practice is to prepare vegetable stocks myself, 
when vegetables are at hand ; but it is not always 
worth while to buy the materials expressly for stock. 
In an earlier chapter I referred to the modern vege- 
table extracts such as " Marmite." [As most readers 
infer, whenever they see a proprietary article men- 
tioned in a cookery-book that the writer has received 
an enormous cheque for his puff, I take leave to state 
that I do not know the proprietor of " Marmite " 
from Adam ; and that he has never given me so much 
as the smallest-sized pot of his preparation.] Pos- 
sibly there are already some better things of the same 
sort, but I have still to meet with them. With this 
kind of extract at hand, the whole art or mystery of 
soup-making is opened to the least experienced. I 
am bound, however, to recognise the fact that you 
will sometimes find yourself overburdened with vege- 
tables suitable for stock-making ; so here are brief 
directions for using them. 

For a light-coloured stock use white haricot beans, 
butter beans, or peas ; for a dark one use red haricots 



92 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

or lentils. Soak the cereals for some hours, put them 
in a casserole (in the water in which they were soaked) 
along with carrots, parsnips, celery and onions, pre- 
pared and cut up into little squares, and a bouquet 
of herbs. Simmer them for many hours. Strain the 
stock into a jar, and reheat it from time to time if you 
cannot use it at once. A less cheap method is to slice 
up some celery and onions and carrots and turnips, 
and to fry them in butter with some sweet herbs. 
When they are nicely fried they must be put in a 
saucepan of cold water. After they have been brought 
to the boil they must be simmered down for an hour 
or two until one-third of the water is gone. As in the 
other process, the stock is finally strained and put 
away. 



As this, however, is a book in praise of thrift, it 
must be made plain that we do not always need such 
stocks as have been described. There is a rough-and- 
ready rule in frugal circles which declares that we 
ought not to throw away the water in which any food 
has been boiled, with the exception of water that has 
been used for boiling eggs. It goes without saying 
that the rule is not to be insisted upon when any dirt 
appears in the water, as it is apt to do sometimes — 
for example, in the cooking of certain tubers. StiU, 
speaking broadly, the advice is good. I know that 
some readers will be filled with horror at the idea of 
using the water in which cauliflowers have been boiled, 
so it will be well to give plain directions whereby this 
matter may be brought to the test. 

To-day, being a Friday, I have lunched mainly from 



SOUPS 93 

a cauliflower, served whole except for the leaves, with 
Hollandaise sauce. To-night, if I can spare the time, 
I shall take the cauliflower water as the beginning 
of a soup which, without bragging, I should not feel 
ashamed to offer to the first gourmet in England. Of 
coiu'se my cauliflower was stripped of greenery and 
was boiled without soda, but the water held plenty 
of salt. 

I shall melt in a stewpan over a very gentle heat 
about two ounces of butter and I shall add three or 
four fairly large onions cut up into rings. The lid 
will be replaced tightly and the rings of onion will 
simmer as slowly as possible for a full hour. You will 
understand that if the lid fitted too loosely the vapours 
would escape and the onions would begin to fry, which 
would spoil everything. When the hour is fully run 
out I shall add the cauliflower water, having first 
brought it exactly to the boiling point. From my 
bread-bowl I shall take what fragments I can find of 
stale bread and shall break them up small and throw 
them into the stewpan. The lid will be replaced and 
the simmering will go on for at least another hour. 
When the second hour has passed I shall examine 
a spoonful of the soup in a cup and shall make up my 
mind whether it requires any more salt, which will be 
unlikely, as the cauliflower water was salted already. 
With a wooden spoon I shall finally rub the soup 
through a sieve, thus breaking and crushing the bread 
and the onions and keeping back everything tough or 
lumpy. If the liquid which comes through the sieve 
is too thin I shall pour it back into the stewpan and 
let it go on simmering until it becomes smaller in 
quantity and therefore less watery. If, on the other 



94 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

hand, it is too thick I shall add the proper quantity 
of milk. And, when it is served, nobody who is out 
of the secret will guess that a cauliflower or an onion 
or pieces of stale bread have had anything to do 
with it. As this soup is practically the famous Soubise 
of the French cuisine, it can be made part of a formal 
menu and is by no means to be regarded as an 
amateur's cheap mess. In cold print it looks worse 
than unpromising ; but in the hot soup-plate it tastes 
almost too good to be true. Frenchwomen throw 
in bacon rinds for the last hour of simmering. 



When the Expeditionary Force returns from France, 
our soldiers will probably have made acquaintance with 
Potage Potiron, because pumpkins are in season while 
they are fighting on French soil. In the French 
quarter of London you can buy pieces of pumpkin by 
the pound, as you buy cheese. As soon as you have 
acquired a pound of pumpkin, peel it and clean it, 
and put it for a little while in boiling water. Mean- 
while you ought to have been frying in butter a leek 
and an onion cut up into small pieces. You place 
the pumpkin (which must also be cut up into small 
pieces) with the leek and onion in a saucepan, pepper 
and salt them and then drown them in warm water. 
With the lid on the pan, they must cook slowly 
throughout a long hour. Cut up three or four medium- 
sized potatoes and put them with the other vegetables 
in the pan. After thirty or forty minutes more of 
slow cooking, the soup will be ready to eat. [Some 
people fry slices of carrot with the onion and the leek, 
but I am shy of recommending this course to every- 



SOUPS 95 

one, as many housewives will not take pains to see 
that the carrots are in first-class condition. A 
poor carrot has brought many a good dish to a 
bad end.] This pumpkin soup ought to cost about 
a penny a portion, allowing nearly half-a-pint to 
each person. 



With these models in view, the intelligent cook 
will be able to make use of the vegetables in her garden 
or within reach of her purse, without the expense of 
conforming exactly to the proportions laid down in 
cookery-books. The basis of an onion [or of the white 
part of a leek] fried in butter is an immensely valu- 
able secret, and the ignorance or neglect of it largely 
accounts for the unpopularity of soups in England. 
There is a foolish idea that the onion or leek will con- 
tinue to assert itself unpleasantly. A fair trial will 
dispose of this error at once. 

In my directions for a Soubise I spoke of simmering 
my onions in butter because I was presupposing the 
need for a Friday soup. I may now explain that good 
dripping will serve the same purpose and that the 
quantity of dripping can be rather less than the 
quantity of butrer. 



Mr Peter Gallina, the brilliant young restaurateur 
who directs the " Rendezvous " in Soho, pubHshed 
a year or two ago a thin paper-covered book called 
" Eighteen Simple Menus." As a rule, I should not 
go to Mr GalHna as a teacher of economical cookery ; 
for he is shockingly open-handed with eggs and butter 



96 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

and cream. But there are two or three recipes for 
soups in his book which will not strain the resources 
of the most careful housewife, and I will transcribe 
them here. They prove once more that everyone 
who is the master of an art knows how to be simple 
when simplicity is called for. 



" Creme Parmentier. — Put a piece of butter in a 
saucepan with a tablespoonful of flour ; let it cook 
for a few minutes and moisten it with a tumbler of 
milk. Add two pints of water, two or three peeled 
potatoes, two leeks, and one onion cut into small 
pieces. Season to taste with salt and pepper, let the 
whole boil for fifteen or twenty minutes, then take 
a strainer and whisk it so that the whole goes through. 
Put in a tureen, with a piece of butter (a little cream 
can be added). Stir and serve. 

" Should the soup get too thick, add a little more 
water, or milk. This soup is sufficient for four persons. 



" Creme St Germain. — Put a piece of butter the size 
of an egg in a saucepan ; when reduced, add one onion 
and one carrot cut in small squares, also one leek 
cut small, half a bay leaf and a sprig of thyme ; cook 
for about one minute and add half-a-pound of green 
split peas, three pints of stock or water, salt, pepper 
and nutmeg ; one potato, thinly cut to bind the soup, 
can also be added. Let boil steadily for about one 
hour, then strain through a fine sieve, finally adding 
a piece of fresh butter. 



SOUPS 97 

" Creme Ambassadeur. — Proceed as for the Creme 
St Germain. Cook separately in salted water one 
handful of rice for ten or twelve minutes, and when 
the soup is strained and ready to be served add the 
rice. 



" Crfeme Sante. — Cut one onion and one leek finely, 
put in a stewpan with butter, cook them but do not 
let them brown, add six medium potatoes, cut finely, 
and three pints of water, season with salt, pepper and 
nutmeg, boil gently for half-an-hour and strain through 
a fine sieve. Have another small saucepan with a 
little butter ; when warm put a little fresh sorrel well 
washed and cut "julienne" shape, let it cook one 
minute and add to soup, finally adding a little cream, 
a piece of butter, and the yolk of an eg§ all well 
mixed together. 



" Cr^me Cressoniere. — Prepare in the same way as 
for Creme Sante, only garnish differently ; get a nice 
green bunch of watercress, pick off the leaves and 
wash stalks cleanly, add stalks to soup, cook for half- 
an-hour and strain. Boil the leaves of the water- 
cress in water for a few seconds and then add them 
to the soup. Finally add a piece of butter, a little 
cream, and the yolk of an egg. 



" Cr^me Solferino. — Put a piece of butter in a stew- 
pan, add one carrot and one onion cut into small dice, 
also one bay leaf, a sprig of thyme, and a few pepper- 

G 



98 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

corns ; cook for a minute and add a pinch of flour. 
When mixed add half-a-pint of tomato puree, also two 
pints of stock or water ; let simmer for an hour. A 
flavouring bunch consisting of one leek, one stick of 
celery, and a few sprigs of parsley should be added, 
then season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, and serve. 
A few peas can be added at the moment of serving. 
The flavouring bunch should be removed before 
sending the soup to table. 

" Creme Dubarry. — Cut one onion finely, also the 
white part of one leek, put them in a stewpan with a 
piece of butter and fry them, without letting them 
colour, for two minutes ; add two spoonfuls of flour, 
mix and let cook for a minute, add one pint of boiling 
milk and three pints of water, mix well together with 
a whisk, put on a moderate fire to boil, taking care to 
stir continually ; take a cauliflower and remove all 
leaves, cut it in pieces and add to soup ; season with 
salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg ; let boil steadily for 
twenty-five minutes, strain, and finally add a little 
cream. 

*' Potage Bonne Femme. — Cut two onions and two 
leeks finely, put them in a saucepan with a piece of 
butter, cook for a minute, add five pints of water, 
eight potatoes cut in dice, salt and pepper and a little 
nutmeg. Cook for twenty minutes, then add a hand- 
ful of vermicelli, boil for three minutes, and serve." 

All the soups just explained have familiar names 
and are cheap, tasty and wholesome. 



SOUPS 99 

Before passing on from Soup to Fish I had 
better say something about the fish stock which will 
be mentioned several times in a later chapter. A 
reason will be given against having too much fish 
stock on one's hands, but there will often be plenty 
of it in the house. Fish soups are rarely served in 
England. One excuse for their rarity may be found 
in the foolishness of certain enthusiasts who have 
tried to make and sell the famous bouillabaisse while 
lacking the Mediterranean fishes without which it is 
bound to disappoint the eater. I shall therefore 
write only a few lines about fish soup, and shall 
describe the simplest of them all. 

Your fish stock being well strained, put a quart of 
it in a clean stewpan. Mix a tablespoonful of corn- 
flour carefully in half-a-pint of milk, taking care that 
there are no lumps. Add the milk and cornflour to 
the stock and bring the contents of the pan to the 
boiling-point, stirring all the time. You will season 
the mixture with pepper and salt according to the 
saltiness or otherwise of the stock. After the boiling- 
point is attained, simmer the soup for a few minutes, 
as it is necessary in this and every other dish to be- 
ware of eating such stuff as cornflour until it is pro- 
perly cooked. Now take a bowl or a soup tureen and 
put at the bottom of it an egg well beaten up. Pour 
the soup in very slowly, never ceasing to stir and stir 
and stir. 

As the fish stock costs you nothing and the corn- 
flour is an almost negligible expense, you will get this 
soup for practically the price of one egg and a tumbler- 
ful of milk. In order that those who eat it may 
treat it as a food and not swallow it as a liquid (which 



100 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

is dangerous where cornflour and all other starch is 
concerned) little pieces of toast should be thrown in 
at the last moment. At my own modest table I do 
not use toast ; but as my little innovations would 
take too long to explain, the reader must be left to 
work out his own ideas, always remembering to make 
use of what might otherwise be wasted. 



CHAPTER VI 

SAUCES 

Everybody has heard of Voltaire's gibe that England 
is the country of a hundred religions and only one 
sauce. But everybody has not tried to analyse the 
causes of our national shortcomings so far as sauces 
are concerned. As I point out in other chapters, 
the English prefer to confine themselves to the best 
materials, and it follows that they do not care to veil 
the perfections of their sirloins and saddles under 
trimmings. There is, however, another reason. 
During the years when the great sauces were being 
brought to perfection in France, the English were 
entering upon an epoch of neo-Puritanism. I am 
speaking of the eighteenth century and of the Evan- 
gelical Revival. The Evangelicals certainly did not 
mortify themselves after the fashion of the mediaeval 
saints. Indeed, they ate and drank amply and 
choicely. It is beyond dispute, however, that they 
disliked a show of extravagance and luxury, and 
therefore they fell out of the running so far as the 
higher cookery is concerned. And their error per- 
sists up to this day. When an enthusiast for good 
cookery describes some happy discovery in a mixed 
company, he usually finds at least one of his hearers 
looking at him with a pained smile of polite reproach, 
as if to say : " Thank God we don't all worship our 
luncheon and dinner like this."

102 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

It is quite commonly believed that wide ranges of 
sauces are demanded by the glutton alone. Now, 
so far as my own experience goes, sauces have an 
entirely different function and effect. The men and 
women in England who eat too much and acquire 
gout or indigestion or liver complaints are not the 
lovers of a varied and skilfully-sauced diet. They 
are the people who eat their way through the fifty- 
two weeks of the year on a narrow programme of 
bacon and eggs, hot joints, occasional game, about 
a dozen different vegetables at the most in twelve 
months, few salads, and large quantities of pastries 
and sweets. In fifty years a man of this type probably 
eats at least a ton more food than is consumed in the 
same period by a reasonable gourmet. He derives 
less energy and pleasure from his meals ; and his food 
costs him more. 



I will grant, in fairness, that there are many sauces 
which every right-minded man must pronounce sin- 
ful luxuries. A sauce which requires a whole day's 
labour to prepare about a pint, and costs as much as 
would keep a labourer's family for a month, ought to 
stick in one's throat [except when it is made to main- 
tain culinary standards at their highest and as an 
exercise in the utmost professional skill]. These 
wildly extravagant sauces, however, are more talked 
about than made. Most of the restaurants where they 
flourished have shut their doors, and there are few 
people left, outside the new-rich of the United States, 
to support the chefs in these pretensions. 

In old cookery-books one sometimes found recipes 



SAUCES 103 

for sauces which caused the earnest reader to lift up 
his hands in horror. For example, I have come 
across one which required six bottles of good wine, 
twelve pounds of prime beef, four capons and ten 
game birds for the extraction of just enough sauce to 
fill an ordinary sauce-boat. But it is probable that 
such directions as these were never once carried out. 
They were intended to hoodwink the public. We 
know that the sauce-makers in old Paris were banded 
together in a guild and that they guarded their 
mystery with the most jealous care. Sauce Espagnole 
was a dead secret. Chefs refused to prepare it until 
the other servants had gone to bed ; and, when they 
were pressed for the recipe by personages who could 
hardly be refused, they seem to have invented 
monstrous prescriptions which both discouraged the 
inquirer and helped to justify the cook's lavish 
expenditure in his pantry and kitchen. It is to be 
understood, therefore, that we have to do in this 
chapter with the use of sauces, not their abuse ; and 
that we can put all freak sauces on one side. 



The true use of sauce is soundly stated by Dr 
Thudichum, who says : " Solid varieties of food, 
soluble only by digestion, are not rarely dry in sub- 
stance, or unattractive in taste, or insufficiently or 
too strongly flavoured. To make such dry food 
moister, to lubricate it, and thus aid in its use, to 
increase the attractiveness of the taste by additions 
of flavours and juxtaposition of contrast, to hide or 
mask excessive flavours, certain liquid additions 
have been invented which pass by the name of 



104 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

sauces" ["The Spirit of Cookery," p. 223. London, 

1895]. 



The best sauce is well known to be Hunger. Those 
German stragglers who were captured after the battle 
of the Mame with nothing but raw beets and raw 
oats in their poor stomachs had got down the stuff 
with the help of this sauce ; and, if they had not 
bolted the beets but had masticated them well, they 
might have eaten worse food. Next to Hunger comes 
Salt. Of course, most of us would call salt a condi- 
ment, not a sauce. It is instructive, however, to 
note that the word sauce has been worn down from 
the word salsa. Even the least learned, by grouping 
together the words " salt," " salsa " and " salivation," 
will perceive the ancient origins of the true philosophy 
of sauce. 



All this may seem a lengthy preamble. But it is 
of the utmost importance that the cook who wants 
to get out of narrow ways, and to keep house on 
cheaper and pleasanter and healthier lines, should 
disabuse her mind entirely of the belief that sauces 
are merely luxuries. Having grasped their true place 
in kitchen economy, she will find a vast field of possi- 
bihties opened to her. The cheaper kinds of fish and 
the second and third cuts of meat can be brought up 
to the level of the best fish and the prime cuts as soon 
as the cook is willing to spend on ingredients for sauce 
a part (not all) of the money she has saved at the 
fishmonger's and the butcher's. 



SAUCES 105 

To some extent, sauces are already recognised, even 
in the most humdrum and monotonous kitchens. 
The cook who simply stews down a large cooking 
apple to take away the richness of a goose or a duck 
or a piece of fresh pork, is using sauce in one of its 
most necessary applications. Our plain cooks have 
also some dim perception of what is called Melted 
Butter. This is the sauce that Voltaire jeered at, 
and the name is certainly most unfortunate. Every 
writer on cookery hates it. Over and over again in 
jotting down recipes, where one would naturally 
write of a little melted butter in a stewpan (meaning 
some butter newly melted and nothing else), one has 
to guard against some reader thinking of the so- 
called melted butter which is used as a sauce. And, 
too often, this sauce is even more hateful than its 
name. Cooks think that it is easy to make ; yet 
the truth is that the preparation of this sort of sauce, 
or of its sisters Sauce Blanche and Sauce Blonde is 
considered a test of skill among those who know what 
they are talking about. Mustard Sauce and Caper 
Sauce and Parsley Sauce are frequently found to be 
no more than melted butter sauce mixed with mustard 
or capers or chopped parsley. 

Bread Sauce is often good in England and is used 
intelligently in relation to game. Mint Sauce is gener- 
ally well made, and this also is used in the right way. 
But there are not many other sauces which can be 
safely asked for in ordinary homes. The Hollandaise, 
in two cases out of three, is a debacle of good eggs and 
good butter, and it often reminds me of a friend, both 
a cook and a scholar, who, when trying to consume 
with me an infamous Hollandaise which had cost a 



io6 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

shilling for a very smaU boatful, moaned : " Some- 
thing is here for tears." 



We must, none the less, be reasonable and not 
attempt to imitate in small kitchens the achievements 
of the sauce-cooks in great houses and in first-class 
restaurants. Many a housewife has been discouraged 
in her attempts to turn over a new leaf by being told 
that serious cookery is impossible unless one main- 
tains constant supplies of the famous " mother sauces." 
Writers on cookery tell us that there are two great 
foundation sauces, "the Adam and Eve of cookery, 
whence most others have sprung." These sauces are 
Espagnole, which is a brown sauce, and Veloutee, 
which is white ; and nearly all other sauces are sup- 
posed to be formed by additions to these two. Other 
writers speak of three foundations, or even five. I 
do not propose to reproduce the well-worn arguments. 
Nor will it be possible to give in detail instructions for 
making the grand sauces, either mothers or daughters. 
That they are beyond the reach of ordinary house- 
keepers became plain to me one night when I was 
watching the preparation of my own little dinner in 
the kitchen of a restaurant where the proprietors were 
well known to me. Rightly or wrongly, the chef had 
been dismissed an hour before. The kitchen staff was 
cosmopolitan, and, as it was a time of International 
crisis, there was a good deal of strong feeling all round. 
I noticed that the manager was anxious and that he 
was spending more time in the kitchen than was 
usual. It turned out that he had fears for his 
"foundations," which he valued at nearly £50; 



SAUCES 107 

because, some years before, a sudden change of staff 
had been attended by an " accident " to these 
mother sauces. 

The great foundations are entitled to the utmost 
honour ; and, when one goes to a good restaurant, 
it is generally a pity to ask for plain dishes instead of 
fish and entrees with which the famous sauces are 
served. Let home be home ; and let the professional 
restaurateur show us that he is a professional who 
knows his work. 



Now for some sauces. We will begin with a simple 
version of White Sauce. I shall take it for granted 
that you have a good, small, enamelled saucepan, 
with the enamel entirely unbroken, and that you 
possess a wooden spoon which is not too clumsy. 
Melt rather less than an ounce of butter in the pan 
and cook therein some flour, weighing a trifle less than 
the butter. It goes without saying that, as you are 
aiming at a white sauce, you will not let the mixture 
become brown. When the flour and butter are 
cooked, draw the saucepan to the side of the stove 
and add two gills of good white stock made from the 
remains of a chicken or from some veal. Stir it up 
well and replace it over the fire, continuing to stir 
until it boils. After the boiling-point is reached, go 
on cooking the mixture slowly for nearly a quarter of 
an hour. Then season it with pepper and salt (varied 
according to the saltiness of the stock) and with a 
little lemon juice. Strain the sauce through a hair 
sieve, or through a pointed strainer. I take it for 
granted that you possess a perforated spoon and that 



io8 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

you will always skim sauces and all other preparations 
on which a scum rises. If you wish the sauce to be 
beautifully smooth, you wiU wring it through a 
cloth instead of sieving it. You are to understand 
that this is not a complete sauce, but a very simple 
foundation. 



I am tempted to give you directions for a much more 
satisfactory white foundation — a true Velout^e — but 
this is a handbook of economical cookery. So we 
will go on to a simple Sauce Espagnole, or smooth 
brown sauce. You will make it on a day when you 
have some trimmings of ham or veal in the house, or 
some good scraps of birds or ground game. Cut up 
three sound carrots, as well as an onion and a clove. 
Butter the bottom of a saucepan with about an ounce 
of butter and add your scraps of game and meat 
with the vegetables. Put the lid on the pan and 
cook the contents on a slow fire. When they have 
turned a light brown, stir in a tablespoonful of flour 
and just enough hot stock to moisten the mixture 
well. As I do not know how much game and meat 
you will be using, I cannot define the quantity of 
stock exactly, but it must be enough to make the 
stirring of the mixture quite easy. You must stir 
all the time you are pouring in the stock. Introduce 
a bouquet as described on page 145. Replace the 
lid once more, and simmer the sauce as gently as 
possible for about four hours. Finally, skim it and 
sieve it. Pour it into a jar and let it get cold. 
Then cover the jar, and the sauce will keep for some 
time. 



SAUCES 109 

A Sauce Bechamel is considered a mother sauce by 
many authorities, and, as I prescribe it in the chapter 
on vegetables for a Choufleur au gratin, I will give 
simple directions for making it. Begin as before by 
melting an ounce of butter in the pan and cooking in 
it a dessertspoonful of flour without letting it begin 
to turn brown. Add salt, mace and pepper — white 
pepper, because this is to be a whitish sauce. Add 
two gills of hot milk, stirring it all the time as you 
pour it in, and then a little finely minced parsley. Go 
on stirring until the mixture boils. After the boiling- 
point is reached, the further boiling must proceed 
very gently indeed and for not more than two or three 
minutes. You can improve this sauce very much by 
putting in some cream as well as hot milk. The sauce 
requires straining. [This is a poor man's Bechamel 
without mushrooms. Use very little mace.] 



A Sauce Hollandaise is considered rather luxurious, 
but it will often be found cheap in the end, as it 
carries off inexpensive materials in the grand style. 
To make it you will require the yolks of three eggs. 
You will put them in a saucepan with two ounces of 
butter, a dessertspoonful of flour, a dusting of nut- 
meg and a little salt. Mix all these well together. 
Add a gill of cold water. Bring them almost to 
the boiling-point — not quite — stirring all the time. 
It is of great importance not to bring the mixture to 
full boihng. As soon as boiling is imminent, draw 
the saucepan away from the fire and stir in another 
ounce of butter. You must stir on until the sauce 
is beautifully smooth. Finally, add the juice of a 



110 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

good lemon and serve the Sauce Hollandaise as hot 
as possible. 

A more distinguished Sauce Hollandaise may some- 
times be required. If you are a beginner in cookery 
you had better take two saucepans. Pour some hot 
water into the larger pan and place the smaller pan 
therein. Assemble your ingredients. You require two 
bare tablespoonfuls of vinegar, the well-beaten yolks 
of three eggs, some salt, some pepper, and rather less 
than a quarter of a pound of butter. First put the 
vinegar in the inner pan and reduce it to about half 
its bulk. Take the pan off the fire and let the vinegar 
cool for two minutes, then mix into it the beaten yolks 
of eggs, salted and peppered. Put it back over a 
moderate heat and cook it for two minutes, never 
ceasing to stir it. Little by little, introduce an ounce 
and a half of butter, which you ought to have weighed 
beforehand. You may take the pan off the fire to put 
in this butter. Return it to the fire, still stirring it. 
As soon as you perceive that the butter is thoroughly 
incorporated with the other ingredients, again lift 
the pan from the fire and work in, with ceaseless 
stirring, another two ounces of butter. Put it back 
over the fire and cook jt very gently for another ten 
minutes, when it will be found smooth and creamy. 
In this recipe, whenever I speak of putting the pan 
back over the fire, I mean (if you are using two pans) 
the inner pan only, and I take it for granted that the 
water in the outer pan will be boiling, though not 
boiling fiercely. It is better to learn to dispense with 
the outer pan for the earlier stages of the operation, 
but the last ten minutes of cooking are always safer 
with the outer pan of boiling water. If you are 



SAUCES III 

determined to follow the examples of many cooks and 
to turn out a disgraceful Hollandaise, let the sauce 
boil. 



Sauce Mornay enables a cook to make use of cheap 
white fish, or even remains of fish from an earlier 
meal, without appearing to be parsimonious. Heat 
thoroughly in a small saucepan two gills of good white 
sauce. Without letting it come to the boil, work in 
gradually two tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan 
cheese and an ounce of butter, not in one lump but^ 
little bit by little bit. Cream will do instead of butter, 
the quantity of cream to be the same as the quantity 
of grated cheese. The sauce must not boil, but it 
must be very hot. 



For a Sauce Soubise, one wants two gills of the 
simpler Bechamel Sauce, with some cream and three or 
four onions. The onions are cooked in salted water, 
boiling briskly, until they are quite tender. This may 
mean a full hour. When the onions are cooked 
through, they are to be thoroughly drained, chopped 
up small, and put through a hair sieve. The puree 
which comes through the sieve is mixed in a saucepan 
with the Bechamel Sauce and is brought to the boil. 
It is then seasoned with salt and white pepper ; and 
some people dust in a few grains of cayenne and a 
thimbleful of powdered sugar. The cream, if you can 
spare any, is added last of all. This is a very useful 
sauce for entrees. For example, it enables a house- 
keeper of modest resources to serve Cotelettes ^ la 



112 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

Soubise, which many professional cooks wrongly 
describe as Cotelettes a la Maintenon. 



As we are not pretending to practise la haute 
cuisine, I shall not attempt an orderly exposition of 
the famous sauces which are built up from the great 
foundations. The directions just given can be applied 
by anybody with ordinary intelligence to the con- 
ventional recipes in the regular cookery-books, so as 
to simplify and cheapen them where necessary. The 
ordinary books will tell you all about Egg Sauce, 
Mushroom Sauce, Onion Sauce, Parsley Sauce, 
Shrimp Sauce, Tomato Sauce, Sauce Mousseline, 
Sauce Normande, Sauce Poivrade, Sauce Ravigote, 
Sauce Supreme, Sauce Venitienne, Sauce Remoulade, 
Sauce Tartare, and the various sweet sauces for use 
with puddings. I shall therefore close this chapter 
with one or two prescriptions which, though they may 
be found in other books, are so useful in good and 
economical cookery that it will do no harm to give 
them prominence. 



No man or woman will make progress in cookery 
while cherishing the idea that it is arbitrar}^ The 
best recipes are the best recipes, simply because 
experience proves that there are no better ways of 
reaching the desired results. While I was first 
fumbling and blundering in cookery, I found myself 
one day groping after the right sauce to serve with the 
remains of a goose. With the materials which were 
at hand, I produced a sauce which served its purpose 



SAUCES 113 

quite well, and I thought I had made a discovery until 
an accomplished cook burst out laughing and told me 
that my supposed novelty was practically the same 
as a Sauce Robert. To make this sauce, chop up two 
or three big EngHsh or French onions and cook them 
with two ounces of butter, in a closed pan, for about a 
quarter of an hour. Take the lid off the pan, throw 
in a little flour, and continue the cooking, stirring 
with a wooden spoon, until the contents of the pan go 
down to a brown pulp. Pour in about a gill of good 
stock, previously heated, and season the mixture with 
a teaspoonful of made mustard, a teaspoonful of wine 
vinegar and some salt and pepper. Reduce the sauce 
by further boiling without ceasing to stir it. 



Many a commonplace entree may be redeemed by 
a dish of potatoes with Sauce Maitre d'Hotel. Melt 
an ounce of butter in a pan and add to it almost its 
own bulk of chopped parsley, with a dessertspoonful 
of lemon juice, a taste of nutmeg, some salt and some 
white pepper. The lemon juice must not be thrown 
in all at once but must be mixed gradually with the 
butter and the parsley. Add some cooked potatoes 
cut in very thin slices, put on the lid of the pan, and 
shake the slices of potato in the sauce till they are 
warmed through and well mixed with the other in- 
gredients. It is obvious that the potatoes should be of 
the firm or waxy kind. A good tablespoonful of 
cream or white stock, put in at the same time as the 
slices of potato, will be a great improvement. 

I have given the formula for this sauce as part of a 
recipe for potatoes, but it can be applied to pieces of 

H 



114 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

fish or game or meat, as well as to potatoes, with good 
results. 



Mayonnaise is not so very expensive, and it 
recoups its cost in many ways. Here are directions 
for making a small quantity. Put into a basin the 
yolk of an eg§. In hot weather you may require two 
yolks, unless you are able to stand the basin on a block 
of ice. Add at least a dessertspoonful of vinegar. It 
is best to mix equal quantities of Tarragon vinegar 
and French white-wine vinegar. Mix the yolk of egg, 
the vinegar and a teaspoonful of dry mustard and 
salt and pepper well together in the basin. Some 
people sprinkle in a few grains of sugar. The mixing 
must be very thoroughly done with an egg-whisk or a 
wooden spoon. Next add, drop by drop, half-a-giU 
of good oHve oil. I repeat, drop by drop. 

The working in of olive oil, drop by drop, is trouble- 
some to the mayonnaise-maker, and certain ingenious 
persons have tried to ease his burden. A few years 
ago I bought in a French town a contrivance for 
regulating the flow of the oil, but I wish I had spent 
my francs and centimes on a good old French dinner. 
The best trick I know for adding the oil is to cut a 
hole in the cork of the oil bottle. While the drops of 
oil are falHng, the stirring must never stop until the 
sauce becomes very thick and smooth. You will 
taste the sauce now and again, and you may find that 
it requires a few more drops of vinegar, which must 
be stirred in as diUgently as the drops of oil. 

The making of mayonnaise is a dehcate operation, 
contingent upon the temperature, upon the day's 



SAUCES 115 

humidity, and also upon the nature of the materials. 
Sometimes you will fail to obtain a thick mayonnaise 
on the lines just laid down. Should this misfortune 
befall, melt a little butter, let it cool again, and work 
it into the sauce. In this way you will obtain a 
mayonnaise good enough to use, although it will be 
below the professional level. 



The useful Sauce Italienne requires two gills of brown 
sauce as a foundation. One begins by chopping up 
two shalots and putting them into a pan with about 
a tablespoonful of olive oil. They must be cooked 
but not browned. Next, one must add half- a- gill of 
Marsala, the two gills of brown sauce, a dessertspoon- 
ful of chopped parsley, a tablespoonful of chopped 
mushrooms, a bay leaf and a sprig of thyme. This 
mixture must be simmered very slowly for a quarter 
of an hour. Should scum rise to the surface, of course 
it must be skimmed away. Some people mix finely 
chopped ham with the parsley and mushrooms, in 
which case the skimming will become still more 
necessary. Before the sauce is served, the thyme 
and the bay-leaf must be withdrawn. 

Sauce Italienne is poured over Macaroni after it 
has been boiled tender and well drained ; over 
braised liver or sUces of braised meat, and over many 
other dishes which would otherwise be unattractive. 



There is no room for more sauce recipes. But a few 
lines must be spared for some parting advice. Al- 
though sauces have been studied for thousands of 



ii6 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

years, it was not until the seventeenth century that 
cooks began to prepare the great sauces as we now 
understand them. And, just as those cooks improved 
upon their predecessors, the cooks of to-day ought not 
to stand still. Our ideas of a good dinner are not the 
ideas which prevailed in the reign of le Grand 
Monarque, and our sauces should not be the same as 
those which were prepared by Vatel. We command 
a greater variety of materials than Vatel ever knew, 
while our notions are less vulgar. A school of 
brilliant but simple sauce-making will arise if this 
generation will apply itself to the problem. We 
ought to be neither irreverent nor servile towards the 
past ; and we ought to be neither complicated nor 
indolent in our new departures. " The destiny of 
nations," said Brillat Savarin, " depends on the 
manner in which they take their food " ; and, as the 
basic processes of cookery are everlasting, it is in 
sauces and in garnishes that reform and progress 
must be achieved. I saw an old sauce-boat the other 
day in the shape of an unrigged galleon ; and, as I 
looked, I thought that sauce-boats were barques to 
carry mankind on and on. 



CHAPTER VII 

FISH 

I BEGIN this chapter on Fish on the morrow of the 
Admiralty's announcement that our Grand Fleet has 
swept the whole of the North Sea without meeting a 
single German ship. While it may be too much to 
hope that the enemy will be completely thwarted in 
further mine-laying and that their submarines will 
never be heard of again, it is safe to assume that fish 
wiU still be caught in British nets and brought to 
British markets. Indeed, there are well-informed 
people who believe that fish will be landed more 
plentifully and sold more cheaply than ever. 

A great quantity of fish is eaten in England ; but it 
is amazing that the total is not twice as great. Fish 
is the only important food that can be had for the 
mere taking. If the present expanse of the North 
Sea were suddenly upheaved and became dry land 
covered with pastures and orchards in which one could 
find corn without having to plough and sow, and fruit 
without having to plant and prune, and sheep and 
oxen without having to breed and rear, there would 
be great public satisfaction. But we are not much 
impressed by the familiar knowledge that millions of 
tons of fish are waiting to be caught, in fine and plump 
condition, without our having had to spend a farthing 
in hatching and feeding them. Bacon, which is not 
a fresh meat and is expensive to produce, seems to be 
117 



ii8 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

regarded in almost innumerable English homes as a 
daily necessity. If fish were in equal demand, the 
merchants, who have been criticised, not quite justly, 
could arrange to give it to us in larger quantities, in 
better condition, and at lower prices. I do not say 
that the fish supply could be organised as closely as the 
milk supply and the bread supply; because storms 
and fogs and the vagaries of the fish themselves are 
disturbing factors ; but I do say that, if we were 
steadfast in calling for cheaper fish and more of it, 
we should certainly get it. 



Some years ago I tried to find out by direct obser- 
vation and inquiry the truth about our Enghsh 
attitude towards a fish diet. I gathered that the 
finer fishes are highly prized, and that they are gener- 
ally well cooked, in the best houses and clubs and 
restaurants. At the other end of the scale, I found 
among the lower classes an apparent enthusiasm for 
fish which did not, however, stand closer investigation. 
Our poorer quarters abound in establishments called 
fried-fish shops which do a roaring trade ; and it is 
not uncommon to see young beauties, who, in the 
uncertain gaslight, seem fashionably dressed, walking 
along London's eastern highways consuming dark 
brown slabs of fish and wedges of fried potatoes to 
match, these delicacies being wrapped in a back 
number of a newspaper whose contents are read 
under obvious difficulties. It appears, however, 
from the testimony of those who are in the confidence 
of these lovely creatures, that the fish is much less 
liked than the " fry." Indeed it may be said that 



FISH 119 

fried fish of this kind is more of an animal than of a 
fish diet, the frying vehicle being rarely oil and nearly 
always animal fat. Among those of the same class 
who have homes and kitchens of their own, the 
popular fish are kippers and bloaters, which give 
satisfaction largely because of the slight scorching of 
the surface by which they are cooked. The smoked 
fish which used to be best prepared at Findhorn, and 
is now known to the Cockney housewife as a " finny 
haddie," is also relished largely because of the taste 
of the smoke and the fire. Omitting working-class 
households where the wife, before marriage, was in 
domestic service, I have rarely found in this social 
grade the habit of eating fish for fish's sake. Where 
even the simplest sauces are unattempted, because they 
are thought to be too much trouble, a delicate fish 
has no chance against two pork sausages or a slice of 
meat almost blackened in a frying-pan with rings of 
raw onion. Among the middle classes, fish is patron- 
ised fitfully. Owing to the horror of washing-up, 
which I have already mentioned, an English house- 
keeper prefers to give two helpings from one dish 
rather than one helping from each of two. If she is 
intending to spend three shillings on the principal 
materials for a dinner, she would rather lay out half -a- 
crown on meat than spend one-and-sixpence at the 
butcher's and eightpence or ninepence at the fish- 
monger's. And even in fairly well - maintained 
middle-class kitchens there is an unwillingness to take 
trouble with the sauces and garnishes so essential to 
good fish cookery. 

It must be admitted, however, that some men are 
grossly unfair in their expectations. I have heard a 



120 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

husband, after being chided for objecting to fish at 
home, make the lofty retort that he would consent to 
eat his wife's fish dishes if she would bring them up to 
the standard of his favourite restaurant. In many 
departments of cookery, even a modest private 
kitchen can beat the utmost efforts of a hotel kitchen, 
where too many vapours accumulate and combine. 
The great fish dishes, however, would be so wasteful 
if made privately in small quantities that I should 
hesitate to press them on simple cooks at any time, 
while in war-time they are unthinkable. At a 
restaurant, for example, when the bill of fare gives 
prominence to a sole in a sauce of white wine with tips 
of asparagus, there is no waste. The whole tin of 
asparagus tips is used and the whole bottle of cheap 
white wine follows it. In a private house there may 
be very good reasons why neither the asparagus nor 
the wine can be all used while they are still fresh. 
White wine does not suit everybody ; and a dinner 
with asparagus in it twice over would be an offence 
against good design. Let nobody therefore insist on 
the restaurant standard. On the other hand, let no 
housewife imagine that she has done the whole duty 
of woman towards fish by simply ringing the changes 
on fillets fried in breadcrumb, middle cuts boiled, 
and lobster mayonnaise. With the exception of 
such fish as salmon and mackerel, many items of fish 
diet are deficient in natural fat, and sauce is therefore 
demanded to make good the defect as well as to 
please the palate. 



Hints have already been thrown out here and there 



FISH 121 

in this book that steaming is better than boihng for 
many kinds of fish. It is fair to say, however, that 
some thoroughly accomplished cooks prefer boiling. 
They argue that fishes, although they live in weak 
brine, often need salt. This is true. Indeed it will 
help us to cook them more successfully if we will get 
it into our minds that fishes, after all, are not so 
vastly unlike the land animals which we cook and eat. 
Many people still have an idea that a fish must be 
watery, forgetting that he breathes air as we do. 
A fish contains almost as high a percentage of solids 
as an ox, and he no more tastes of sea-salt than a calf 
tastes of cowslips. The process of boiling admits 
of the convenient salting of fish, while steaming 
presents a difficulty in this respect. Assuming, as I 
do throughout this book, that only small quantities 
of food have to be cooked at one and the same time, I 
recommend a simple process. Butter a plate. Lay 
your cleaned and trimmed fish in the middle of it. 
Salt and otherwise season the fish to your taste. 
Squeeze a few drops of lemon juice over it, if you wish 
to do so. Butter or grease a sheet of clean white 
paper. Place this on top of the fish and keep it in 
position by putting the saucepan lid over everything. 
Having meanwhile brought some water to the boil in 
the saucepan, place the plate with its contents on top 
of the saucepan and let the boiling continue for a 
little more or less than half-an-hour, according to the 
kind and size of fish. This is not exactly what is 
meant by steaming, although it is certainly cooking 
by steam without letting the water touch the fish. 
Out-and-out steaming is effected m an open-work 
steamer through which the steam plays freely. 



122 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

In Holland, fish is boiled in sea-water. This is an 
experiment I should like to make if I lived on a rocky 
island in the midst of an absolutely unpolluted sea, 
but I have never screwed up my courage to use such 
sea- water as has been available. 



If you are determined to boil your fish, put about 
an ounce of salt to each quart of water — less rather 
than more. A teaspoonful of vinegar or lemon 
juice may also be added to each quart of water, to 
keep the flesh firm and of good colour. After you 
have boiled your fish, you will have a chance of per- 
ceiving why I look upon boiling as wasteful. Set 
the liquor on one side and you will often find that it 
will cool into a jelly, owing to the large amount of 
natural gelatine which has been boiled out of the 
fish. You cannot devise uses for large supplies of 
fish stock, and it is therefore better, on the whole, to 
steam the fish, thus retaining all its goodness. 

Ten days ago I came across a bad instance of waste- 
fulness in the cooking of fish. Some charitable people 
were engaged in feeding a large number of the poor 
and destitute. They had more than a dozen fine 
cod-fish for the purpose, and their first action after 
cleaning the fish was to cut off the twelve heads and 
throw them into the dustbin. A wise cook, even if 
he had been cooking for rich people, would have re- 
tained the heads (of course, taking out the eyes) and 
would have secured a much better result. When the 
dozen of fish had been boiled, the water was poured 
down a drain, although it was so gelatinous that you 
could have stood a wooden spoon in it when it was 



FISH 123 

cold. All this took place during the first month 
of the War, when the Germans were still having it 
nearly all their own way in France and the outlook 
was sombre. 



To those who still have open fires, I can suggest 
nothing better than the cooking of fish in an old- 
fashioned Dutch oven. The fish must be hghtly 
buttered all over before it is set before the fire. 
Housekeepers who have nothing but a gas-stove, or 
closed range, can do wonders by baking fish in a 
moderate oven. I find a fireproof dish best and I use 
the same dish, which has a pleasant old-fashioned 
look, at the table without risking the breaking up 
of the fish by transferring it to another vessel. Of 
course, the dish must be well buttered before the fish 
is laid in it and it should be covered with buttered 
paper. If you like, 3/ou can poach your fish, especi- 
ally fillets, in a clean baking-tin well buttered. You 
will pour in just enough fish stock to cover them. 
You can add a little white wine to the stock, and 
make experiments with other flavourings. Like 
baked fish, a poached fish is covered over with buttered 
paper. Sometimes you will not wish to heat the 
oven just for one or two fillets, and in this case you 
can poach them in a shallow saucepan at the top of 
the stove. They do not require more than a few 
minutes to cook. When you have lifted them out 
and drained them well, you should be ready to use 
some of the hot stock as part of a sauce to serve with 
them. Learn to reduce fish liquor for sauce. As for 
stewing, frying, grilling and other ways of cooking 



124 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

fish, you will find out the best ways from your regular 
cookery-book, or you will infer them from what is 
said in other chapters of this manual. 



I have referred to the cheapness of herrings. It 
will pay you well, if you have not the time or skill 
yourself, to talk the cleaning and filleting over with 
your fishmonger so that this may be properly done. 
Herrings are so low priced that it would not be 
reasonable to expect the fishmonger, at the busiest 
time of the day, to occupy himself with your require- 
ments unless you are a fairly regular customer for 
other kinds of fish on which he can recoup himself. 
I say this because some housewives will never learn 
to prepare herrings themselves, and, as they are sensi- 
tive about giving trouble to shop people, they prac- 
tically drop this fish out of their scheme of life. 

If it were a question of the skate or the eel, I could 
understand a certain squeamishness. Those fish 
have not the beauty of Venus rising from the sea. 
Speaking for myself, I have never quite conquered 
my horror of the eel, although he is so cooked by the 
villagers on the banks of the Lower Seine as to make 
one of the most delicate dishes I have ever eaten. 
And the skate is an ugly brute. But the herring is 
a sweet creature to handle. When he is fresh, his 
silver armour is like Lohengrin's in the opera. There 
is nothing loathsome about him, inside or out. I 
shaU therefore apologise for him no more but shall 
take it for granted that my readers will use him freely 
in war-time, and try to learn to clean him themselves. 
Now for ways of cooking him. 



FISH 125 

Having stripped two long fillets from a fresh her- 
ring, wipe them with a cloth. Salt them and pepper 
them, and squeeze over them a little lemon juice. 
Put them in a cold place until the next day. When 
you want to eat them, coat them with egg and bread- 
crumbs and fry them in a deep bath of boiling oil 
or fat according to the general rule about frying 
already laid down. Drain the grease from them, 
and serve them very hot with some chopped parsley 
and some more lemon juice. 



On some other occasion, cut off the heads and tails 
and fins of some herrings, split the fish open and take 
out as many bones as you can, big and little. Close 
the fishes again, as you would close a book, and 
sprinkle over them lemon juice and salt and pepper. 
Lemon juice is mentioned in this herring cookery 
because the herring is an oily fish and its oiliness 
needs correcting. After they have lain for about an 
hour, dip them in oatmeal until they are thickly 
mealed on both sides. Take your largest frying-pan 
and melt in it an ounce or two of the best dripping. 
As the dripping begins to smoke, transfer the herrings 
to it, opened, with the flesh downwards and the oat- 
meal upwards. As soon as the lower side is browned, 
turn the herrings over and brown them on the mealed 
side . Drain them thoroughly and serve them very hot . 
This is the best way of frying herrings ; but if you prefer 
a simpler way you need not split them open. You can 
merely trim and wash and clean them, scrape and score 
the skin with a knife, dip them into flour which has 
been touched up with pepper and salt, and fry them. 



126 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

A grilled or broiled herring is even better than the 
same fish fried. To prepare it, you cut off the head 
and fins and you scrape off the scales ; but you do 
not split the fish open. You score it, smear it over 
with a little oil or butter, and pepper and salt it. 
Then you cook the fish for eight or nine minutes under 
the deflecting griller of a gas-stove or before a hot, 
bright fire, if you have no gridiron. Mustard sauce 
and a plain boiled potato go well with a grilled herring. 

In frying or grilling herrings, it is always necessary 
to score diagonal lines in the skin, so that the fish 
shall not shrink and curl. 



For herrings to be eaten cold, wash, clean and trim 
the fish and scrape the skins. Take off, from each 
herring, two long fillets. Dip these fillets in flour, 
peppered and salted. Butter a fireproof dish. Roll 
up each fillet of herring, beginning with the thick end 
and working to the stump of the tail. Put these rolls 
rather closely in the fireproof dish and half fill it with 
a mixture of water and brown vinegar. Add a little 
of whatever you may possess in the way of pepper- 
corns and mace. Put little bits of butter here and 
there on the fish, and bake the whole thing for an hour 
in a moderate oven. Serve the dish as soon as it is 
cold. 



Steamed cod is looked upon as very plain feeding, 
but it can be made highly attractive by a cook who 
will vary the sauces from time to time. A good way 
of using this fish is to bake it in slices. Butter a 



FISH 127 

baking-tin and scatter tiny choppings of raw^.onion 
all over the bottom. Lay a slice of cod on this founda- 
tion. Pour over the fish a yolk of egg, beaten up 
with pepper and salt and some lemon juice. The 
quantity of lemon juice will be according to taste, 
but it should not be stinted. Dab tiny pieces of 
butter over the egg and lemon juice. Bake the fish 
until the top takes a pleasant golden hue. A moment 
or two before serving, transfer the fish to the dish 
on which it will be sent to table — taking care that the 
dish is very hot — and pour a gill of brown sauce into 
the tin. Stir the brown sauce for a moment or two, 
so as to mix it well with all that is left in the tin ; 
bring it to the boiling-point ; and then pour it over 
the slice of fish. These instructions can be applied 
to hake, halibut, and to small thick steaks or cutlets 
of rock salmon. 



Some people have a strong objection to plaice, and 
I should certainly agree with them if I were doomed 
to eat nothing but a daily ration of this fish, plain 
boiled. It is, however, so much cheaper than soles 
that we ought to try to make the best of it. Here is 
a method which is certainly not the worst. Buy a 
good thick plaice with plenty of flesh on its bones. 
Clean it. Remove the dark skin if you can : if you 
can't, the fishmonger will do it for you. Butter a 
fireproof dish, and sprinkle plenty of fine breadcrumbs 
and some parsley, chopped very small, all over the 
butter, with some pepper and salt and a chopped 
mushroom. I will say, in passing, that if you are 
buying regularly from the same greengrocer, he ought 



128 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

to let you have mushrooms in quite small quantities 
without always expecting you to embarrass yourself 
with more than you require. Lay the plaice in the 
dish and cover it with more butter, breadcrumbs, salt, 
pepper and parsley and, if possible, mushroom. 
Bake the fish for twenty minutes and serve it in the 
same dish. 



Fried fillets of plaice are universally known. 



In giving directions to prepare a plaice after the 
fashion of a sole au gratin, I must make it plain that 
every careless cook ought to skip this paragraph. 
The dish requires close attention. As cookery is still 
in an unscientific stage, culinary writers are obliged 
to use certain rough-and-ready expressions. For 
example, I shall have to speak merely of a quick oven ; 
because, if I should try to give the exact degree of heat 
required, I should be wasting my time, as oven ther- 
mometers are rarely to be seen. So let me warn the 
reader who is going to cook this dish that it will be 
wise to keep some extra stock at hand, in case the 
fish and the dressing should dry up at the critical 
moment. 

The plaice must be thick and plump. And, of 
course, you will clean it properly, taking off the head 
and the fins and the dark skin. Make your oven hot. 
Chop up some parsley, a small shalot, one or two 
mushrooms according to size, and about an ounce of 
bacon — the fat only. Mix all these with some very 
fine breadcrumbs, and season them with pepper and 



FISH 129 

salt. At the bottom of a fireproof dish, dab tiny 
pieces of butter. Over the butter spread some of the 
seasoning, and on the seasoning lay the fish. On 
top of the fish spread the rest of the seasoning. 
Add about half-a-gill of any sound white wine that 
is not very sweet, together with half-a-gill of good 
white stock. Grate some dry bread or sprinkle 
some fine crumbs over everything and lay one or two 
pellets of butter, no bigger than peas, here and there 
on the top. Bake the whole combination in a quick 
oven for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. 
Use your best judgment as to the suitable heat. On 
the one hand, you must not be opening the oven door 
repeatedly, and, on the other hand, you must not risk 
either too slow or too rapid baking. In the undesir- 
able and unlikely but still possible event of the sauce 
drying up, you will have a little hot stock at hand to 
moisten it. 

This is the true method of cooking a sole or plaice 
au gratin. For some reason, or none at all, there is an 
idea in certain kitchens that in order to prepare a 
dish au gratin there must be a final browning under a 
salamandre, always with a top skin of grated cheese ; 
and it is the sober truth that I have met people who 
think that the word gratin equals grated cheese in 
French. Of course the true meaning is the browning 
of a dish until it takes a crispness, above and 
below. 



I am going to speak of one more way of using 
plaice which may seem to be a little foolish, but it is 
worth knowing. When devising an economical menu, 



130 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

a housekeeper sometimes wants, at the stage when 
fish usually appears, an interesting and tasty but not 
ample item. If plaice or lemon sole happens to be 
cheap, it wiU often be possible to buy a quite small 
fillet for almost nothing. This can be cut to the shape 
and size of line whitebait. The pieces must be floured 
aU over as lightly as possible, and must then be fried 
in deep fat. To fry them properly a cheap wire frying 
basket, which will pay for itself over and over again, 
ought to be at hand. To make a good job of it, the 
little pieces of fish should be fried twice. After a first 
frying for about two minutes, they must be lifted out 
before they have turned brown and must be drained 
on paper. The fat having been again raised to 
boiling-point, the strips of fish can be fried till 
they are crisp and golden. They must be drained 
again and salted. [This, of course, is the correct 
way of cooking real whitebait also.] If the sham 
whitebait are served with care, slices of lemon and 
brown bread and butter not being grudged, the 
imitation of the real article will not be too lament- 
able a parody. 



I know that some housekeepers wiU feel shy about 
asking the fishmonger for very small portions of cheap 
fish, and that they wiU be unlikely to try the imita- 
tion whitebait if I do not suggest a way out. Let us 
therefore suppose that some more fish is bought at 
the same time and that it is not wanted until the next 
day. The surplus can be cooked at once and put on 
one side to be treated according to one or other of the 
methods now to be described. 



FISH 131 

For hot weather a good salad of fish is more pleasant 
than a friture. I take from a little book called 
*' Tasty Ways of Cooldng Fish " (which seems to be 
given away at Fislimongers' Hall by the National 
Sea Fisheries Protection Association) this recipe for 
Fish Salad by Mr C. Herman Senn : 



"Take i lb. cold fish, one potato (mashed), one 
lettuce, two tablespoonfuls salad oil, one tablespoonful 
vinegar, one hard-boiled e^g, one teaspoonful made 
mustard, one tablespoonful milk, one piece cooked 
beetroot, two pickled gherkins, parsley, salt, pepper, 
a pinch of castor sugar. Break up the fish into small 
pieces, removing the skin and bones. Wash the salad 
(lettuce or endive), tear into small pieces, and dry 
in a cloth. Mix the mashed potato with the milk, stir 
into it the oil and vinegar, season with mustard, pepper, 
salt and sugar. Mix v/ell, to produce a smooth dress- 
ing. Mix the salad v^ith the fish, season well with 
the prepared dressing. Pile up on a dish or salad 
bowl ; garnish Vvdth slices of gherkins, quarters of 
hard-boiled eg§ and slices of beetroot, and serve." 



Housekeepers who are likely to make frequent use 
of fish salads may simplify the work by keeping on hand 
some salad cream or mayonnaise. In a cool and dark 
place mayonnaise wiU remain good for nearly a week. 



In cold weather, fish salads would annoy many 
people. But nearly everybody enjoys cold fish 



132 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

.warmed up k la Russe. Free the fish from skin and 
bone, and fiake it with two fish forks. Chop up about 
a dozen capers and mix them with tv/o gills of white 
sauce which you have flavoured with some essence of 
anchovies. I am assuming that you are using up 
about a pound of cold fish, in which case a dessert- 
spoonful of anchovy essence will be required. While 
you are doing these things, some rice should be boiling 
on the fire, according to the directions given in the 
chapter on Entrees. Butter a fireproof dish and 
spread a layer of fish at the bottom of it. Over the 
fish spread rice and some of your sauce. Next lay on 
the sauce some slices of hard-boiled egg, as thin as 
you can cut them without breaking them up. Repeat 
these strata of fish, rice, sauce and shced eggs until 
the dish is full. You must take care to plan the 
matter so that slices of egg will be on top, as it would 
not do to finish with rice or fish. Here and there 
among the uppermost shoes of egg drop some good 
pellets of butter. Bake the whole for about twenty 
minutes in a moderate oven. Including the prime 
cost of the fish, the cost ought not to be more than 
about eighteenpence the lot, or about threepence 
for each good portion. 



Recipes for steamed fish puddings, for Kromeskies, 
for Kedgeree, and for Fish Rissoles are well and truly 
set forth in the ordinary cookery-books. It is pos- 
sible, however, that few readers have made little fish 
puddings after the fashion of custards. To make 
these you must chop up half-a-pound of cold fish, 
without skin or bone. You will want about a dozen 



FISH 133 

little moulds or basins, but if your family is small 
you can use moulds or basins for four or five custards 
only, and put the rest of your fish in a small pie-dish. 
Half fill the receptacles with the chopped fish. Now 
make a custard by beating up five yolks of eggs and 
the whites of three of the eggs in a basin, adding 
about three gills of milk. It should go without saying 
that you will not sweeten this custard. You will 
season it with pepper and salt ; and with some 
essence of anchovies if your cold fish was of some 
cheap and insipid kind. Pour this custard on the 
chopped fish till the moulds are nearly full. Place 
the moulds in a tin containing boiling water to the 
depth of about two inches. Lay little covers of 
greased paper over the moulds and bake them until 
the custards are set. Of course you will have greased 
your moulds at the outset and you should have no 
difficulty in turning out the custards without break- 
ing them. I do not recommend this dish except when 
eggs are cheap, although it must be borne in mind that 
two of the whites are available for other purposes. 
In the month of April I made fish custards like these 
at a cost of about a shilling for ten, and was able to 
fry the whites of the eggs as a bed for some hop-shoots, 
which cost me nothing at all. The hop-shoots were 
boiled in salted water until they were tender, and, 
after being tossed in butter, were served like lightning 
on white of egg fried at the table, 

A fish pie with macaroni or with potatoes is a very 
cheap dish and there is no reason why it should be 
unattractive. In houses where the habit of making 
good though simple sauces does not exist, a fish pie 
is often a trial to the appetite ; but when a house- 



134 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

keeper finds that some sauce remains over, as weU as 
some cold fish, her pie may become delightful. A 
simple procedure is to butter a pie-dish and to spread 
all over it the cold fish broken into morsels. The 
remains of sauce should be poured over the fish with 
some lemon juice and some pepper and salt. Some 
cooked potatoes, smoothly mashed with milk and 
seasonings and a little butter or even good dripping, 
must be laid on top of the fish and pressed well down 
with the blade of a broad knife. If an egg can be 
spared, let it be beaten up and let the top of the 
mashed potato be well brushed over with it. The 
pie must be baked in a moderate oven until it browns. 
Macaroni, as an ingredient in a fish pie, requires a 
little more skill. It must be boiled in a large pan, 
with plenty of room to move, until it is quite tender. 
When it has been drained and cut up small and mixed 
with whatever sauce may be on hand, it is to be laid 
over the pieces of fish. The best plan is to divide all 
the ingredients for this kind of pie into two parts, so 
that it will be in layers twice repeated. Breadcrumbs 
are sprinkled over the top, with small pieces of butter, 
and the pie is baked a nice brown. 



Turning back from these devices for using cold 
fish, and resuming the main business, I must refer the 
reader to the systematic cook-books for a hundred 
ways of handling familiar fish. But I am bound to 
draw attention to one or two neglected methods which, 
even when they are mentioned by British writers, are 
rarely practised in British kitchens. If we were to 
spend a year in a French household we should fre- 



FISH 135 

quently hear talk about fish cooked in court bouillon. 
" Court bouillon " may be literally translated " Short 
Broth " — that is to say, broth made in a very short 
space of time. Perhaps the simplest form of it is 
that which one meets with in some parts of Brittany. 
You mix water and milk in equal quantities, add a 
little salt, and bring the liquid to the boil. Turbot 
cooked in this broth makes a good invalid diet. After 
laying the fish in the liquid, bring the court bouillon 
once more to the boil, then draw the fish-kettle to the 
side of the fire with the lid on, and simmer the fish 
until it is tender. The court bouillon should cover the 
fish entirely, but should not drown it too deeply. 

A more elaborate but still cheap court bouillon is 
made by measuring out enough water to cover the 
piece of fish and mixing with it some light dry white 
wine (or half the quantity of white wine vinegar), 
a sliced onion, a thinly sliced carrot, some cloves, 
some peppercorns, and salt according to the kind of 
fish. You must boil all these things together for fifteen 
minutes, putting in the water a little mushn bag 
containing a bouquet of herbs. Meanwhile you 
sprinkle a little lemon juice over the fish, lay it on the 
tray of the fish-kettle, and, when the court bouillon is 
ready, you lower it into the liquid, of course taking 
out the bouquet. Put the lid on the kettle and cook 
the fish gently in the broth till it is done. Should 
scum rise to the surface of the broth, you must either 
skim it oH or expect it to spoil the look of your fish 
when you raise it from its bath. 

French cooks sometimes vary the foregoing recipe 
by using red wine instead of white. The court 
bouillon bleu is supposed to give a beautiful tint to 



136 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

certain fish, in some cases blue and in others more 
like mother-of-pearl. The eminent Jules Gouffe 
taught that this red (or bleu) court bouillon might be 
strengthened by the addition of some bones and 
trimmings from the fish. 

Court bouillon, made with either red wine or white 
wine, can be kept in a jar and used several times over. 
Like frying fat, which requires to be clarified and 
purged of any little fragments of batter or fish which 
may fall into it, court bouillon gives the cook a little 
trouble ; but it enables first-class results to be 
achieved at an insignificant cost. 

Fish that has been skinned, and soaked in salted 
milk, and coated hghtly with flour, can be laid in 
butter in a fireproof dish and seasoned with salt and 
pepper, and browned. The butter should be cooked 
to a golden colour before the fish is put in it. After 
the fish has itself taken the same golden-brown colour 
on both sides, it should be moistened with lemon 
juice, and afterwards with more of the brown butter. 
It is to be served with a sprinkling of chopped parsley 
and some very thin slices of lemon. A sole cooked in 
this way is a Sole k la Meuniere. 

Paper-bag cookery is explained in the chapter 
on Entrees, where a recipe will be found for Red 
mullet. 

With these typical prescriptions in her mind, and 
with the aid of the chapters on sauces and vegetables, 
an aspiring cook will have no difficulty in giving her 



FISH 137 

household a widely varied succession of fish dishes 
throughout the year. I warn her once more, how- 
ever, against putting forward a large and plain piece 
of fish as practically the whole of a meal. It is because 
they remember some dinner in boyhood, consisting of 
nothing but a boiled cod, with potatoes and parsley 
butter, that many Englishmen do not greatly care to 
taste another fish so long as they live. 



CHAPTER VIII 

ENTREES 

It is to be hoped that the greater simphcity of 
living imposed upon us by the War will lead to the 
simplifying of dinner-table terms. Cooks have never 
been as bad as gardeners, who give the ughest names 
they can think of to the loveliest flowers. Still, there 
is room for improvement. While Soup and Fish 
and Roast are good enough words for anybody, it is 
impossible to feel grateful for such terms as Hors 
d'oeuvre. Entrees, Releves and Entremets. They 
are far-fetched names, invented to express extra- 
vagances and elaborations which we have been 
steadily outgrowing. 



I am not going to waste time discussing the deriva- 
tion and history of the word " entree." It is neces- 
sary, however, to have an understanding with the 
reader as to the sense in which the term will be used 
in this chapter. By an entree I mean the made 
dish, complete in itself, which, on modern tables, 
follows the fish and precedes the roast. In the older 
practice, four entrees were supposed to be served, one 
of fish, one of flesh-meat, one of game and one of 
pastry. We will brush all this kind of thing on one 
side and confine ourselves almost entirely to entrees 
of meat and game. Before most of us were born,

there were supposed to be fully a thousand different 
entries known to professional cooks ; and some hun- 
dreds have been invented in our own days. We have 
all heard that, although scores of so-called comic 
papers appear every week, there are not more than a 
dozen or twenty distinct jokes in existence ; and 
something similar might be said about entrees. Under 
hundreds of different names they are found to be 
mostly shght variations upon the same culinary 
themes. Patrons and cooks in their vanity have 
hungered after immortality through the invention of 
a new entree ; but, like untrained explorers, they 
have too often given their names to territories dis- 
covered long^before. 



In this chapter I shall attempt nothing more than 
the making good of one or two defects in the kitchen 
routine of ordinary people. That is to say, I shall 
explain, by describing a few typical dishes, the 
principles on which innumerable entrees may be 
achieved. 



It has just been stated that an entree is a dish 
complete in itself. This means that it is exceedingly 
handy in houses where only modest service is obtain- 
able. A good entree may call for the taking of con- 
siderable pains ; but the pains are taken when there 
is time to spare. The hot lady whom we call a plain 
cook in England will sometimes tell you that " on- 
trays " are beyond her, and that she does not profess 
to go be37ond roast joints. Now, where there is a 



140 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

single-handed cook, or, worse still, a cook-general, 
the proper finishing off and serving up of a hot joint 
with gravy and vegetables is a far more formidable 
business than the making of a good entree. Indeed, 
when I see a cook-general engaged in the operation 
of serving the conventional Sunday dinner of the 
middle classes, I feel almost ashamed to satisfy my 
hunger at the expense of so great a trial to a fellow- 
creature's wits and strength and temper. The hot 
joint is an institution more in need of reform than 
the House of Lords. For a very large family or house - 
party, who can eat it down to the bare bone, a hot 
joint is fine and wholesome feeding ; but unfortun- 
ately it enslaves little households and sentences them 
to a weekly misery of cold meat, and more cold meat, 
and finally hash. With no more trouble, and at much 
less expense, three or four entries, one each day, can 
replace a single joint with far more gains than losses 
to the general health and happiness. 

Success in entree-making will often require the 
carrying out of at least two distinct processes, and 
this is where the English cook grows impatient. 
Take, for example, the operation of frying vegetables 
and pieces of meat before putting them in the casserole 
or stewpan. By this action the cook seals the out- 
sides of her materials so that their juices and flavours 
are not lost, or mixed with everything else. In many 
English ragouts this practice is neglected, with the 
result that one obtains an excellent gravy or broth 
containing meat and vegetables like tasteless rags. 
I must warn the reader that any indolent skipping of 
the prehminary frying in recipes where it is appointed 
will invariably result in failure. The cook who " can't 



ENTREES 141 

be bothered " to make an entree properly had better 
go on scorching her cheeks on Sunday over the hot 
joint, and shivering on Monday over the plateful of 
cold mutton. 



By reason of a defect in the English language, I 
have been forced to speak of frying in the foregoing 
paragraph, although the process in question differs 
from the true frying in a deep bath of fat so often 
referred to in other chapters. The deep bath of clear 
fat at a high temperature is not what is wanted when 
we set about to fry (or, as the French say, jaire 
revenir) our meat and vegetables for a ragout. With- 
out speculating on the origin of the curious French 
phrase, I will try to explain it practically. When a 
cook melts some butter or good dripping in a pan and, 
as soon as the fat is hot, lightly cooks her pieces of 
meat and vegetable therein, just long enough for 
them to take a nice brown colour, she is said to 
faire revenir the ingredients. Having said this, I 
shall rely on the reader to know what I mean 
whenever I refer to frying as a preliminary process, 
and not to use the deep bath except for dishes which 
are fried out-and-out, such as fried fillets of fish 
or apple fritters.^ 

Our first entrees shall be of the order of stews, 
one of beef and one of mutton. Both of them will 

* Some writers get over the difficulty by speaking of " dry 
frying " and " wet frying," the " wet " frying being the frying 
in a deep bath. I think " wet frying " is a dangerous ex- 
pression, as we are fighting the Enghsh tendency towards 
soddenness. 



142 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

be far better made in an earthenware casserole than 
in an enamelled stewpan. The casserole allows slower 
cooking and the meat is much less likely to stick to the 
bottom. Besides, the casserole can be carried straight 
to the table, thus saving the trouble of dishing up. 
A steaming casserole on a cold day has a homely look 
and puts everybody into the right mood. 

Buy about two pounds of the parts of beef known 
as stewing beef or skirting. Free them from skin and 
fat. Cut them up, salt them, pepper them and dip 
them in flour. Take some good turnips and carrots and 
onions, prepare them, cut them up, season them, and 
dip these also in flour. Having melted some good beef 
dripping in a pan, you must now proceed to fry {faire 
revenir) all the pieces till they take the desired brown 
colour. Meanwhile, a small kettleful of water should 
have been rising to the boiling-point. Take the pieces 
of meat and vegetables out of the pan and lay them 
at the bottom of a warmed casserole. There will 
remain in the pan the relics of the dripping and the 
flour. Pour over these some boiling water from the 
kettle and work them up into a gravy, scraping every- 
thing from the bottom of the pan and mixing it with 
the water as much as possible. Pour this gravy into 
the casserole with some mace and cinnamon and a 
bouquet of herbs. There should be just enough of 
the gravy to cover the vegetables and meat. Let 
the contents of the casserole come for a bare second 
to the boil, then draw the casserole to the side of the 
fire or leave it over the feeblest heat of which your 
gas-stove allows. The slower the cooking the better ; 
indeed, the lucky person with a range or an old- 
fashioned hob may let the cooking continue for four 



ENTREES 143 

or five hours. From time to time, examine the mess 
with a wooden spoon and make sure that nothing is 
sticking. \Miile the cooking must never cease, the 
heat must be much lower than boihng-point, in accord- 
ance with the old rule : "A stew boiled is a stew 
spoiled." When you sit down to eat this entree, you 
will find the meat and vegetables so flavoury that you 
will wish never again to eat the too familiar stew in 
which everything has gone to rags. Probably those 
who eat it with you will finish the meat and most of 
the vegetables, but some of the liquid may remain. 
You can make use of this on the morrow in dozens of 
ways, according to the materials which are on your 
hands. For example, you can boil some macaroni 
for not more than five minutes in plenty of boihng 
water, and, after draining it, transfer it to your thick 
broth and let it cook slowly, until it is impregnated 
with fine flavours and perfectly tender. Or, having 
fried more pieces of vegetables and meat, you can 
add them, with the new supply of gravy which results 
from the frying, to whatever is left in the casserole, 
of course bringing the old to the same heat as 
the new before mixing the two. As you will not 
wish to have similar dishes two days running, you 
can add a little red wine on the second day ; or let 
the contents of the casserole be accompanied by a 
puree of potatoes, or Jerusalem artichokes, or of 
turnips, served in a separate dish. 

The stew of beef just described is a very homely 
one for family use, and it can be made cheaper or 
dearer by varying the proportions of meat and vege- 
tables. I have known a clever housewife with a 
large family who kept a stew of this kind in being for 



144 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

five days without anybody beginning to feel that it 
was monotonous. On the last day it contained 
practically no meat, but was made substantial with 
some dried peas and haricot beans which had been 
soaked and swollen for twenty-four hours. Of course 
she dissembled her economy by serving the stew in 
different receptacles on three days and in the casserole 
itself on the other two. 



We will turn from a ragout of beef to a ragout of 
mutton. I do not doubt that, at one time or another, 
a small loin of mutton finds its way into almost every 
house. At one end of the loin the chops are nearly 
all meat, but at the other end they degenerate into a 
big bone. I suggest that this bone-end of the loin be 
cut off and treated as follows : — 

Peel half-a-dozen potatoes of middling size. Then 
make a roux and prepare a bouquet. You ought to 
know the meaning of both these terms, but, in case 
you were never taught or have forgotten them, I will 
briefly explain them both. A roux is made of flour 
fried in downright good dripping or in butter. I am 
not referring to the method of frying in a deep bath of 
fat but to frying in a pan. While the frying goes on, 
the cook stirs the mixture all the time to prevent the 
forming of lumps. You must use a wooden spoon. 
For a brown roux you put an ounce of butter to one 
dessertspoonful of flour. Melt the butter in a stewpan 
on a moderate fire, add the flour, stir briskly, and as 
soon as the colour shows quite brown, pour in little 
by little half-a-pint of stock. If you have no stock, 
water will do. If you are in a hurry, cold water or 



ENTREES 145 

cold stock can be used, though I think it is better hot. 
All the time you are pouring in the hot or cold stock 
or water go on stirring, stirring, stirring, until the 
roux is quite smooth. To make a white roux you 
ought to have a rather gentler heat than for a brown 
roux. Do not let the flour and butter become dark. 
Avoid browning, avoid lumpiness, and use a white 
stock made from the remains of a fowl, or from white 
dried haricots. For what is called by professional 
cooks a roux blond, cook the flour and butter not 
much beyond a biscuit colour and use water or white 
stock. 

A bouquet consists of a small bay leaf, some thyme, 
one or two sprigs of parsley, and, if possible, some 
basil and some marjoram. You tie these tightly 
together with white cotton. Some people add a strip 
of lemon peel. I admit that this sounds trouble- 
some, but, when a housekeeper has once got into the 
way of using a bouquet, it will seem as natural as 
using salt and pepper. Of course the tying of the 
bouquet with cotton is intended to facilitate its 
removal after it has done its work. If you cannot get 
a bouquet such as I have described, you can use dried 
herbs tied up in a piece of muslin ; but you must 
take care that your dried herbs have not lost their 
savour. Many housekeepers buy dried herbs in 
foolish little cardboard boxes which seem to have 
been invented for the purpose of making them dryer 
than ever. It will be far cheaper in the end to 
buy good herbs and to keep them in little air-tight 
tins. 

Having reached a good understanding about the 
roux and the bouquet, we can return to our mutton. 

K 



146 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

Put half-a-pint of brown roux into a stewpan ; or 
rather make the roux in the stewpan there and then. 
Bring it to the boil. Put in your piece of mutton, 
with an onion (not too large), the bouquet, some 
pepper and salt and a clove. Boil all these things 
gently for half-an-hour. Then add your peeled 
potatoes and let the boiling go on for half-an-hour 
longer. For everybody who likes a potato, this 
homely dish is delightful. As for those who are 
satisfied with nothing but huge helpings of the best 
meat, they must not expect to lift more meat out of 
the stewpan than was put in. 

The directions just given will apply to a knuckle of 
ham, with one exception. The ham being salt, you 
must omit the salt which was prescribed for the 
mutton. 

For this stew, whether of mutton or of ham, you 
do not " faire revenir " the meat. The meat is too 
poor to seal and you let it give its virtues to the 
potatoes. 



I will now be very bold indeed and will recommend 
an entree which, at the first blush, will strike you as 
both difficult and extravagant. It is neither ; and 
it has the charm of antiquity. Indeed it is one of the 
oldest dishes in the French cuisine and is called a 
Galimafree. Historians differ as to the true Galima- 
free, and I will not be dogmatic about it. Some say 
that it was a ragout of sheep's head and pluck ; others 
that it was made from a steak of ham, about an inch 
thick, served with a great number of tender vegetables 
and moistened with white wine ; others again, that 



ENTREES 147 

fowls were the principal ingredients I am going to 
describe an entirely different Galimafree. Buy a 
small shoulder of mutton weighing not more than 
about three pounds and a half. If you feel that the 
task will be beyond you, ask the butcher to separate 
the skin from the flesh, making it plain to him that the 
skin is to be lifted all in one piece, so that it can be put 
back in its place. As his knives are sharper than 
yours, ask him at the same time to cut off the meat 
from the bone entirely. At this stage he will prob- 
ably wish to argue with you, and will tell you that 
what you really wish him to do is to bone the mutton. 
Now the boning of mutton — that is to say, the clever 
separation of the meat from the principal bone — is a 
trick worth knowing, because it enables many ex- 
cellent methods to be foUowed, especiaUy with the 
leg of mutton ; but it is not what you want for a 
Galimafree, where the skin is detached from the meat 
as well as the meat from the bone, and where it is not 
necessary for the meat to come away in one piece. 
When these surgical operations are finished, you 
will mince the meat finely, you wilJ mix with it a little 
chopped bacon, some chopped lemon peel and some 
fine herbs, and you will cook the mixture, moistened 
with a little stock in a pan, keeping it well stirred. 
Of course you will take care that it is not in the least 
sloppy. When, by taste and smell and sight, you 
perceive that it is cooked, you wiU build it into what 

^ As old-fasliioned Frenchmen still express their contempt 
for a rambhng sermon or speech by calling it a " galimafree," I 
suspect that the word could be applied in cookery to any hotch- 
potch. In my recipe, the name is appropriate because the 
meat is cut up and mixed with flavoury morsels and herbs. 



148 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

I may call the empty shell of your shoulder of mutton, 
the bone forming a support. You wiU very carefully 
bring back the skin to its original position and will 
tie it in place with a string. Flour it all over and bake 
it in the oven just long enough for the floured skin to 
take a good colour, so that the whole appears to be an 
ordinary roasted or baked joint. This last stage of 
the process will be quite short, as the meat has been 
separately cooked. It would appear that this kind 
of Galimafree was served with a sauce like Ravigote. 
I am quite prepared to hear that the foregoing 
recipe will provoke mirth, and that most readers will 
flatly dechne to spoil a good shoulder of mutton on 
such lines. But, as a suitable shoulder can be bought 
for half-a-crown, and sometimes for less, the dish is 
surely worth trying once in a lifetime. When I go on 
to say that it is economical, the scoffer will agree 
with me on the ground that a very little of it wiU go 
a very long way. In a sense, he is right. This dish 
admits of being eaten along with an exceptional 
proportion of vegetables ; because the herbs and 
lemon juice and bacon, and the retention of all the 
gravy in the meat itself, make it very fiavoury. In 
practice I find it both distinguished and economical ; 
but of course this is a recipe to be followed only once 
or twice in the year. 



I should have found it easier to describe the Gahma- 
free if I could have used the words mince or hash as 
the French understand them ; but unhappily the 
mince and the hash are terms with evil associations 
in English households. So perhaps this will be a 



ENTREES 149 

good place for some short notes on the true hash and 
the true mince, in which economy is practised without 
causing disgust. Indeed the true mince is thoroughly 
relevant to this book, because it lends itself remark- 
ably well to our great principle of economising by 
making intelligent use of what is already in the larder. 
Whatever your remains of meat may be, flesh or fowl 
boiled or roasted, grilled or stewed, you can go 
ahead. 

My first advice to an English cook who wants to 
make a good mince is to take her mincing machine, to 
clean it thoroughly, and then to lock it away in a box 
or a drawer for the rest of the morning. Old-fashioned 
cutting and chopping and mincing with a knife may 
seem more troublesome, but when the quantity of 
material is small, it is really not much more bother 
than is required for mounting the machine and work- 
ing it and finally cleaning it. Without the machine, 
one is much more careful to reject gristle and skin ; 
and the disagreeable mushiness of the ordinary mince 
is avoided. Chop up what you have. Add to it 
some pepper and salt and breadcrumbs, using one 
dessertspoonful of breadcrumbs to nine of your 
chopped meat and varying the salt and pepper 
according to the quantities used when the meat or 
game was first cooked. Take care that there is a 
little fat in your mixture. If you should have in the 
house an uncooked sausage, you would do well to 
draw the sausage meat out of the skin and to add it 
to your mince, taking care that you have at least five 
or six times as much mince as sausage meat. Chop 
up some parsley and a shalot if you have one ; but 
do not mix the shalot with the mince at first. Melt 



150 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

a piece of butter in a stewpan and stir the minced 
shalot in it until it begins to brown ; then throw in 
the whole of the mince, add a teaspoonful of flour 
and the chopped parsley, and go on stirring for fully 
five minutes. You should have made ready a little 
good broth, or gravy, or the best stock you have 
managed to extract. Pour this in very slowly, using 
only a very small quantity — I cannot say how much, 
because I do not know how much mince you will be 
making, but not enough to make the mince look 
sodden. Now let the cooking continue for half-an- 
hour over a very slow fire or a very small gas-jet, 
keeping the lid on the pan. 

You will understand that no mince can be much 
better than the meat or game from which it is made. 
But the trouble with lazy or incompetent cooks is that 
their minces nearly always turn out much worse than 
their ingredients. With a good mince, dozens of fine 
things can be done. For example, on a cold day, few 
things are more comforting than a mince with mashed 
potatoes. A good old-fashioned English way is to 
prepare some mashed potatoes, varying the butter and 
pepper and salt according to the fatness or leanness of 
your mince, and to build the potatoes up in a high 
ring in a round fireproof dish. By a ring I mean 
something like the circular forts of sand which children 
make on the seashore, with room to stand inside. 
The mashed potatoes are carefully raised up in this 
fashion, and the mince is neatly packed within it. 
By browning the whole affair in the oven, one pro- 
duces something of the effect of a raised meat pie, but 
with a casing of potatoes instead of more expensive and 
less digestible pie-crust. 



ENTREES 151 

I come to braising. The cook who has made her- 
self mistress of braising is in a position to practise the 
utmost economies, while producing some of the most 
covetable dishes. Braising is one of the most ancient 
of culinary processes. \\Tien prehistoric man came 
home to his cave with the kid which he had stolen, or 
with the wild piglet which his arrow had pierced, 
prehistoric woman soon learned to braise a dinner 
with herbs in a clay pot. She covered the pot with a 
rough hd of clay and heaped smouldering embers 
above it. True braising must always maintain the 
same old principles, and the best results are not to be 
obtained without the beating down as well as the 
rising up of a steady heat. The lid of a true braising- 
vessel is so made that it will contain glowing charcoal, 
which causes the meat and vegetables to be caught 
between two fires. 

I recognise, hov/ever, the uselessness of upholding 
standards which few readers will follow. I must 
therefore assume that a true braising-pan is absent 
from most English kitchens and that the house- 
keepers who buy this book will not trot off to the iron- 
monger's to make good the defect. We must do the 
best we can with our stev/pans and casseroles. The 
Germans speak of braising by a name equivalent to 
our word " smothering," by which they mean that 
braised meats are smothered in an aromatic sauce 
and in an atmosphere of steam which cannot escape. 
It follows that the lid of the vessel must fit well. 
When the vessel is placed in an oven, a great deal of 
heat strikes down from the oven-top, thus doing some 
of the work performed by the glowing charcoal in a 
true braising-pot. There are times, however, when 



152 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

the top heat may be dispensed with, and when it will 
suffice to apply bottom heat only from a gas-jet to 
a well-covered vessel. 



At this point we are on the threshold of a great 
principle in cookery which will enable the novice to 
escape many a familiar disaster. I will try to express 
the principle by roughly stating the great difference 
between a " sealed " ragout and a dish of braised meat. 
In a sealed ragout, as I have already explained, we 
fry our pieces of meat and vegetables so as to seal up 
their juices. When braising, on the other hand, we 
endeavour to impregnate our slices of meat with the 
flavours of a kind of sauce which is called a braise 
or a mirepoix. A braise or mirepoix is a strong and 
important blend of gravy, both animal and vegetable, 
while the liquid in a ragout is generally mere water 
or a stock of no marked flavour. In a ragout we 
keep the surrounding liquid out ^ ; in a braised dish 
the meat gently draws it in. 



I will give a simple illustration of braising. One 
night a friend asked me to go with him to his house, 
which had been closed for a week. The house stood 
right out in the country, and there was no inn within 
two or three miles. Knowing that, after making his 
round of the little property, we should have an hour 
or two to kill before we could get a train back to town 
and to a decent meal, my friend took with him from 

^ The kind of ragout called an Irish stew is an exception, 
as it aims at giving flavour to the potatoes. 



ENTREES 153 

London a neat packet of ham sandwiches. We un- 
locked the cottage and opened the windows, but had 
hardly finished our inspection before the sky darkened 
and a cold rain began to fall. We unpacked our 
sandwiches. They had been cut in the kitchen of a 
well-known hotel and no less than half-a-crown had 
been charged for them ; but those sandwiches looked 
extremely dreary in the chilly twihght. A happy 
thought came to me. In the kitchen I had noticed 
a small, shallow casserole. While my accomplice 
broke up an empty packing-case and kindled a merry 
little fire, I foraged in the pantry and the store 
cupboard. The shelves were almost bare, but I 
stumbled upon a bottle of Marsala. The cork had 
evidently been first drawn nine or ten days before, 
but this was a powerful Marsala and was still fit to 
drink. I found also some tomato catsup — perhaps 
a tablespoonful and a half, at the bottom of a screw- 
stoppered bottle. We washed some plates and dis- 
membered the sandwiches, putting each man's bread- 
and-butter in a little pile, and forking together the 
slices of ham. I chopped up finely a little of the fat 
of the ham and put it at the bottom of the casserole 
to melt. The melting was not entirely satisfactory, 
but it might have been worse. By leaning out of the 
kitchen window I easily gathered three or four nastur- 
tium seeds which were still young and tender. These 
seeds were minced up finely and were thrown into the 
casserole with a mixture of Marsala and tomato 
catsup. We laid in the liquid a slice of ham, and 
covered it with a crisp little curling leaf from a lettuce 
which was growing not half-a-dozen yards from the 
scullery door. Upon the lettuce we laid more ham 



154 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

and more lettuce until no more ham remained. By 
this time the fire had been coaxed into good order and 
was burning, or rather smouldering, quietly. The 
heat needed keeping up with bits of less dry wood, but 
we managed to do this without letting it blaze. 

Although the lid of the casserole fitted well, the 
kitchen soon grew homely with goodly vapours. 
When the pot was opened, our hearts began to sing. 
The escape of steam had been small, and the ham had 
played a fine game of give-and-take with the sauce. 
The sauce had cut away the grossness from the fat 
ham, and the ham had softened the sharp temper of 
the sauce. Two hours later, when we were safely 
back in town, we made the experiment of ordering for 
supper some jamhon braise au Madere ; but it was not 
to be compared with what we had eaten at a deal 
table, with the rain drumming on the leaves in the 
windless twihght. 

If we had reversed the casserole lid, and had filled 
it with red-hot embers, our dish would have been an 
example of the truest braising. The reason why we 
did not use top as weU as bottom heat was that the 
result would not have repaid the extra trouble. The 
top heat is wanted for fairly large pieces of meat, or 
for birds, rather than for meat in sHces. Towards 
the end of the process of braising, which must be as 
long and slow as possible, the sauce or mirepoix is 
reduced in volume and the top of the meat appears 
above the surface, like the summit of Mount Ararat 
after the Deluge. If, at this stage, the top heat is 
applied, it browns the meat and gives to it that very 
slight caramel-like taste of fire which is acceptable 
to the palate of every woman and of nearly all men. 



ENTREES 155 

In my own practice, I use the simple method of 
braising just described for all kinds of materials and 
on all sorts of occasions. It turns many a poor and 
dry little slice of meat into a dish fit for a queen, or 
even for a prima donna. Still, I know that braising 
is conducted on rather different lines by cooks far more 
intelligent and accomplished than I can hope to 
become. These cooks give directions which should 
often be followed, especially when one is dealing with 
larger pieces of meat or game which cannot be sliced 
or cut small. Melt a little bacon or butter or good 
dripping at the bottom of a roomy stewpan. While 
it is slowly liquefying, mix together a number of little 
dice which have been cut from a turnip, some carrots, 
a big onion and a stick of celery. The usual advice 
is to have equal quantities of dice from all four vege- 
tables, but I have often varied them and have added 
dice cut from Jerusalem artichokes, from leeks, from 
sea-kale, from salsify and from tomatoes. Lay these 
dice to a depth of nearly two inches in the bottom of 
the stewpan, tie up a mixture of herbs in muslin and 
throw the little bag, with reasonable pepper and salt, 
on top of the dice. Before putting the meat to rest 
in this fragrant bed, trim it carefully and give it a 
dusting of flour. [Some pieces of meat will require 
tying round neatly with tape, in which case you will, 
of course, use a tape that has not been injuriously 
coloured.] Heap more dice on the meat. Put the 
pan on a fire that is not too slow, and cook the con- 
tents for twelve or fifteen minutes, the pan being 
covered with the lid. Taking a wooden spoon, you 
must occasionally prevent the dice of vegetables from 
sticking to the bottom of the pan, unless you have 



156 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

a wrist strong and skilful enough to give the right kind 
of a shake, which is better than stirring with a spoon. 
As soon as the meat shows by its brown colour that 
the cooking has well begun, pour in some broth, or 
broth and wine, or plain stock, or even water, using 
no more than will just drown the bottom layer of 
vegetables. 

Replace the lid and let the cooking go on for three 
or four or even five hours, according to the size and 
kind of meat you are using. Remember that while 
on the one hand the cooking must not cease for a 
moment, on the other hand it must never go beyond 
the gentlest possible simmering. A range with a coal 
fire is better than a gas-stove for braising, as a far 
gentler simmering can be effected in a pan drawn 
almost away from the fire. Further, I find a casserole 
worlds better than any other vessel. If you conduct 
the braising in an oven, so as to benefit by the top 
heat from the oven roof, you are advised by the best 
cooks to cover the top of the meat with a sheet of 
greased paper. I have never been in love with this 
device, as paper is not always all one would like it to 
be. I use a rather deeper casserole than is usual, 
with plenty of head room for the vapours and I do 
not find my little messes any the worse. Of course 
I take care to glance at the meat now and then and to 
baste it with the liquid whenever it shows signs of 
becoming too dry. 

When the braising is finished, the meat must be 
lifted out of the sauce. In a clean and much smaller 
pan, the sauce must be brought to the boil and kept 
at boiling-point for a few minutes. Some hot water 
or stock can be added if the original sauce has become 



ENTREES 157 

excessively reduced. The boiling will bring the grease 
to the top. As soon as the grease has been skimmed 
away, the sauce is poured over the meat, which is at 
last ready for eating. 



With these two ways of braising at your fingers' 
ends, your shopping will become a new experience. 
Where you have been accustomed to confine yourself 
to a narrow range of materials, you will find yourself 
yearning to make new experiments. The cookery- 
books will tell you how to braise the cheaper cuts of 
mutton, and liver, and sheep's tongues, and many 
another neglected cut or morsel. But, over and above 
the books, ideas will come to you. 

Of course you will not braise greasy materials. 
Salmon, for example, does not invite braising. Yet 
some kinds of fish, after they are caught, take to brais- 
ing as they took to water when they were alive. One 
night I ate with some friends a turbotin, or chicken 
turbot, which had been braised in Chambertin. It 
was served with a cream of mushrooms sharpened 
by a few drops of lemon juice. This sounds extra- 
vagant ; but an almost equally good result could be 
cheaply obtained with a shillingsworth of fish and 
mushrooms and a few pennyworth of sound Macon 
Ordinaire. 



The housekeeper who will take the trouble to under- 
stand the use of curry and the boiling of rice will have 
travelled a long way on the path of wisdom. It is 
important to go to a good shop and to get genuine 



158 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

curry and to study the directions which the shopman 
is nearly always ready to give you. Some years ago 
an Anglo- Indian advised me always to cook curry 
powder in a pan with a little butter and flour just 
before using it, and I have never regi'etted following 
his advice. Too many cookery-books treat curry as 
if it is to be merely thrown into any appropriate con- 
coction, as one throws in a small handful of salt. 
And not less important than the curry powder is the 
rice. Colonel Kenney-Herbert, who wrote several 
valuable books about cookery, learned in India the 
best way of boiling rice. His method is simple. 
Having prepared three ounces of good rice, by sifting 
it and washing it well, put it into a pan where a quart 
of water is already boiling. If you add to the water 
the juice of a quarter of a lemon you will get a whiter 
mess of rice in the end. Do not oversalt the water, 
as is usually done in England. A teaspoonful for 
the quantity we are discussing should be the maxi- 
mum. The rice must be boiled with the lid off the 
pan. Introduce frequently a wooden fork, such as is 
used for salads, and stir the rice so that it wiU move 
freely in the water and will not stick to the pan. In 
rather less than a quarter of an hour the rice should 
be cooked. Test it by taking a grain and squeezing 
it. The grain should be tender without losing its 
form. The moment you find that the boihng has gone 
far enough, stop it by throwing in a cupful of water. 
Drain away all the water, leaving the rice in the pan. 
Put the pan back on a gentle heat and cover it with 
a napkin, so that the heat will be retained while the 
moisture is absorbed. Give another occasional stir- 
ring, so as to keep the grains well separated. If you 



ENTREES 159 

have performed this simple operation properly, and 
if you have used the right kind of rice — namely, the 
Patna rice,^ which is white and large-grained and 
shapely — you will be looking at a beautiful sight as 
well as at a cheap and useful food. 

Almost every kind of food can be curried. And 
curried dishes lend themselves to economy for a 
further reason. When a curry is served, there ought 
to be plenty of it, but it should not be followed by 
other cooked dishes. I have been present at a long 
meal in which the curried entree was followed by a 
delicate roast and an admirable champagne of the 
1900 vintage, both the food and the drink being ruined 
by the curry. We can quite properly lead up to a 
curry, through hors d'ceuvre and soup ; but we cannot 
follow it except with refreshing fruit or with a savoury 
as ardent as the curry itself. A housekeeper with a 
good instinct for her work will therefore serve curries 
not too often but, when the occasion comes, lavishly 
and to the exclusion of almost everything else, thus 
saving both labour and expense. 

I have found the following materials wonderfully 
good when they are curried: — aubergine, beef, cauli- 
flower, chicken, crab, eggs, most kinds of fish, mutton, 
rabbits, cold turkey, turnips, and veal. 



Although a_ Salmis of game often figures in menus 
at restaurants, it is too rarely met with in English 

1 In 1911-12 a caterer, who wished to do the right thing, 
was found by a friend of mine to be buying both Patna and 
CaroUna rice; but he used the "Patna for Puddings" and 
" CaroUna for Curries " with lamentable results. 



i6o HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

home cookery. It is essential to a true salmis that 
it should be made of game which has been roasted 
beforehand. If you should follow the directions about 
to be given without having first roasted your game, 
you might produce an enjoyable result, but it would 
not be a salmis. By visiting the poulterer regularly 
you will often be able to buy game as cheaply as meat, 
and this game, when worked up into a true salmis, will 
go along way, besides satisfying your reasonable desire 
for variety and distinction. And there is another 
respect in which a salmis becomes a money -saver. 
Let us suppose that somebody has sent you a brace of 
birds and that, after being served roasted, a fair 
amount of meat remains on the bones when they come 
back from the table. By buying and roasting one 
more small bird (not necessarily of the same species) at 
the cost of about a shilling, you can make a salmis 
large enough for four persons. Again, if you happen 
to have a httle roast mutton you may cut this up 
into rather thick pieces and it will so take the flavour 
of the game as to make the salmis quite good enough 
for six persons. 

Here is the method. At the bottom of your stew- 
pan put at least two ounces of butter and add a 
tablespoonful of flour. Cook them, stirring them all 
the time, until they melt together and take a good 
brown colour. Pour in very gradually a gill of stock 
and a gill of good wine. [I must explain that, 
if you are able to do it, the stock should be well 
made from the skeleton of another bird. The wine 
must be red wine if the flesh of your game is dark, 
and white if the flesh be light.] Next, add pepper 
and salt, a bouquet of herbs, two shalots (not cut 



ENTREES i6i 

up) and the carcass of your game-bird, from which 
you have carefully cut the limbs and all the meat, 
except such as could only be detached in pieces of 
insignificant size. You do not at this stage put in 
the meat and limbs, but you boil everything that is in 
the stewpan for half-an-hour, taking care that it does 
not boil at all fiercely. Then you pour the contents 
of the pot or pan through a colander — not a sieve — 
so that the shalots and bouquet and bones remain 
behind. Pour the liquid back into the pan, and bring 
it once more to boiUng-point. At the first bubbling, 
drop in all the good pieces of game and withdraw the 
stewpan immediately from the fire. Squeeze a little 
lemon juice into the liquid, replace the pan lid with- 
out delay, and stand the pan where it will keep warm 
but will not even sinomer. The reason why simmering- 
point must not be reached is that everything by this 
time is cooked, because your game had been roasted 
before you dropped it into the boiling gravy. It 
would not do, however, to serve the salmis immedi- 
ately. It must stand on the warm hob or in a tin of 
hot water for half-an-hour longer, so that the pieces 
of cold roast game may be warmed through by the 
surrounding gravy and so that they may become 
impregnated with the flavours of the wine and the 
herbs and the shalots and the condiments. The 
finished salmis is often served with a good decorative 
effect, at practically no extra expense, each wing or 
leg or other good piece of game being placed on a 
rather thick piece of toast. The toasts are arranged 
on a very hot dish and the gravy, which is smooth 
and thick, is poured over them, with crimped shces 
of lemon encircling the whole. 



i62 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

In homely and unceremonious circumstances you 
can apply the principles of a salmis to roast meat 
or to a mixture of roast meat with such cheap game 
as rabbits. A week before I began to write this 
book, I helped to eat a salmis of rabbit and veal which 
did not cost more than fourpence for each person, 
although the portions were ample and the finish of the 
salmis was worthy of a professional cook. 



It will be worth while to glance back over this 
chapter and to note the resemblances and differences in 
the directions for the various stews, braises and similar 
preparations. I have told you of a stew in which 
the solid ingredients are sealed by frying ; about 
another stew in which the meat is not sealed but yields 
its juices and flavours to some potatoes ; about some 
braised meats which absorb the sauce in which they 
are cooked ; and about a salmis of unsealed but roasted 
meat warmed up in a gravy and flavoured by it . After 
reflecting on these points, an intelligent cook will 
discern the why and wherefore of some of the most 
important processes and she will become more and 
more independent of those closely detailed recipes 
which have discouraged so many beginners. 



While I cannot include paper-bag cookery among the 
great processes, I recommend it to ladies who wish to 
do their own cooking in flats or in very small houses. 
The odours proceeding from a good kitchen are de- 
lightful at the right time and in the right place, but 
nobody wants the smell of cooking, however good it 



ENTREES 163 

may be, to invade a drawing-room or a bedroom. 
Paper bags certainly score so far as smells are con- 
cerned. It is also fairly claimed for them that they 
involve less labom*, and that the food cooked in them 
loses little of its weight. All the same, I am sorry 
when I find anybody making a fetich of the paper bag. 
As Mr Soyer himself admits, cooking in paper is no 
novelty. The first act of cookery which I committed 
in my green youth was simply the \vrapping up of a 
newly caught and cleaned fish in a sheet of buttered 
paper and the cooking thereof in a kind of oven 
roughly formed of slabs of stone by the side of a lake. 
From that day onwards I have loved fish cooked in 
paper, and I think Mr Soyer did a good work when he 
introduced his special bags made of a paper which is 
tasteless and odourless and harmless. 



A few red mullet will lend themselves admirably to 
paper-bag cookery, because this fish may be said to 
provide its own sauce when it is baked. From the 
liver of a red mullet there comes a gravy which no 
sauce cook could excel. Into a buttered bag you 
simply put the mullet with an additional large pellet 
of butter and a little salt. You cook the fish for 
about twenty minutes. The other kinds of fish may 
require more seasoning, such as chopped parsley, 
mushrooms, tomatoes and the like. A good paper 
bag will hold liquids also, and this means that you 
can use it even when you wish to cook a fish in 
sauce or stock or white wine. 

Directions for paper-bag cookery are usually given 
with the bags and there is no need to repeat them 



i64 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

here. I must, however, remind the reader emphatic- 
ally that the use of a grid is absolutely essential and 
that disaster will follow the placing of a bag on a 
solid oven-shelf. 

If you have no bags in the house, you can fall back 
on the method which good cooks used before we were 
born. Cut a sheet of white paper, of good quality, 
into the shape of a heart. Place the paper with the 
point of the heart pointing towards you. Having 
trimmed and seasoned, say, a loin chop, lay it on the 
right-hand side of the heart. Of course you will have 
greased the paper all over. Fold the left-hand side 
over the chop and twist the edges of the paper to- 
gether where they meet. Bake the bag and its 
contents on a grid, in a hot oven, for a quarter of an 
hour. You can apply the same method to steaks, to 
veal cutlets, to kidneys, to liver and bacon and to all 
sorts of cuts of meat and fish and game. But get it 
out of your mind that paper bags can take the place 
of all pots and pans. You must not, for example, 
use them for cauliflowers or cabbages or beans or 
artichokes or macaroni. 



With the great processes well rooted in your mind, 
and with the paper bag for a change, you will soon be 
able to contrive a markedly different entree for every 
day in the month. And if you \vill master the rudi- 
ments of good sauce-making, and will grasp the 
principles of garnishing entrees, I make bold to say 
that you will be able to achieve a different entree for 
every day in the year. This would be too great a 
variety, as it would rob you of the pleasure of repeat- 



ENTREES 165 

ing a favourite dish ; but you might do worse than 
keep it before you as an ideal. 



Having referred to garnishes, I will try very briefly 
to guide your studies. When you open a serious 
cookery-book by one of the great masters, you may be 
inclined to smile at the almost endless lists of dishes. 
On examining the recipes you will find that the variety 
is worked out from three opportunities. The culinary 
inventor's first opportunity lies in the great variety 
of materials, animal and vegetable ; the second comes 
through the variety of methods of cooking them ; 
the third (and this is the biggest of all) flows from the 
possibility of accompanying the cooked food with 
garnishes or sauces or a combination of both. 

When a housekeeper whose ignorance of cooking is 
almost complete decorates a plate of cold ham from 
a shop with a few sprigs of parsley, she has made a 
true garnish. When she goes further, and arranges 
squares or lozenges of toast around a hash, she is 
garnishing again ; and when a millionaire's French 
chef surrounds a Poularde Wellington with twenty 
little pyramids of vegetables all different, or presents 
a fish in a sauce made of wine and mushrooms and 
mussels and prawns and asparagus tips, he too is 
garnishing. As soon as we call to mind the enormous 
number of greenstuffs, and gherkins, and shell-fish, 
and small roots (such as radishes), and vegetables, big 
and little, and tit-bits (such as the livers of fowls), and 
mint and horse-radish, and literally hundreds of other 
things, we must cease to marvel at the thousands of 
combinations which are defined in the great manuals 



i66 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

of cookery, and we shall cease to smile incredulously 
when we hear that new dishes are always being devised. 
Of course I am now alluding to genuine practice, and 
not to the sham novelties of advertising restaurateurs. 



We shall best reach this book's goal of economy 
without stodginess if we continue to invoke our prin- 
ciple of using only those materials which we possess 
already in the larder, or can most easily obtain. Let 
the chapter on Sauces be read, and, as it is necessarily 
slight in a volume of this kind, let it be regarded as 
merely the beginning of study. Let the much fuller 
chapter on Vegetables be glanced through from time to 
time. Let the shelves of the pantry be scanned for 
pickles or capers or bottled sauces or Italian pastes, 
or remainders of the day's milk or breadcrumbs that 
would otherwise be wasted. And then, with stewed or 
braised or baked or roasted or boiled or steamed meat 
or fish or game for the centre, it will be easy to vary 
one's entrees cheaply, pleasantly, healthfully and 
almost without end. 



CHAPTER IX 

VEGETABLES 

Vegetables were defined by a pert child at an 
examination as " The food eaten by Vegetarians." 
If the pert child meant to use the word " vegetables " 
in its widest sense, so as to include nuts and grains, 
he was right ; but if his thoughts ran only on vege- 
tables as commonly understood, the definition had 
precious little in it . My experience is that vegetarians 
do not eat ordinary vegetables much more largel}^ 
than do we who prefer a mixed dietary. I have tried 
vegetarianism, as a young man, with a predisposition 
in its favour, and have eaten at least a hundred 
vegetarian meals under the auspices of true believers. 
On the whole, I believe that vegetables are better 
cooked in a meat-eater's than in a vegetarian's 
kitchen. Should this book happen to fall into the 
hands of any reasonable vegetarian, I hope he will 
glance without prejudice through the pages next 
following, and give my recipes a trial as I have given 
his. 



English methods of vegetable cookery have been 
denounced rather more warmly than they deserve. 
In so far as we have a national "high cookery" in 
rivalry with la haute cuisine Frangaise, it is based 
upon our preference for the finest materials simply 
167 



i68 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

presented. This preference connotes a dislike for 
sauces and garnishes which might distract the palate 
from the prime joint or fine sole or freshly taken 
salmon which is being eaten. I do not intend, there- 
fore, to blame our cooks for serving, with the best 
meats, plain water-boiled vegetables, provided they 
prepare them carefully. This book, however, is 
written in the hope that the most costly meats and 
fishes and birds will be bought less frequently, and it 
follows that a different touch must play upon the 
vegetables. 



Unfortunately, as soon as they perceive our national 
defects, most young housewives fly too decidedly to 
the French extreme, and they cease serving plain 
vegetables almost entirely. Every pea or French 
bean must be saute ; every inch of celery must be au 
jus. Every cabbage must be enriched with butter, 
and every cauliflower must be hidden under yellow 
sauce. This is a grand error. When they are at their 
youngest and tenderest, peas and French beans are 
best in the English way, by which I mean gentle 
cooking in not much more vapour than that which 
they themselves will supply. [I do not mean the 
stupid and lazy practice of throwing every vegetable 
into about the same quantity of boiling water, with- 
out regard to its age and condition.] Celery too can 
sometimes improve a dinner much more decidedly in 
its natural state, with the cheese, than when it is 
braised in gravy, although both ways have their 
merits. A perfectly grown cauliflower is better plain 
than dressed, when it accompanies an entree or joint 



VEGETABLES 169 

which boasts a good sauce or gravy. And as for 
potatoes, if I were asked to recall the occasions on 
which I have enjoyed them most, I should pick out 
two without hesitation. The first was at a tiny 
cottage where small new potatoes were taken straight 
out of the ground, plainly boiled, and served with 
nothing but a little butter. The second occasion 
was when I lunched one day from four older but 
sound potatoes baked not too quickly in the oven. 
With these I did not even eat butter. Salt was the 
only extra, although it would be uncandid to conceal 
the fact that half-a-bottle of good St EmiHon was 
emptied at the same time. 



I do not propose in this chapter, any more than in 
the other chapters, to repeat what every cook knows 
or can easily learn from the books already in her 
possession. So I will lead out with instructions for 
preparing a vegetable which is too much neglected in 
England, although it is tasty and cheap. I speak of 
the red cabbage. This vegetable is seldom found in 
England except as a pickle ; and, even as a pickle, it 
is more often than not eaten in a tough and indigestible 
state. Having bought a sound and fresh red cabbage, 
I tear off and throw away the soiled and untidy out- 
side leaves, exposing a firm and purple orb. With a 
sharp long knife I cut this orb into two equal halves. 
These halves when laid open are a pretty sight, the 
white hearts and the purple crinklings of the close- 
set leaves contrasting bravely. It is safer to purify 
the halves in salted water in the ordinary way, al- 
though the close growth of the outside leaves usually 



170 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

protects the cabbage from vermin. The next stage 
is to cut out the tougher parts of the heart, where the 
stalk was growing into the cabbage. Then, with the 
same sharp knife, one cuts the cabbage into large thin 
slices. Two large Spanish onions are freed from their 
outside skins and are sliced up in the same way. 
Next, some cooking apples, of the same total bulk 
as the onions, must be peeled and cored and cut up into 
thin pieces. Meanwhile a casserole or stewpan should 
have been placed over a very gentle heat, with a lump 
of butter in it. Over the melted butter one gently 
piles up the slices of cabbage and onion and apple, 
moistening the whole with a good spoonful of vinegar 
and a small tumblerful of cheap red wine. If there 
is claret or Burgundy in the house which has been open 
a day too long, it can be used with the cabbage, and if 
it has begun to go slightly sour the quantity of 
vinegar will be lessened. A little brown sugar, some 
pepper and a little salt are to be added. The lid is 
placed tightly on the vessel and the cooking goes on 
for four or five hours, as slowly as possible. Now 
and again the contents of the pan should be turned 
over with a wooden spoon so that the butter is equally 
distributed. When the dish is ready, the onions and 
apples and cabbage will be found blended together 
in such a way that the apple and onion will hardly be 
recognised, while the cabbage will taste mild and 
refined. I serve this dish with very thin slices from 
a hot ham or from a baked piece of bacon, or with 
sausages on a cold day. When one can get into touch 
with a butcher who makes beef sausages really well, 
they go finely with this dish of red cabbage, although 
they are much cheaper than good pork sausages. If 



VEGETABLES 171 

the cabbage is not all eaten at one meal — and I ought 
to say that the recipe just given will yield several 
pounds' weight — it can be kept until the next day, as 
it is greatly improved by being warmed up once or 
twice. Indeed I have warmed up red cabbage five 
days running, and it got better every day. Some 
people dislike this dish of red cabbage at first, and a 
few dishke it to the end ; but those who acquire a 
taste for it sometimes become slaves to it and eat it 
too often, thus running the risk of getting tired of a 
dish which is delightful as a change though unsuitable 
as daily fare. 

By using a firm white cabbage and white wine, 
instead of a red cabbage and red wine, the foregoing 
recipe can be used for a less tasty but more soberly 
coloured dish. In Denmark one often meets with 
something between the two, the principal ingredient 
being the darker coloured greens stewed in red wine. 



Cabbages of the pale varieties lend themselves to 
many uses over and above plain boiling. You should 
study, in your bigger books, the famous dish called 
Perdrix aux Choux and apply it to such game-birds 
as are cheap and suitable. And you should take a 
pride in making good cabbage soup. And do not 
forget the cold slaw mentioned in my chapter on 
Salads. 

Cabbages, boiled and salted, were prescribed by 
Hippocrates to cure colic ; and many ancient physi- 
cians regarded it as a remedy against all kinds of ills, 



172 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

from paralysis to the drink habit. I believe they used 
red cabbage more than the other kinds. 



Onions are mentioned over and over again in these 
pages. Indeed, if Divine Providence should be 
pleased to grant me a long enough life, I shall hope 
to write the Book of the Onion. It requires courage 
to make such an announcement, because many gross 
and selfish persons have failed to restrain themselves 
from munching raw or pickled onions until, in the 
language of Dr Thudichum, they become " bearers 
of exhalations objectionable to polite society." The 
grossness of low persons is not, however, a valid argu- 
ment against the right employment of the foods which 
they abuse. It would disgust an Englishman to see 
an Eskimo greedily devouring raw fat meat, but it 
does not follow that the disgusted Englishman ought 
to turn vegetarian for the rest of his life. A drunken 
navvy is an ugly and pitiable sight, but a temperate 
man is still justified in drinking a glass of young 
Moselle. I shall therefore make no more apologies 
for the onion. On the contrary, I should like to 
trumpet its virtues. One of the most exalted ladies in 
the United Kingdom, whose youthful bloom is envied 
by professional beauties twenty years her junior, 
makes a point of eating a boiled onion every night just 
before going to bed. I know a high dignitary of the 
Church whose face after a long life of worries is as 
fresh as a yeoman's because no day of his life passes 
without a dish of onions. Not that onions are re- 
markably nutritious. But nutrition is not every- 
thing. Onions contribute to the system certain salts 



VEGETABLES 173 

and other elements of inestimable value. It used to 
be said that these elements dispelled fatigue after long 
marching or hard riding. It was also believed that 
onion soup would soon restore the equilibrium of a 
man who had drunk too much. I have no direct 
experience on these points, but I am persuaded that 
an onion is a good gift from heaven. 

The large onions from Spain and Portugal are best 
for use as an out-and-out vegetable, while the small 
round onions should be used in such entrees as a 
Poulet en Casserole. To prepare an ordinary dish of 
boiled onions, cut off the roots and tops of some 
Portuguese or Spanish specimens, remove the dark 
skin, and blanch them. Blanching is effected by 
putting the onions in a saucepan of cold water, and 
bringing the water to the boil. This water is thrown 
away, and the onions, after being rinsed, are laid in a 
panful of salted water which has just reached boiling- 
point. If they are very large they ought to be cut in 
halves before blanching. They must be boiled in the 
second water for two hours, or a little less if they are 
small. By pricking them with a fork it is easy to 
know when they are tender. It is necessary to drain 
them well and sometimes even to put them back in 
the empty saucepan and let them dry by the side of 
the fire. They can be eaten with a lump of butter 
and plenty of pepper and salt, or with white or brown 
sauce, or with hot finely minced meat. 

Onions stewed in good stock make a vegetable 
entree worth eating. The cook boils them quickly 
in salted water for about five minutes, then drains them 
in cold water. They are next laid in the pan with a 
pint or so of dark stock and about an ounce of beef 



174 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

dripping or butter. Like plain boiled onions, they 
must cook for about two hours, stewing slowly by the 
side of the fire. Some cooks take a little cornflour 
and make it into a smooth paste with some tomato 
sauce, stirring the paste into the stock a few minutes 
before the onions are to be put on the table. Of 
course the stock is poured over the onions and served 
with them. 

I have often stewed onions in one water only and 
have found that, while retaining their goodness, they 
lose their strong smell as much as if they had been 
blanched. For example, I have broken up good 
onions and have gradually reduced them in good 
white sauce almost to a cream. By rubbing the 
puree through a sieve I have made it perfectly smooth 
and have completed the illusion by adding a table - 
spoonful or two of fresh cream from the dairy. When 
this puree of onions is carefully made (either blanched 
or unblanched) it will be fairly stiff and has a hand- 
some appearance. In the company of a French 
gourmet I have eaten it spread on toast, but most 
people would prefer it along with a well-grilled chump 
chop or a small tender steak. 



Although — or because — potatoes are eaten nearly 
every day in the year by British people, I shall not 
say much about them. Housekeepers should be 
reminded not to peel them too deeply, as careless 
peeling wastes not only the body of the potato but the 
best of its soul. In performing the very common 
action of boiling potatoes, we should be careful to 
see that the boiling is fast . I have known many a poor 



VEGETABLES 175 

Irish charwoman beat a highly paid English cook at 
boiling potatoes, simply because she knows this secret 
by instinct. We must also try to learn the gauging 
of salt for varying quantities and qualities of potatoes. 
A little boy defined salt as " the stuff that makes the 
potatoes taste nasty when your mother forgets to put 
any in." Salt omitted in the boiling cannot be re- 
placed by simply sprinkling dry salt on the potato after 
serving. On the other hand, an excess of salt cannot 
possibly be taken out. These are obvious truths but 
they are too often ignored. 

Steamed potatoes retain the nutriment better than 
boiled potatoes. They should be sprinkled with salt 
and steamed in an ordinary steamer placed at the top 
of a saucepan and covered with the saucepan lid. 
The water must boil fast, so as to generate plenty of 
steam. 

When you have an excess of good dripping in the 
house, wash and brush and peel some potatoes and 
boil them for about ten minutes in enough slightly 
salted boihng water to cover them. Drain them, 
powder them all over with fine flour, and lay them 
carefully on some melted dripping in a baking-tin. 
In an oven that is not too hot, bake them till they 
show a handsome brown colour. To ensure their 
being cooked right through, turn them over once or 
twice during the half-hour or so of their stay in the 
oven. Do not let them come to the table greasy. 

Everybody likes a potato in the jacket — or, as the 
French say, en robe de ckamhre. I have cooked 
potatoes of all ages and sizes in this way, from the 
tiny new potato no bigger than a marble to the giant 
which is just passing out of its prime. Of course the 



176 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

coats must be well cleaned and all specks and eyes 
must be nipped out. One method is to put them in 
a pan with enough salted boiling water to cover them, 
to replace the pan lid, to bring the potatoes to the 
boil and then to let them simmer for nearly half- 
an-hour, until the pushing in of a skewer shows that 
they are cooked. The water is poured away, and the 
potatoes are drained through a hot colander. They 
are placed once more in the pan, with a folded towel 
over them instead of the lid, and are set beside the 
fire so that the towel can absorb any remaining mois- 
ture. Another way (which I prefer) is to clean the 
skins and then make the potatoes perfectly dry. 
Next, the skins are pricked and the potatoes are put 
into a moderate oven until they are cooked right 
through. This sounds so simple that a novice will 
wonder how any cook could carry out the process 
wrongly. Yet I have seen more failures than suc- 
cesses. For some reason, many cooks lay the potatoes 
on the lowest sheet or grid of the gas-oven, and they 
sometimes leave the potatoes baking as long as the 
big joint which they are to accompany. The result 
is that the potatoes come out with toughened skins 
and sodden insides. It is best to place the potatoes 
on an upper shelf and to cook them for not much 
more than an hour. The skin ought to be thinner 
than the shell of a hard-boiled egg and ought to come 
off quite as easily, while the potato itself should be 
delightfully mealy right through. 

Fried potatoes must be fried in the true way — that 
is, in the bath of fat. Some people fail with them 
because they do not dry them thoroughly before im- 
mersing them and do not drain them when they come 



VEGETABLES 177 

out of the bath. It costs no more to cut them up, 
before frying them, into ribbons or straws or little 
rods like matches. Many cooks, after frying potatoes 
in these pretty forms, put them into an air-tight box 
and keep them for warming up when they are required ; 
but I have never been able to congratulate them upon 
their achievement. 

When you have some cooked potatoes left over, you 
may cut them in slices a quarter of an inch thick and 
brown them on both sides in hot butter or good hot 
dripping. By shaking the pan and tossing them until 
they jrmip you obtain the true pommes sautees (of 
course, from the French sauter, meaning " to jiunp ") 
which are one of the chief dehghts of home cookery 
and one of the chief terrors of the cheap little restaur- 
ant. By the way, the process in this paragraph 
should be contrasted with that described in the para- 
graph preceding it as illustrating the difference be- 
tween true frying and mere browning. 

I shall pass over the forty or fifty more famihar 
ways of treating potatoes as explained in the ordinary 
cookery-books, and shall give only one more potato 
hint which can be applied economically in. all kinds 
of different circumstances. In the best restaurants 
of all countries there is a dish, unknown to the nine- 
teenth century, called a Filet de Sole Otero. To make 
it properly one must have a Dover sole, and shrimps 
and truffles, and Parmesan cheese and butter on a 
rather expensive scale ; so I will give the recipe only 
in so far as it can be used with cheaper fillings. Pick 
out four large and handsome potatoes which will lie 
on their sides without wobbhng. Bake them as 
. directed in the last paragraph but three, but let the 

M 



178 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

skins become a little tougher than I have recom- 
mended for an ordinary baked potato. Cut a neat 
oval in the topmost side of each potato and carefully 
scoop out as much of the inside as you can take away 
without allowing the skin to break or collapse. Mash 
up the insides which you have removed and give them 
a good seasoning of pepper and salt and butter. Now 
begin to refill the skins with the broken potato. After 
putting in a small layer, add any suitable morsels of 
hot fish, or well-stewed kidneys cut up small, or any- 
thing else that will not be difficult to get out again 
when the dish is eaten. Put in more of the seasoned 
potato. If you have some good and suitable sauce — 
Sauce Mornay, for instance — pour it in. When the 
potato is full, it is a good thing to sprinkle a little 
grated cheese on the top and to brown it under a 
salamandre or under the deflecting griller of the gas- 
stove. This " Otero " potato can be quite a cheap 
little luxury, and it gives great pleasure to those who 
have never seen it before. I once made it for some 
children and delighted them greatly by sending the 
potatoes to the table with a sprig of holly upright in 
the first, a cutting from a fir-tree in the second, a 
tiny spray of bramble leaves of magnificent autumnal 
hues in the third, and a chrysanthemum in the fourth. 
The children had been in delicate health and were 
known to have wretched appetites, but they ate their 
potatoes down to the skins. 



Sea-kale is dearer than potatoes, but you buy it in 
smaller quantities, and you ought, when it is at its 
best, to include it in your menus. A famous cook 



VEGETABLES 179 

serves it with Sauce Mornay, but it is better plain 
(not over-boiled) with hot butter. 



Salsify, either fried or saute or a la creme, makes a 
dish good enough to be eaten by itself. As there are 
still many men and women in England who have 
never tasted this racy vegetable, its appearance on 
the table arouses interest and gives you a chance of 
greater simplicity in the rest of the dinner. 



That very ancient vegetable, the leek, ought to be 
cultivated more abundantly in England now that we 
are determined to raise more of our own food supplies. 
It is in season throughout the months when the kitchen 
most needs this kind of thing. The Egyptians wor- 
shiped the leek as a divinity. Some people say that 
it is a fine plant for the liver, and that it is also valu- 
able in diseases of the chest. As the leek is milder 
than the onion, nobody can reasonably object to it 
when it is properly cooked. The oldest recipe I can 
find directs us to take the mildest leeks we can get, 
to cover them with young cabbage leaves, and to 
cook them under the hot embers, serving them in a 
dish with gravy, oil and ^vine. I do not expect every 
reader of this book to rise straight up and hunt for 
cabbage leaves ; indeed I am not sanguine that many 
people will be willing to make experiments with leek 
cookery in any direction. Here, however, are some 
instructions for the treatment of leeks in a manner 
which seems unknown in England. I have the recipe 
from a Frenchman who told me that the dish was 



i8o HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

called a Flamiche. He said that it was a special dish 
of the north, but I could not find out whether he meant 
the north of France or the north of Europe, and it is 
only since beginning to write this book that I have 
traced it in the old cuisine of Picardy. 

Take four or five good leeks and cut them into 
dice the night before you want the Flamiche. Lay 
them in salted water, throw in a few drops of vinegar, 
and leave them to blanch. Next day, prepare a 
paste as for " short crust." Put into a casserole a 
good ounce of butter and a dessertspoonful of flour. 
Let the flour take a good colour ; add less than a 
third of a pint of boiling milk. Chop up the blanched 
dice of leeks finely, put them in the casserole and let 
them cook with the milk and butter and flour for 
about thirty minutes. You will find that the cooking 
reduces the liquid, but you must have ready the yolk 
of an egg with which to bind the mixture. Roll out 
the paste to the thickness of a quarter of an inch, lay 
it in a shallow tin, leaving plenty of overlap, pour the 
cooked leeks in the midst, and fold the paste over, 
pinching the sides together. Bake it in the oven as 
you would an apple turnover. This Flamiche is a 
boon to housekeepers in families where Friday is 
religiously observed. It is best hot. 

Trimmed leeks, which have been split down the 
middle and soaked in cold water and a little vinegar 
for about half-an-hour, are drained and cut up and 
washed in cold water and transferred to a glazed 
casserole in which there is enough stock to cover them. 
With the lid on, a gentle stewing continues until the 
stock has almost all disappeared. The result is a 
dish of stewed leeks needing nothing more than salt 



VEGETABLES i8i 

and pepper, with a piece of butter almost at the 
moment of serving. 



Young French beans, when served with cutlets or 
roast meat, are best in the plain old English way. 
This vegetable, however, is so good that it should not 
always be considered a mere accompaniment to some- 
thing else. Boiled and drained and then returned to 
the saucepan, in which some butter has been melted, 
French beans need only a seasoning of pepper and 
salt, with perhaps a little lemon juice and chopped 
parsley, to become a vegetable entree of the best kind. 
For a change, this recipe may be modified by taking 
the beans out of the water while they are still not 
quite tender. They are then to be drained and put 
into a pan containing some melted butter. Flour is 
sprinkled over them — a dessertspoonful of flour to a 
pound of beans — and the pan is moved briskly about 
over the fire so as to toss the contents. About a 
quarter of a pint of milk is poured in and the beans 
are gently simmered until they are quite tender. 
Some people beat up the yolk of an egg with a little 
water and lemon juice and mix it well with the beans 
at the last moment. 



While I do not wish to scold Englishwomen unreason- 
ably, I cannot help telling a little story about the tasty 
and interesting dish known in French as Haricots 
verts panaches aux flageolets. I know a lady who met 
with this delicacy in tins at the shop of a French 
grocer in Soho, named Barron. She was delighted 



i82 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

with it and, although the price was high, it was to be 
seen on her table, even when fresh beans were in full 
season. Suddenly it disappeared from her menus. 
On my asking for the explanation I was told that 
Madam Barron had given up business and closed her 
shop, and that no other French grocer in London 
kept the same brand. This story is characteristic 
of the want of analytical faculty and resourcefulness 
which partly account for the monotony of English 
diet. Such haricots verts panaches make a delightful 
dish, but they are nothing more than French beans 
cooked with flageolets. I admit that fresh flageolets 
are rather difficult to meet with in England, but the 
dried kind can be bought in hundreds of shops at 
from sevenpence to ninepence a pound. In its native 
state, the flageolet is simply a little green kidney bean 
taken out of its pod in early childhood. Of course 
the dried ones must be soaked in water overnight. 
As the lady I have mentioned was in love with the 
tinned delicacy, I will base my recipe on the assump- 
tion that only tinned and dry materials are available. 
Having soaked some dried flageolets overnight, put 
them into a saucepan with enough cold water to cover 
them and bring the water to boiling-point. Some 
herbs and an onion will improve them. Let them 
cook until they are quite soft and then drain them, 
at the same time clearing away all traces of the herbs 
and the onion. While they are cooking, open a tin 
of good haricots verts, rinse them, and finally mix them 
with the finished flageolets. Put the mixture in a 
pan containing melted butter and complete the cook- 
ing on the lines of the two foregoing recipes, either 
with or without milk and flour and yolk of e^^, accord- 



VEGETABLES 183 

ing to your taste. Working along these lines, a dish 
of haricots verts panaches aux flageolets will cost much 
less than the proprietary packings and will taste far 
better. 



Some earnest persons, who have heard that this 
book is being written, are anxious that great pro- 
minence shall be given to dried peas. They are mostly 
men without palates, who believe every word of the 
advertisements which state that Messrs Growem and 
Sellem's dried peas are in every respect equal to young 
peas in June. I should rejoice with great joy if this 
were true. Unhappily, dried peas in January are 
certainly not as good as new peas in May. I will 
give the best directions I can for the use of dried peas, 
but the reader must not expect a superfine result. 
Soak a pint of peas overnight. Drain them, and 
rinse them in a colander under the cold-water tap. 
Pour them into a saucepan with enough cold water 
to cover them, and bring them to the boil. Add to the 
water some herbs and an onion cut into pieces. Cook 
the peas till they are tender. Should the water boil 
away too soon, add some more from a kettle. Drain 
the peas when they are tender, taking away the onion 
and herbs. Replace them in the saucepan with 
about two ounces of butter, a teaspoonful of sugar, 
and a seasoning of pepper and salt. If you have 
some really good stock, add about half-a-teacupful. 
Leave them on the fire just long enough for 
the extra ingredients to come well together and 
then serve the peas very hot. Eat them in a 
thankful spirit, remembering that better Christians 



i84 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

than yourself have sustained life on worse food 
than this. 

Fresh peas are so good that the simpler the 
cooking the better. As they grow older, they 
can be prepared with shreds of lettuce, with 
spring onions, and even with thin slices of tender 
carrots. 

Half-way between fresh peas and dried peas we have 
peas preserved in tins. The very cheap brands, 
especially those sold by oilmen and cut-price grocers, 
should not be touched with a long pole. Some of the 
cheap Belgian marrowfat peas in tins are much more 
satisfactory than smaller and finer-looking peas at 
higher prices. But, whatever kind you buy, never 
warm them in the tin. As certain tinned foods bear 
labels instructing you to stand the tin in hot water 
before opening it, some housewives follow this course 
with tinned peas. They must not do so any more. 
The peas must be poured into a strainer and thor- 
oughly rinsed with boiling water. It follows that, 
after such treatment, they cannot make supremely 
fine eating, but it is better to lose a little flavour than 
to take some poison into your system. When I find 
myself obliged to use tinned peas, I cleanse them and 
then warm them in the upper part of a double pan, 
with a sprig of mint if I can get it, and some sugar 
atnd butter and salt. I cook them only until they 
are quite hot — that is to say, for two or three 
minutes. 

Finding herself with a few scraps won from the 
remains of a cold chicken, and having in the house 
enough " short crust " paste to line a few pat tie-pans, 
a clever cook could make novel tartlets of peas and 



VEGETABLES 185 

chicken to take the place of a more expensive vol-au- 
vent. 



When we come to the carrot we are on shaky ground. 
According to a cookery-book published only a few 
months ago by a writer of repute, Miss Florence B. 
Jack, the carrot is one of the most useful and most 
nourishing of vegetables, although it is not one which 
is particularly easy of digestion. It is valuable both 
for flavouring purposes in soups and stews, and also 
for serving as a separate vegetable. It is more nour- 
ishing than the turnip, is rich in both starch and 
sugar, and contains many valuable mineral salts. 
On the other hand Dr Thudichum, who was a learned 
man in spite of his pedantry, wrote : " The most 
singular feature in the history of carrots is that, al- 
though they are eaten by man in various forms, 
stewed, boiled, as puree in soups and in ragouts, and 
introduced into most bouillons, consommes, braises, 
mirepoix, etc., yet they are perfectly indigestible, and 
pass through the alimentary canal almost in the same 
shape as that in which they have left the mouth after 
having been chewed. Notwithstanding their in- 
digestibility, they are not known to cause any digestive 
derangement. The great affection which cooks and 
diners have for carrots can only be explained by their 
colour, which makes an impression on the eye, and 
their flavour and sweetness, which speak to the 
palate." 

I think that Dr Thudichum was wrong. And I do 
not agree with another writer who holds that the 
principal use of a carrot is to be grated fine and used 



i86 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

as a dressing for burns or chapped skin. All the same, 
a diet of carrots and nothing else would not produce a 
race of heroes. 

Carottes h la crfeme may be considered carrots at 
their best. A famous French cook prescribes large 
and tender carrots to this end, but it is better to use 
small new carrots if possible. Blanch them for a 
few minutes in salted water, smUez them in butter on 
a slow fire, season them, moisten them with some stock, 
and, when they are half cooked, add some parsley and 
a little sugar if the carrots when raw seemed to have 
less than their proper sweetness. Give them finally 
a binding of yolk of egg mixed with a little cream, or 
with butter and flour well worked together, and serve 
them at once. 

Carrots in the Flemish fashion should also be new. 
If they are large they should be cut in slices, but before 
this is done they must be blanched in boihng water 
for about five minutes and rinsed in cold water. The 
skin can easily be rubbed off with a cloth. English 
servants too often remove the best part of the carrot 
by peeling it with a knife. Of course the top and the 
tail are cut off and thrown away. For a pound of 
carrots you will require just enough boiling water to 
cover them, along with an ounce of butter, half-a-tea- 
spoonful of sugar and the same quantity of salt. The 
carrots must be simmered, with the Hd on the casserole, 
until they are quite tender. If you have not made 
the mistake of giving them more than the minimum 
of water, you will be well on the way towards success. 
Work together some chopped parsley with the yolk 
of an egg and as much cream as you can spare and 
add it to the carrots. Stir the mixture until it 



VEGETABLES 187 

thickens. The heat must be very gentle and the 
carrots must not come to the boil on any account. 



What has been said about carrots can easily be 
modified by the intelligent reader to meet the case of 
turnips, so long as it is remembered that the addition 
of salt toughens turnips and takes away their colour. 
The ordinary English cookery-books give directions 
for making mashed turnips or purees of turnips, of 
both colours. At their best the yellow turnips can 
yield a most useful mash. Great care should be 
taken to get rid of the water. Draining through the 
colander is not sufficient and the vegetable should be 
dried for a few minutes in the pan. 

Turnip tops are useful while they are young. At 
their very youngest they are dehcate enough to use 
in salads. 



Although I have set out to preach economy, I hope 
that no reader will go too far in trying to use nearly 
every leaf of her Brussels sprouts. Some cooks merely 
remove those leaves which are actually diseased, and, 
after cleansing the sprouts in salted water, proceed to 
boil them to death and to serve them discoloured and 
sodden like baby cabbages that have been racketing 
about all night. The proper way is to trim them until 
only the firm and hard part remains, which should be 
like a handsome, closely grown miniature cabbage, 
about the size of a walnut. They must be put into 
salted boihng water, or, better still, in a perforated 
steamer over boiling water, and cooked until, without 



i88 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

losing their firmness, they have become tender. Half- 
an-hour of boiling or steaming will generally be 
enough. If they are to be eaten with meat and gravy, 
they will be simply drained dry and served hot. If, 
however, they are required to accompany some 
rather dry meat, or to be eaten as a separate dish, you 
must put them back into the saucepan, having first 
melted therein one ounce of butter to every pound of 
sprouts. The butter must be very hot. The pan is 
kept by the side of the fire or over the smallest gas-jet 
and is shaken now and then during six or seven 
minutes. The saucepan remains uncovered from the 
beginning to the end of these operations, even during 
the first boihng. If you should boil the sprouts in a 
closed saucepan they would not keep their pleasant 
colour. 

If Brussels sprouts are lifted out of the pan or 
steamer before they are quite tender, and are dried 
with a cloth and dusted over with salted and peppered 
flour, they can be fried. Each sprout must be dipped 
in a mixture of egg and breadcrumb till it is coated 
all over, and the frying must be true frying in boiling 
fat at least two inches deep. As always with fried 
tit-bits, the sprouts must be drained on paper and not 
a moment must be wasted in piling them on a very hot 
dish and sending them straight to the table. 



One of the most remarkable of vegetables is the 
cauliflower. It was probably unknown in England 
until after the death of Oliver Cromwell. When I 
see some of the overboiled messes into which many 
cooks transform it, I wish that they had lived in the 



VEGETABLES 189 

Commonwealth's dour and cauliflowerless days. A 
cauliflower can be digested by invalids and yet it is 
full of points for the most enterprising gourmet. 
White and compact heads should be looked out for, as 
the yellowy or greeny specimens are much inferior. 

Cut away the thick part of the stalk, taking care, 
however, that you do not risk the falling asunder of 
the branches. Strip away all the green leaves except 
the innermost and very delicate-looking curls of green. 
Let the cauliflower lie for at least half-an-hour in cold 
water in which you have mixed a little vinegar. This 
is to bring out the insects and other vermin. [You 
cannot be too careful on this point. In a French 
restaurant which was reputed to be good, I once 
passed through an experience which turned me 
against cauliflowers for many years.] Take the 
cauliflower out of its bath and rinse it well. Lay it in 
a steamer over a good volume of steam and cook it 
until it is tender. Or you can boil the cauliflower, in 
which case you will keep the water to make a soup — 
for example, the Soubise described in the chapter on 
Soups. Take great pains to guard against over- 
cooking. A cauliflower must never become a mush. 
It is hard to find a word in English to describe the 
ideal in this respect. The French use the word 
croquant, which suggests that the teeth encounter a 
pleasant little resistance, so that the cauliflower is 
crunched rather than bolted. 

Some people pour their sauces over the cauliflower. 
This should only be done when the cauliflower is of 
bad colour or shape. It looks best served naturally, 
with the Hollandaise or other sauce in a separate 
vessel. 



igo HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

Your cookery-book ought to give you at least a 
dozen ways of dressing cauliflowers. They can be 
done as fritters, or curried, or baked, or souffl6, or 
saut6 in little sprigs. One good and unfamiliar 
French method, although it sacrifices the desirable 
firmness and prettiness of the sprigs, is to work a well- 
steamed cauliflower through a sieve so as to get a 
puree, and to add to this two eggs, some thick cream, 
about an ounce of butter melted in a cup, and some 
pepper and salt. The mixture is turned into a 
buttered mould and is cooked in a bain-marie. Or 
breadcrumbs and stock may be thickened in a pan 
over the fire, butter and well-broken cauliflower being 
afterwards mixed well with them. After the mixing, 
the pan must be taken away from the fire and the 
yolk of an egg stirred in, with pepper and salt. A 
plain cake-tin, greased and coated nicely with bread- 
crumbs, should be standing ready. Froth up the 
white of the egg and add it to the mixture. Pour 
everything into the mould and bake it in a moderately 
hot oven. This kind of baking is best done by stand- 
ing the cake-tin in a larger tin containing hot water. 
After about half-an-hour's baking you will have what 
the French call a cauliflower loaf. The egg will make 
it very light and tempting to an invalid. It can be 
served with or without sauce. 

For days of abstinence, or as a comfortable extra 
dish on a day when you are serving very little meat, it 
is hard to improve upon a good Choufleur au Gratin. 
Ha\ang boiled a good cauliflower, drain it well, break 
it into a number of sprigs, arrange these in a fireproof 
dish, sprinkle over them some grated cheese — it is 
better to use half Parmesan and half Gruy^re — and 



VEGETABLES 191 

some Sauce Bechamel. Powder again with grated 
cheese and some grated dry bread, pour some newly 
melted butter over the whole and make haste to 
gratiner the mixture under a deflector. This is a good 
method. Perhaps, however, it is more likely to suc- 
ceed in a French than in an English kitchen, so I will 
give an alternative. Put the cauliflower (not over- 
boiled) in a buttered fireproof dish and pour newly 
melted butter over the pieces. Sprinkle the mixed 
grated cheese, taking care that it is evenly distributed. 
Pour on more of the butter. Sprinkle the finest 
raspings or crumbs of bread that you can get, all over, 
again taking care that the distribution is even. Again 
moisten with a little butter all over. Put the dish in 
the oven until the contents begin to show a shght 
browning and serve in the same fireproof dish. Cer- 
tain Enghsh cooks proceed on almost entirely different 
lines, using water and flour and cream, but I think my 
two ways are better. 



Crosnes, or Japanese artichokes, are getting cheaper 
in England every year, as we have learned that we can 
grow them easily and well. In my own tiny garden 
I once planted a handful in an idle moment, and was 
rewarded by getting a dishful of poetical little crosnes, 
with all the lustre of mother-of-pearl. Taken straight 
out of the ground, they have a better taste and a more 
delicate appearance than when they are bought in 
shops. As this is not exactly an economical vegetable, 
I never use it with a lavish hand. A few crosnes a la 
crime will give distinction to otherwise commonplace 
grillades. Or they can be served ^auVes au beurre. 



192 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

They should be well washed in warm water to free 
them from any traces of soil and plunged into boiling 
water. Here the handy word croquant which I had to 
use in speaking of cauliflowers will come to our help. 
The boiling of crosnes must not go so far as to take 
away their croquant quality. After they are well 
drained, they can be laid in white sauce made with 
cream or milk and butter, warmed thoroughly and 
served as a separate dish. 



Spinach is easier to digest than Brussels sprouts and 
cabbages, except when it is old. Most people prefer 
to eat it only when it has been rubbed down into a 
puree and enriched with butter or cream. A fair trial 
will convince most palates that spinach is better "en 
branches." Gouffe and other French writers prefer 
to speak of this style as Epinards ^ I'Anglaise, by 
which they intend a rap at our Enghsh inelegance. 
To cook it in this way, we must wash our spinach well 
in order to get rid of the grits, and we must free it 
from the coarser stalks and ribs. We ought to boil 
it in a very small quantity of salted water until it is 
tender, and serve it very hot, without mincing or 
sieving, with a piece of butter on top. I have tasted 
spinach made up into a kind of loaf or cake, but the 
recipe was an extravagant one, requiring four eggs as 
well as butter and creajn, and the result was only 
moderately good. 



Sorrel may be cooked on the lines of spinach, or, 
better still, you can gather it in the course of your 



VEGETABLES 193 

country walks and mix it with the spinach, letting the 
spinach predominate if possible. A good way is to 
wash both vegetables thoroughly ; to cook them in a 
saucepan with quite a small quantity of salted water ; 
to drain the cooked leaves and dry them well ; to 
chop them up fine ; to put them into a pan with some 
melting butter and stir the mixture over the fire till 
they seem to have become perfectly free from moisture ; 
to work in a dusting of nutmeg, a dusting of salt, an 
eggspoonful of sugar, a dusting of flour and, if you can 
spare it, some cream, and to let this final mixture 
simmer for twelve or fifteen minutes. This cream of 
sorrel and spinach should be eaten with little fingers 
of toast, like almost all soft preparations. 



Cucumbers have been discussed in the chapter on 
hors d'oeuvre. I should like to point out, however, 
that they are sometimes to be bought large and cheap. 
When this happens, it is a good thing to try them 
fried, or as a soup, or k la cr^me, or stuffed. A cooked 
cucumber is much more easily digested than a cu- 
cumber eaten raw. The seeds must always be scooped 
out : and if this can be done before the vegetable is 
cooked so much the better. To fry them you will boil 
drums of cucumber, having added a little salt and 
vinegar to the water ; you will take them out after 
about ten minutes and rinse them in cold water ; you 
will dry them in a napkin and give them a thin under 
garment of flour and salt and pepper and an overcoat 
of egg and breadcrumb. The frying must be done 
in the deep bath of boiling fat. 

Or, having boiled and drained them, you can stew 

N 



194 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

the pieces of cucumber in stock or gravy. As for the 
stuffed cucumbers, these should not be the scraggy 
kind, curved Hke a bow, but should be short and 
thick. You take off the skin and boil the whole of the 
flayed cucumber in a fish-kettle or other long vessel for 
ten minutes. Then you lay it open lengthways and 
clear out the seeds. This being a watery vegetable, 
you dry it in a warm napkin. In the long trough 
which formerly held the seeds, you press a stuffing 
made according to what you have found in your 
pantry. The stuffing is better made of dark than of 
light coloured meats and should be as flavoury as 
possible. The first time I stuffed a cucumber there 
was nothing at hand but some potted beef and some 
tomato catsup and some breadcrumbs, but the out- 
come was not a disgrace. After filling the troughs, 
there is a choice of two methods. Some people do not 
rejoin the two halves but lay them in a fireproof dish 
well buttered and bake the two long pieces side by side, 
first putting breadcrumbs and a little butter all along 
the upper surfaces. Others press the two halves 
together and tie them with a tape in two places. 
Then they lay the cucumbers in a tin containing 
some stock. They cover the tin and put it in a 
moderate oven, occasionally taking it out and basting 
the cucumber with the stock. They cut and remove 
the tapes at the last minute and pour a good brown 
sauce over the cucumber. 

If you have the right tool for worming out the seeds 
without cutting the cucumber open, you can intro- 
duce the stuffing after the fashion of larding ; but 
in small kitchens it is better not to attempt too 
much. 



VEGETABLES 195 

Tomatoes have established themselves so firmly in 
all Enghsh households that there is no need to say 
much about them. When you possess some beauti- 
fully ripe and sound and well-shaped tomatoes, it is 
best to put them on the table in all their handsomeness 
of form and colour. They can be eaten raw, like 
pieces of fruit, or they can be peeled at the table and 
sliced up with oil and vinegar and pepper and salt. 
Tomatoes which are not fully ripe can be sliced and 
fried, the slices having been coated with batter, or 
with flour, pepper and salt first, and egg and bread- 
crumb afterwards. A handsome little entree is 
made by cutting the tops very neatly off some large 
and firm tomatoes and scooping out the pulp, after- 
wards filling them up with a meat stuffing. The 
pulp, freed from seeds, is worked into the stufiing so 
that nothing is lost. Care must be taken at all stages 
to avoid breaking the tomatoes. They are to be 
baked, in a buttered fireproof dish, for a quarter of 
an hour in a moderate oven. Some cooks sprinkle 
breadcrumbs on the tops of the tomatoes, adding a 
little butter and some grated cheese almost at the last 
moment, and finish off this entree under a deflector 
or salamandre. 

Although we ought to keep away from tinned vege- 
tables as much as possible, I must admit that tinned 
tomatoes from a good shop are an enormous help 
to a cook in a small house. The peeled tomatoes 
are wonderful value for the small sum they cost. I 
have often, in an emergency, thanked heaven and 
the Italian people for this boon. A tin of tomatoes 
lends itself to the making of tomato soup in at least 
half-a-dozen good ways, and any resourceful person 



196 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

can improvise a sauce for fish or entrees when a 
tin of tomatoes is at hand. Of course nothing should 
be left in the tin after it is opened. Any surplus 
should be kept in an earthenware vessel. 

Tinned tomatoes, merely peppered and salted and 
warmed up with a good piece of butter in a fireproof 
dish, are not to be despised. 



Speaking broadly and generally, cold remnants of 
vegetables are to be treated with respect. A tidy 
housewife, with a passion for clearing up, may be 
inclined to throw away the single sprig of cauli- 
flower, the half-ounce of mashed potato, the dozen 
or so of French beans which come back from the 
table. She must do nothing of the kind. Let her 
once form the habit of modifying her cookery accord- 
ing to the oddments in her pantry and she will find 
herself saving money and gaining efficiency every 
day. What will not do for hors d'ceuvre may do for 
soup, and what will not do for soup may add not 
only to the bulk but to the charm of a stew or a 
salad or a savoury. And let it be remembered 
that potatoes are not the only cold vegetables which 
can be fried. 



I know a housewife who is honestly bent on thrift. 
Yet her kitchen costs her far too much, simply because 
she lacks the right point of view towards vegetables. 
At her house, one will find a delicious leg of lamb cost- 
ing a shilling a pound. It is served with about half 
the due proportion of vegetables. The result is that, 



VEGETABLES 197 

on a hungry day, appetites are satisfied with meat 
and vegetables averaging about tenpence a pound 
instead of with meat and vegetables working out 
at sixpence or sevenpence all round. Let vegetables 
therefore abound both in War-time and in Peace- 
time. They are natural, they are refined, they are 
healthful, and they are cheap. 



CHAPTER X 

ROASTING AND GRILLING 

Roasting and grilling have been twin glories of the 
English kitchen. Grilling is still understood and well 
practised among us ; but roasting is almost a lost 
art in town households. When we speak of roast 
beef we generally mean beef baked in an oven. 
The Baked Beef of New England eats well : but it 
is not a roast. 



Brillat Savarin said that while one can learn to be a 
cook, one must be born a roaster. And even when 
roasting has degenerated into baking, an innate in- 
stinct for the process will go nearly all the way. In 
old-fashioned roasting it was customary to begin by 
keeping the joint thirteen or fourteen inches from the 
fire so as to draw out enough fat and gravy to form, 
a little later on, when the meat was brought nearer to 
the heat, a brown coat. In baking a joint the same 
principle should be followed. Modern cookery books 
generally advise the immediate introduction of the 
meat into a high temperature for the purpose of 
" sealing " in the juices. This is a good counsel, but 
it would be still better if it were prefaced by instruc- 
tions to provoke a very slight preliminary cooking 
in order that the sealing may be done with what I 
may call the right kind of wax rather than by a 

198 



ROASTING AND GRILLING 199 

scorching of the outside of the meat, or with fat from 
another source. 



Everybody knows that basting is essential to good 
roasting. But, when the sealing has been improperly 
done, the basting is almost useless, because the surface 
of the meat does not take it. 



Joints which are about to be baked should not 
rest upon the floor of the baking-tin but upon 
an ordinary trivet, such as one always receives with 
a gas-stove. Without the trivet, the lower part of 
the meat would be standing in grease and would 
become sodden. 



Novices sometimes dust their joints over with salt 
before putting them into the oven. This is wrong, 
because it hardens the fibres of the meat. The salting 
should be done when the baking is nearly finished. 



With these few hints and warnings in your mind, 
you cannot do better than continue to roast or bake 
in the established English way. Do not believe all 
you hear in praise of certain patent roasting-machines 
or baking-boxes. I have tried most of them and 
have given them away to curates for jumble sales. 
It is true that tough meat can be made tender in some 
of these contrivances, but they are stuffy. The ideal 
roast is a beast or bird roasted before a wood fire in 



200 HOME COOKERY IN WAR TIME 

the open air. This is not a fancy ; and any ill- 
ventilated cooking-box or oven works dead against 
the best principles of roasting. 



Grilling or broiling is performed in most houses 
nowadays by using the deflector on a gas-stove. An 
old-world gridiron is better but it requires skill, 
especially in the management of the fire. Although 
very few readers of this book are likely to have a grid- 
iron and a suitable fireplace, I must try to raise the 
banner of the ideal once more. Rough-and-ready 
teachers of cookery do not attempt to expound the 
inmost secret of grilling. They tell you to seal both 
sides of your chop or steak by exposure to a rather 
fierce gas-heat at the outset, and then to reduce the 
temperature and allow the meat to remain between 
the trivet and the deflector until it is cooked through. 
This process certainly turns out a very tasty little 
piece of meat, but it is more like a miniature roast 
than a true grillade. The proper way is to coat the 
meat lightly on both sides with good olive oil or 
freshly melted butter, and to grill it under a strong 
but not unruly heat, turning it with a small pair of 
tongs four or five times each minute. The object of 
this turning is to prevent the browning of the surfaces. 
Tongs must be used instead of a fork, because, in the 
absence of a firm sealing, a pair of tongs is the only 
tool with which one can avoid wounding the meat and 
allowing gravy to escape. 

We must, however, be practical, and I do not press 
this best way of grilling upon those who are perfectly 
satisfied with the method usually taught : because 



ROASTING AND GRILLING 201 

I know that the best way could hardly be followed 
on a smaU gas-stove. 

We are giving less space to roasting and grilling than 
to steaming and braising and stewing, simply because 
roasts and griUades are rarely successful except when 
they consist of expensive cuts of meat, and this book 
is against such extravagances. An exception some- 
times occurs as regards roasting, because it is possible 
now and then to buy good game-birds at low prices. 
Much of the cheap frozen game is not worth cooking or 
eating ; but bargains in fresh game are to be picked 
up occasionally. When they present themselves, 
they should not be neglected ; because roasted birds 
furnish materials for the cheap but distinguished 
salmis so fully described in the chapter on Entrees. 

Grillades represent a heavy initial cost for prime 
meat, but they become cheap food provided that the 
consumers are content to flavour a large quantity of 
vegetables with quite a small piece of prime and 
succulent beef or mutton. Take, for example, the 
dish known as an Entrecote h la Bordelaise. This is 
a grilled steak on which one spreads slices of blanched 
beef-marrow and some butter, with salt and pepper 
and chopped shalots and parsley and a little lemon 
juice. Some of the chopped vegetables and herbs are 
mixed with a glass of red Bordeaux wine and the 
whole plat is put to finish in a fireproof dish in a good 
oven. Of course you must not over-grill the steak in 
the first instance, but let it be underdone. [I am 
stating the rapid and homely recipe rather than the 



202 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

directions which would be given by a chef.] For a 
total expenditure of about two shillings on the steak 
and wine and sundries and a large cauliflower, four 
persons can be sufficiently though not lavishly served. 
By using potatoes and French beans or scarlet runners 
or mashed turnips or Jerusalem artichokes, the dish 
may be made to go even further, as the gravy and 
sauce will sufBce to make a liberal helping of vege- 
tables quite tempting. 

Grilled kidneys, grilled mushrooms, and the various 
grillades associated with the conventional EngHsh 
breakfast, do not need describing here. Besides, I 
hope that the War may lead to the simplification of 
our English breakfast, and that Englishmen will drop 
the habit of requiring cooks to work for them elabor- 
ately at the beginning of the day. Devilled meats 
for luncheon or as dinner savouries are on a different 
footing, and, when the Allies enter Berlin, I shall be 
happy to give to every reader who will ask for it a 
copy of my very own recipe for a dish called Seven 
Devils. 

This short section shall be closed with some direc- 
tions for cooking a steak in a manner which partakes 
of both baking and braising. In my own kitchen this 
method is frequently adopted and, nine times out of 
ten, visitors say that they have never enjoyed a steak 
so much before. This way is not for hot weather. 

Melt in an oval fireproof dish, two inches deep, a 
bare ounce of butter. [We sometimes use a cocoanut 
butter — a special kind in which the taste of the nut 



ROASTING AND GRILLING 203 

is not suppressed. Cocoanut butter goes a long 
way, and half-an-ounce is enough.] Trim about a 
pound and a half of rump steak, but do not remove 
the good fat. Flour the steak on both sides and fry 
it, also on both sides, in the fireproof dish, on the top 
of the stove, until it browns nicely. Then simply 
cover the dish closely and put it in a good oven. 
Reduce the heat of the oven (if it is warmed by gas) 
as soon as you close the oven door. At the end of 
half-an-hour take out and uncover the dish. The 
upper side of the steak will have become darker. 
Turn the meat over. Add one tablespoonful of hot 
water, mixing the water well with the butter and 
gravy at the bottom of the dish. Cover the dish 
closely again and put it back into a slow oven for 
another hour at least, taking it out once or twice more 
to baste and turn it. At the last turning, salt and 
pepper both sides. Should the gravy be finally 
found scanty and sticky, it can be extended with more 
hot water. 

This is one more of the dishes which, although 
made from a prime and dear cut, may subserve 
economy. The cook who prepares it for the first time 
will be inclined to throw away a kind of liquid fat 
which will have formed in the cooking : yet this fat 
is delicious and it makes the vegetables taste so good 
that not much meat is needed for each person. 
Mashed potatoes, or a puree (not sloppy) of turnips 
or Jerusalem artichokes, or a cabbage, or a cauliflower, 
each and aU lend themselves to moistening with the 
liquid. One does not throw away the liquor from 
good bacon, and it is just as wrong to throw away the 
liquor from good beef, 



CHAPTER XI 

SALADS 

A FULL-DRESS dinner, more than any other function 
exhibits the complexity of civihsation. In order to 
bring together the hundreds of items essential to the 
meal itself and to the service and surroundings, thou- 
sands of men and women have worked hard and 
skilfully. Peasants have flogged olive-trees ; fisher- 
men have braved the storm ; gardeners have stooped 
and delved under broiling suns ; shepherds have 
watched their flocks under driving rain ; hunters 
have waited wearily for the whir of wings ; dairy- 
maids have risen with the lark ; vignerons have fought 
the thousand enemies of the vine. To bring the 
dainties of the world to our shores, dock labourers 
have strained their backs, and stokers have almost 
melted away before ships' furnaces. Merchants have 
knitted their brows, shopmen have stood through 
long days amidst delicacies they will never taste, and 
boys whose hearts are on the battlefield or the high 
seas have trudged hither and thither bent under heavy 
loads. Bees have hummed in the hearts of flowers 
to build up the candles, or dynamos have buzzed still 
more loudly to give floods of light. In Ulster, men 
and women have spun fine linen ; in Staffordshire and 
in many a German or Austrian town they have shaped 
and cut frail porcelain and thin glass. And these do 
not exhaust the great army which has toiled and 

204 



SALADS 205 

moiled in order that half-a-dozen people may eat and 
drink supremely well. 



In the midst of all this artificiality the salad, usually 
served with the roast, has the charm of a return to 
nature. It is like a picnic on the fourth or fifth day 
of a house-party which has been feasting too royally, 
or it is like Marie Antoinette's Petit Trianon amidst 
the pomps of Versailles. Or, rather, this is what a 
salad ought to be. Unfortunately, English house- 
keepers often repeat with their salads the grand mis- 
take which they make with their soups. That is to 
say, they try to work up a salad into a dish rich and 
elaborate enough for a complete meal, forgetting that 
it is almost always better as an accompaniment to 
something else. I have seen English salads which 
could not be explained on any other theory. 



While a salad, in the middle of a long dinner, is a 
cool oasis of escape from the richness of cooked foods, 
this is not its only attraction. A salad will help 
down many a dry slice of cold meat which would 
otherwise offend the palate. And, while pleasing 
both palate and eye, it may be also a valuable food. 
We know that nearly two thousand years ago one of 
the most famous of physicians used to eat the plant 
which we call a cabbage-lettuce nearly every evening 
to induce sleep. I often carry out his prescription, 
and find a cabbage-lettuce to be a much more effective 
and less objectionable nightcap than a whisky-and- 
soda. As for watercress, its value is enormous. 



2o6 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

Salad plants of one kind or another are obtainable in 
England all the year round at low prices and nobody 
has any excuse for neglecting them. If some of our 
commercial men would eat a little less meat and 
potatoes, and much more salad, they would come and 
go with clearer skins and brighter eyes and quicker 
steps. 



A few weeks before the War broke out, I wrote some 
notes on salad-making and they were published in a 
little periodical called Downman s Bulletin, which is 
circulated privately. These notes were reproduced 
by many newspapers in an abridged form and I have 
been asked to print them over again in the present 
volume. Here they are : 

L; Wine and Oil 

In ancient writings, both sacred and profane, oil and 
wine are linked over and over again. And in Italy, 
even in this twentieth century, the wine merchant 
is still an oil merchant as weU. In England, culinary 
and edible oils have fallen among grocers ; and grocers 
in these days are more often concerned with " cheap 
lines ' ' than with hoary traditions of fine eating. Their 
salad oils are generally blends of inferior oil with 
the oil from cotton seed and various nuts. 

Now the housewife who saves sixpence on a large 
bottle of salad oil is as foolish as her sister who saves 
sixpence on a pound of tea. If a bottle of oil or a pound 
of tea were wholly consumed at a single meal, one could 
understand the housewife's wish to economise ; be- 



SALADS 207 

cause sixpence a day is nearly ten pounds a year. But 
a bottle of oil serves for many salads, just as a pound 
of tea suffices for dozens of pots and scores of cups : 
and it follows that, for the sake of a farthing, a meal 
is being spoilt. To be exact, the farthing is not truly 
saved ; because one must use more of poor oil or poor 
tea than of the better quality. 

The best oil — better than the famous oil of Lucca or 
of San Remo — is the oil of Provence ; and the best oil of 
Provence is that which finds its way to the markets 
of Bordeaux. Bordeaux is a city of epicures ; because 
Bordeaux flourishes by reason of the finely educated 
palates of the merchants who are always tasting, 
tasting, tasting the almost innumerable growths and 
vintages of the Medoc and of the other wine-growing 
regions of the Gironde. This oil is pure and unmixed 
olive oil of the old kind, and there is nothing to beat 
it as food or as medicine. The doctors, who are 
.prescribing olive oil more and more, should see to it 
that their patients do not swallow a coarse blend of 
oils made from nuts and seeds. 

A good salad means good oil. It means also good 
vinegar, or a fresh and juicy lime or lemon. Wine 
vinegar is better than malt vinegar ; but it must be 
remembered that wine vinegar is strong and that the 
quantity used must be smaller than when malt vinegar 
is chosen. 



I am often asked to give my prescription for a 
salad. This, however, is an art and a science which 
cannot be reduced to writing. Salad vegetables vary 
enormously in succulency and briskness ; and the 



2o8 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

born salad-maker is always changing his procedure. 
But, although nothing can take the place of an incom- 
municable skill and judgment, some rough-and-ready 
hints may be set down. 

In every house there ought to be a punier a salade.^ 
In France every peasant's wife knows how to wield one. 
A punier d salade is a wire basket, with a rather narrow 
mouth like that of an old Chinese ginger jar. After 
washing your cress and lettuce and other greenery, 
you drop the leaves into this wire basket and whirl it 
smartly round by the wire handle, thus causing every 
drop of water to fly out. It is because of the wetness 
of their materials that most makers of salads in 
England fail ; for oil and water will never agree. 

Nowadays almost everybody knows that the leaves 
of a salad must be torn and not cut. I should hesitate 
to print so trite a precept if I had not had recent 
evidence that it is still disregarded here and there. 
In punishment for my sins (which are many and black, 
but neither many nor black enough for such reprisals) 
I was invited to the house of a lady with a local reputa- 
tion for her salads. In a large and costly bowl I 
found a number of lettuces which had been cut up 
finely with a knife some hours before. To these there 
had been added hard-boiled eggs and tomatoes in 
quarters, and a drench of a strange cream. The 
mixture had a certain tastiness which was seductive, 
but the night watches brought insight and penitence. 
Not until he has tasted his salad plants can a salad- 
maker compound his dressing. Some plants require 

^ In speaking to Frenchmen, one should be caxeful to re- 
member that a panier d salade means also a prison van, or 
" Black Maria." 



SALADS 209 

more salt than others, and this is not the only opening 
for tact. It may be said, however, that there is much 
truth in the old counsel : " Let a miser put in the 
vinegar, a spendthrift the oil, and a wise man the 
salt." The wisdom of the wise man will be shown, for 
example, in giving much more salt to a tomato than 
to a lettuce. As for the oil and the vinegar, English- 
women nearly always make the mistake of pouring 
out far too much vinegar and far too little oil. They 
are afraid that the oil will taste gross, but the truth is 
that the oil may greatly exceed the vinegar and still 
not assert itself. In some salads, pepper and even 
made mustard and a drop or so of Worcester sauce 
should be added. Experiment alone will teach how 
and when and why these things should be done. 

To the old proverb just quoted, it is often added 
that a madman should stir up the whole. Madmen, 
however, are better out of the way. When the salad 
plants are in the bowl, the dressing should be mixed in 
a large wooden spoon or in a cup, and after it has been 
beaten smooth it should be quickly poured over the 
leaves and then there should be a bold and strong and 
rapid turning of the greenery over and over until every 
leaf has taken its share of the dressing. This operation 
must be postponed until a moment or two before the 
salad is wanted. Otherwise the plants will come 
sodden to the table. 

At this point my voice sinks to a whisper, and it is 
to be understood that I am speaking privately and 
confidentially and with bated breath to the gourmet 
only. The Almighty has given tis better tools for salad- 
mixing than any wooden fork and spoon. In conditions 
of homely intimacy, a salad-maker, when all is ready, 
o 



210 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

will wash his hands well and long as the moment 
approaches for serving the bowl. He will shun 
common or perfmned soaps and will use nothing but 
a soap made from olive oil. Having dried his hands 
perfectly on a warm, clean towel, he will finally whisk 
the cup of dressing into homogeneity, will pour its 
contents over the salad, and will immediately proceed 
to wring the leaves in the liquid as a washerwoman 
wrings clothes in soapy water. (How horrid !) In 
doing this, he will spoil the appearance of some of the 
leaves, but he will have a salad fit for the gods. 

When tomato is wanted, thin slices should be lightly 
sprinkled with dressing and added to a salad after the 
mixing with fork and spoon or with the hands. If they 
are added before, they will break and make the salad 
look messy. The young leaves of nasturtiums and 
the unopened flowers greatly improve an ordinary 
salad of lettuce and watercress. A few fully opened 
flowers of nasturtium may be added at the last 
moment for their appearance, and some of the seeds 
may be thrown in as well. [End of " Wine and Oil."] 



To the foregoing paragraphs I should add one or 
two remarks. A spoonful of cream added to a salad 
of cabbage-lettuce is an improvement when the salad 
is served with lean beef or any other food which re- 
quires a little fat. [The cream would be a mistake 
in a salad served with roast duck.] 



Many earnest students of table matters would not 
agree with my advice for dressing salads. Their 



SALADS 211 

method is to accumulate their washed and dried 
ingredients in a bowl and then to dust in the pepper 
and salt. Afterwards they take an oil-bottle in the 
left hand and a wooden fork in the right. They pour 
in the oil drop by drop, turning the salad plants so 
that all may be oiled. Finally, they add a spoonful of 
vinegar and proceed to " fatigue " the salad by turning 
it over and over. 



When a little pool of fine salad-dressing remains at 
the bottom of the bowl, it need not be wasted. Every 
scrap of greenery should be lifted out of it and the 
dressing can then be added to a soup. On hot days I 
use it after a fashion which I learned from a muleteer 
in Spain. I chop up a good piece of cucumber and mix 
it in the dressing with the crumb of a slice of household 
bread. This makes a wonderfully refreshing com- 
pound, like meat and drink in one. But it does not 
suit all tastes, and most of us are so placed that we 
should not find an opportunity of eating it. 



A Cold Slaw is popular in Kentucky. Having 
blanched a firm white cabbage, the Kentucky cook 
cuts it up into long narrow strips, longer than matches 
but no thicker. Sometimes he mixes in some strips 
of blanched celery, equally thin. He adds (though 
this is not indispensable) a tablespoonful of the 
melted fat which is jdelded by the grilling or frjdng of 
the breakfast bacon. Finally he smothers the strips 
in thinned mayonnaise and serves the "Slaw" 
cold. 



212 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

When salad plants are bought, the minimum 
quantities which can be purchased to advantage will 
often make too large a heap to be eaten on one day. 
Instead of wasting what is not required, the surplus 
should be used for soup or in some entree. A recipe 
has already been given for watercress soup. Braised 
lettuce is excellent. 



CHAPTER XII 

SWEETS AND OMELETTES 

An earnest person who has seen the plan of this book 
is grieved to know that sweets are not to be dis- 
couraged in it. [The earnest person happens to be a 
man who hates sweets with his whole soul, but one 
must charitably acquit him of selfishness and in- 
sincerity.] To some extent he is right. It is beyond 
doubt that most grown-up Britons would be better in 
health and temper if puddings and pies and tarts and 
cakes and meringues were more rarely seen on their 
plates. For children it is a prudent as well as a kindly 
course to provide sweetstuff ; but older people are the 
worse, in nine cases out of ten, for consuming them 
largely and frequently. 



Sweets, in spite of this warning, cannot be omitted 
from a cookery-book. As, however, they belong to 
that branch of cookery in which the English are 
strong, I do not doubt that most of my readers could 
teach me more than I can teach them under this 
head. I shall therefore recognise my limitations and 
describe only a few sweets which experience has 
vindicated at little homely dinners for both men and 
women, and I shall prefer to speak of those which can 
be served either as sweets or savouries according to the 
flavouring and seasoning. 
213 



214 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

Pancakes are nearly always popular. I have some- 
times treated them as savouries rather than as sweets 
by introducing piquant little choppings of meat or 
fish or vegetables instead of preserves or powdered 
sugar. Such garnishes should be very sparing in 
quantity and should be separately heated so that there 
shall not be an instant's delay. They must not be 
too moist. A pancake costs less than an omelette, 
but can be nicer as a vehicle for savoury morsels. 



Although omelettes, owing to the well-known 
difficulty of making them without breaking eggs, will 
be out of the programme of the thrifty as a rule, 
occasions may arise when they are justified. A 
present of eggs may arrive from a country friend, or 
eggs may be cheap for a little while in the shops, or 
an invalid may have to be coaxed regardless of ex- 
pense. I cannot do better than transcribe the direc- 
tions for omelette-making from the little book by Mr 
Peter Gallina, already referred to. Mr Gallina owes 
part of his success to his practice of inviting his 
customers to make their way down into his kitchens 
any morning, just before the busiest moments of 
lunch, to see omelettes made by professional cooks. 
His advice is as follows : — 

" English people nearly always fail to make a good 
omelette. Yet this is a dish which anybody can pre- 
pare, once the right way is known. 

" Have a pan of hammered steel. After making 
an omelette, never wash the pan with water, but wipe 
it immediately with a clean cloth. 



SWEETS AND OMELETTES 215 

" Plain omelette. Put a small piece of butter in 
the pan, on a hot stove or fire. While the butter is 
coming to a froth, whisk two eggs (whites and yolks 
together) in a basin with a little salt and pepper. 
When they are well mixed, pour them into the pan. 
As soon as the bottom of the omelette begins to set, 
shake the pan vigorously. Then let the contents 
settle flat again (which will require only a few moments) 
and the omelette will be ready. A hot plate must be 
at hand to receive it. With practice you can learn 
to give the pan a last shake in such a way that the 
omelette will fold itself neatly over without your 
touching it. 

" Omelette au Fromage. This is made like a plain 
omelette, with two differences. First, you must mix 
some grated Parmesan cheese with the eggs before 
cooking them ; and secondly, you must sprinkle some 
more Parmesan on the finished omelette. 

" Omelette aux Fines Herbes. Mix your fines 
herbes (or chopped parsley) with the eggs, then 
proceed exactly as if you were making a plain 
omelette. 

" Omelette Lyonnaise. Chop an onion finely and 
cook it in the butter till soft. Pour the beaten eggs 
on top, and complete as usual. 

" Omelette Portugaise. Cook apart some tomato 
in butter. Spread it, hot, on top of a plain 
omelette. 

" Omelette aux Rognons. Cut a nice veal (or one 
sheep's) kidney into small dice. Cook the dice, in 
butter, in a separate pan. Add a teaspoonful of 
Madeira. Then prepare a plain omelette, open it, 
and put the kidney inside." 



2i6 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

We have wandered away from sweets into savouries, 
as I said we should. So let us return to sweets by 
way of Omelettes aux Confitures, au Rhum and au 
Kirsch. For the first, warm the jam, and proceed as 
for a kidney or for a tomato omelette. For " flaming " 
omelettes, mix a small teaspoonful of castor sugar 
with the beaten eggs in the first instance and 
proceed as for a plain omelette. When it is made, 
fold the omelette, pour over it a tablespoonful of 
rum, dust some more castor sugar over the top, 
and apply the match. The plate must be very 
hot. Should your rum be too much "below proof" 
warm it a little beforehand and it will take fire 
more readily. 



Fritters are easy to make, provided that there is no 
weakening from the standard for frying in a deep 
bath of fat — that is to say, a bath nearly three inches 
deep. This fat must be very hot at the moment of 
dropping in the fritter. To make sure that the fat is 
boihng, it is a good plan to test it with a tiny portion 
of batter. If the fat be hot enough, the batter will 
rise instantly to the surface, with a brisk frizzling. 
As to the composition of the fritters, you can apply 
to them the principle which has just been stated for 
pancakes and omelettes — ^that is to say, they can be 
either sweet or savoury. Fritters of banana and 
apple and apricot and orange are known to everybody, 
but these do not exhaust the possibihties. I have 
made fritters with almost every kind of edible. 
Pieces of chicken, of smoked haddock, of cold fish, of 
cauliflower and even of young and dehcate turnips are 



SWEETS AND OMELETTES 217 

worth eating in fritter form. Indeed one can take 
a collection of choice odds and ends and decide which 
shall be hers d'oeuvre and which shall be savouries 
according to the general complexion of the dinner. 
Some menus would be well introduced, for example, 
by a hors d'oeuvre of sprigs of cauliflower and oil and 
vinegar. Other menus would be more satisfactory 
with no hors d'oeuvre at all, but with the same cauli- 
flower worked up into fritters. It goes without saying 
that the fritters must not be greasy. To prevent this, 
a cook must beware of putting too many fritters into 
the fat at the same time. I have already pointed out 
the importance of absolutely boiling fat, and it is 
obvious that, if too many raw cold fritters are suddenly 
introduced, the temperature of the fat will fall to 
such a point that the batter and frying-fat will com- 
mingle and the result will be a heavy and greasy little 
cannon-ball instead of a golden-brown bubble. I have 
sometimes made very smaU fritters containing sections 
of a juicy lemon, altogether unsweetened. A pinch 
of salt is sprinkled on them at the moment of serving 
and they are used as a garnish to fish or entrees. I 
ought to add, however, that everybody cannot be 
depended on to like them. 



A really wholesome sweet, suitable for young and 
old, is the boiled or steamed pudding made in a basin 
with flour, breadcrumbs and chopped suet and an eg§, 
with a httle milk and some flavourings. Lemon 
pudding, marmalade pudding and ginger pudding 
are excellent, and the recipes for making them are so 
well known to everybody that I need add no more 



2i8 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

than point out the superiority of flour and breadcrumb 
to unmixed flour. 

The other kind of steamed pudding, made by lining 
a basin with a thin sheet of dough and covering it, 
after it has been filled with sections of apple or other 
fruit, by means of a dough lid (or with the margins 
of the dough-sheet folded over), is another valuable 
addition to a cheap and wholesome dietary. This 
method can be used for meats as well as fruits, al- 
though it would then become a homely entree rather 
than a savoury, as it is a dish substantial enough for 
the whole meal of a hungr}^ man. 



I do not recommend the frequent use of jellies, 
custards and blanc-manges, made from the contents 
of low-priced packets. Towards the end of the nine- 
teenth century such things began to be bought much 
too freely, with the result that many of the housewives 
of to-day do not know how to make jelly from a calf's 
foot or to prepare an old-fashioned custard. There 
is no royal road in either of these matters ; and the 
truthful spirit of the little George Washington does 
not inspire the advertisements which assert that 
custards and jellies made from the cheap materials 
in packets are as good as those with which the fatted 
calf and the clucking hen can provide us. When I 
see a jelly or a custard in an ordinary house or at a 
seaside hotel my heart sinks. And yet jellies and 
custards ought to rank high among our sweets. JeUies 
flavoured with wine, and custards with or without 
stewed fruits, are too honourable to be parodied from 
the wholesale grocer's laboratory. 



SWEETS AND OMELETTES 219 

When the art of making light pastry has been ac- 
quired, the door is opened to a multitude of good 
things. Pastry need not be expensive. The sub- 
stitutes for butter which are made nowadays from 
cocoanuts and other nuts should be tried for pastry. 
A few experiments will be necessary, and a failure 
or two must not cause discouragement. These are 
no days for the most expensive pastes, such as the 
puff paste, which requires a pound of butter to a pound 
of flour. On the other hand, it is a mistake to starve 
the pastry too much. I am persuaded that a certain 
style of English pie crust has done almost as much 
harm as drink. Indeed it is a cause of drink. It 
provokes indigestion and bad temper, and brings so 
much discord into the home as to drive out of it those 
who have the means to go elsewhere. I have seen 
on a working man's table a meat pie which was to be 
followed by an apple pie. His wife's excuse was 
that, having the pastry and having the oven hot, it 
was only natural to make the two kinds of pies at the 
same time. Both were served hot. Good materials 
had been used, but with so little skill that the pastry 
made one wish for plenty of elbow-room and a coal- 
hammer. The husband was a builder's foreman, 
with a little clerical work to do in the afternoons 
which was a trial to him. It is not to be wondered at 
that he left his wooden hut three times that afternoon 
for a soothing dram at the " Three Jolly Bricklayers." 



With good pastry, every stage of a dinner can be 
improved, from the hors d'oeuvre to the sweets. [I do 
not mean pastry at more than one stage each day.] 



220 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

When there is a tiny remainder of paste, one can make 
tiny tartlets, filled with potted meat or any other tasty 
filling, to serve cold among the hors d'oeuvre or hot 
as a savoury. Little crescents of light pastry may be 
thrown at the last moment into suitable soups. Fish 
can be cooked in pastry. As for entrees, there are 
dozens of ways of presenting meats in light pastry- 
shells, which should be less stodgy than the meat 
turnovers sometimes given to schoolboys when they 
go out for a day's ramble. Pies, filled with meat or 
birds, or ground-game, or a mixture of these with 
vegetables ; with fresh fruit, or with fruit preserved 
according to the directions in the introductory chapter 
— all these are known to everybody and are worth 
learning to make really well. 



Open tarts can be made in the English fashion and 
filled with inexpensive preserves. The jam should 
not be dried up by too much heat and should be 
spread over the paste only a few minutes before the 
baking is concluded. 



An apple tart in the French style is a pleasant change. 
To make it you must have what is called a tart ring, 
about one inch deep. Having buttered the inside of 
the ring, you roll out a sheet of pastry about a quarter 
of an inch thick. You should prepare the pastry 
as for " short crust," using less than half-a-pound of 
butter, or butter substitute, to the pound of flour. 
Lay the sheet of pastry over the ring and press it 
neatly home all round so that it makes a shallow 



SWEETS AND OMELETTES 221 

circular receptacle with perpendicular sides. Trim 
the top edges, not quite close. Of course you will 
not be doing all these things without having placed 
the ring on a baking-tin. A round case of this kind 
is called a flan. A flan admits of many uses. For 
some things it is best to bake it empty, so that the 
filling will not be dried in the oven. [In suggesting 
that you should bake it empty, I ought to warn you 
that the flan might lose its shape if you did not pack 
it loosely with some dry objects, such as haricot beans, 
which can be taken out after the flan has set.] For 
the French apple tart you will not bake the flan before 
filling it. You will take some pulp of apples which 
the French call apple-marmalade. This is made by 
cooking some apples with butter and sugar in a small 
pan until they subside into a pulp. You must not 
use the pulp until it is cold. Prick all over the bottom 
of the flan, sprinkle in it a good handful of biscuit 
crumbs, and then add the pulp until it is filled to 
within about a third of an inch of the brim. Next, 
pick out a fine and sound apple, peel it, core it, and 
cut it into about sixteen crescent -shaped pieces, like 
the thinnest sections of an orange. Arrange these 
sections so as to overlap one another in a long waving 
curve over the whole surface of the pulp. The flan 
and its contents must now be baked at a good heat 
until the pastry is seen to be properly baked. On 
taking it from the oven, carefully remove the ring 
and the apple tart is ready. Many French cooks 
add a little pulp of apricots a few minutes before the 
baking is finished, the pulp being smeared over 
the apples. I do not recommend this course. If the 
apples lack flavour, I should add grated lemon rind 



222 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

to the apples and butter and sugar when making the 
pulp. [An ingenious cook can play many variations 
on this recipe. I have used a pulp of plums, cutting 
neat sections from large Victoria plums for the top 
layer, and, although I have not yet made the experi- 
ments, no doubt use could be made of some of the 
very cheap fruits which have been sun-dried or 
evaporated.] 



Junkets are interesting and easy to make. They 
have the advantage of setting more quickly than jelly 
when one cannot command the use of a very cold 
larder. A good junket should be smooth and firm. 
Less popular than junkets, but better, in my opinion, 
are the jellies and creams which can be made cheaply 
with the aid of Irish moss. This strange sea-moss 
comes from the most savage spots on the coasts of 
Connaught. I have used it in Connemara scores of 
times, and have only failed when I have used too 
much. Irish moss as received from the gatherers 
requires careful cleaning, because tiny shells and sea- 
creatures lodge in it. Even when it is obtained at a 
shop it should be well washed before it is used. 
Containing as it does sulphur and iodine in a kind of 
natural gum, it is supposed to be a health-giving plant, 
especially to those persons whose chests are not 
strong. Whenever I see some of the wretched sheets 
of gelatine which are used in invalid cookery, I wish 
that Irish moss might come into its own. The blanc- 
mange and beef-tea jelly prepared for the sick with 
the aid of gelatine would often be far better with Irish 
moss, which is used like gelatine or isinglass. The 



SWEETS AND OMELETTES 223 

various gelatines, whether natural or prepared, are 
overrated except as vehicles for better nourishment. 



Stewed fruits are useful, but it is a pity to make 
them out of fruits which are good enough to eat in 
the natural state. I have eaten wretched stews of 
cherries with imitation custards when at less expense 
my hostess could have given her guests a pretty 
basket of cherries beautiful to behold and far better 
to eat. The art of cookery lifts mankind above the 
level of the savage ; but it does not follow that we 
are obliged to cook everything we can lay our hands 
on. Millions of fine plums and pears and apples and 
blackberries and raspberries find a sugary grave every 
year. As a general rule, let no fruit be stewed unless 
it is not quite good enough to eat. 



As for rice and sago and semolina and tapioca pud- 
dings, I repeat the warning that these soft foods are 
dangerous because children are inclined to bolt them 
without the salivation which they demand. If they 
can be served with stewed rhubarb which has not 
been stewed to death or with stewed apples or pears 
which retain some firmness, they will be swallowed 
less hurriedly and may be less objectionable. Eaten 
properly, they are immensely valuable to nearly all 
children and to many grown-up persons. 



The apple lends itself admirably to the making of 
sweets and savouries. When the core is taken out 



224 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

and its place filled with a little butter and sugar, a 
baked apple is excellent. Instead of butter and sugar 
you can use a mixture of butter and apple chutney, 
thus turning out a savoury apple, which is not unhke 
the curried apples familiar to some Russian house- 
wives. Jam also replaces the butter and sugar 
successfully, where children are concerned. 



Stewed prunes are good when the prunes are not 
too skinny. They may be eaten with a rather stiff 
and creamy rice pudding, or the stones can be taken 
out and the stewed prune stuffed with cream or cream 
cheese. 



Cheese-cakes must not be encouraged in War-time, 
as the lemon cheese or curd used for filling them re- 
quires good eggs and plenty of them. 



Tinned fruits of good brands are not to be despised 
by thrifty persons. Tinned pears of the best packings 
cannot easily be beaten by the fresh fruit. They are 
good enough to be consumed just as they are. On 
occasions of ceremony, however, a piece of a pear can 
be laid at the bottom of a champagne glass and en- 
livened with a teaspoonful of good raspberry jam, a 
few drops of Kirsch, a drench of thick cream, some 
frothed white of egg and a crystaUised cherry. Some- 
thing similar can be done with tinned peaches and 
apricots. Preserved pine-apples are useful for fritters ; 
and I have also fallen back upon them for the 



SWEETS AND OMELETTES 225 

fruit salad or macedoine which I am about to 
describe. 

Open a tin of cheap pine-apple chunks from a good 
shop and cut them into thin sUces with a silver knife 
and fork. If oranges happen to be cheap and sweet 
and juicy, peel two of them and break them into the 
smallest sections, taking care to free them entirely 
from the white skin and pith. In taking the pips 
out of these bits of orange you will have to break the 
sections, but this is an advantage, as it enables the 
orange juice to run out and the other juices to run in. 
If your party is to be large, buy also one of the in- 
expensive little tins of peeled Muscat grapes. Lay 
the grapes open with a silver knife and lift out the 
stones. If you have a sound and very ripe and juicy 
pear, peel and core and slice it. Put all these in- 
gredients in a glass dish and pour over them the juice 
from the pine-apple chunks and the peeled grapes, 
mixed with a glass of sherry or, better still, a dessert- 
spoonful of Kirsch or Cura9ao or Maraschino. A few 
minutes before the salad is to be eaten, add two 
bananas sliced into thin discs. With a silver spoon 
drench the discs of banana with the juice, but do not 
break them by too much tinrning over. Serve the 
salad as it is, or with a little cream. This macedoine 
wiU cost between twopence and threepence a portion, 
but it is a distinguished as well as a refreshing con- 
clusion to a dinner. 



In the chapter called ''' Going to Market " I pro- 
mised to explain a good way of serving a cheap ripe 
pine-apple. Take a long narrow cake-knife with a 



226 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

" saw " back. Lay the pine-apple sideways on a large 
meat -plate and cut off the bottom at the point where 
the sides begin to narrow downwards. Then cut off 
the top, tuft and all, at the point where the sides 
begin to narrow upwards. You must perform both 
these amputations as cleanly and straightly as pos- 
sible. Put the top and bottom on one side. You 
will now be looking at what I may call the trunk of 
the pine -apple, or the central cylinder. Thrust in the 
sharp point of the cake-knife between the flesh and 
the skin and work it gently up until it comes out at 
the other end. Now begin to saw backwards just 
inside the circumference of the fruit so that you 
separate the flesh from the skin. Take care that 
you do not break through the skin at an}^ point. If 
you have done the work properly, you will be able 
to lift the whole of the peel in one piece clear of the 
flesh, like lifting up a tube four or five inches in 
diameter. The flesh will appear as a cylindrical mass 
exuding a great deal of juice which you must not lose. 
Turn this mass on its side and cut it briskly into thin 
slices without allowing them to fall apart . Then stand 
the mass upright and carefully encase it again in the 
tube of skin. Let it go on draining for some time and 
finally collect all the juice in a clear glass or silver 
jug. A few minutes before dinner, place the pine- 
apple in the middle of an epergne or any other raised- 
up stand and carefully restore the tufted top so as to 
fit exactly in its original position. Bank round the 
foot of the pine-apple with any dessert apples and 
pears and oranges which you may have in the house. 
If you have guests, they will look at the pine-apple 
throughout dinner with the usual conviction that it 



SWEETS AND OMELETTES 227 

is not intended to be cut and yet, although you may 
have paid for it no more than some conventional 
sweets would cost you, they will be filled with rever- 
ence for your royal hospitality. At the proper moment 
lift off the top and the tubular skin and you will be 
able to serve slices of pine-apple with no mess or fuss. 
The juice, which can be touched up with a little 
liqueur if you like, will be handed round in the glass 
jug or silver boat. 

I remember explaining the buying and preparing 
and serving of a pine-apple, on these lines, to a lady 
who had a weakness for giving ceremonious little 
dinners out of a slender income. After listening to me 
suspiciously she replied, to our mutual discomfort, that 
my idea was beyond her means. A few weeks later I 
heard of one of her dinners and it turned out that her 
principal sweet had consisted of a very tastefully 
arranged assortment of eclairs and hahas and mille 
feuilles and petits fours from a well-known confec- 
tioner's, which had certainly cost her more than my 
pine-apple cost me. To round off a dinner with 
ready-made wares from a pastrycook's is a hauling 
down of the flag which no housewife should come to 
without shame. Besides, a plateful of pastries recalls 
too vividly to the mind the rude remark of Thackeray, 
who, on being asked by his hostess which tart he 
would have, replied : " I think, ma'am, I should like 
a tuppenny one." 

In French families, at vintage-time, it is usual to 
boil some chestnuts and to eat them with a glassful of 
the cloudy new juice. About the end of September 
the little wine shops and cafes exhibit placards 



228 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

announcing " Sweet New White Wine." We do not 
make wine in England, although our forefathers did 
it pretty well ; but it is possible, none the less, to 
celebrate the wine harvest somewhat after the French 
fashion. When, in the course of your marketing, you 
notice that large white grapes are cheap, buy a pound 
or two of them. They will not cost you more than 
a few pence. [On the day of my writing this they are 
threepence a pound.] Throw out any shrivelled or 
rotten berries and wring the juice out of those which 
remain. There are many ways of doing this. One 
good plan is to break them with a wooden pestle and 
afterwards put the whole of the pulp in a piece of 
muslin, screwing it tighter until every drop of juice 
has come out. The juice, in spite of its cloudiness, 
should appear on the table in a glass jug or decanter. 
As for the chestnuts, try to get the Italian kind with 
only one inside skin. Wash the nuts, and, if you 
decide on boiling them, do so in any old saucepan. 
[It is a pity to use a new one, as the chestnuts would 
soil it.] Or you can cook the chestnuts on an old 
shovel over a good fire. Or you can roast them, as 
in the Cat and Monkey fable, which was evidently 
written by a man who knew more of monkeys than 
of cats. In some houses the peeling of the nuts is 
done at the table, each person doing his own work. 
Many Frenchmen crumble the chestnuts into the 
bottom of a glass, bedew them well with the grape 
juice and eat the mess with a spoon. This idea of 
grape juice and chestnuts is well worth carrying out ; 
for, while a chestnut is not so nutritious as a Brazil 
nut, it is still a valuable food when mixed with the 
juice of grapes. 



SWEETS AND OMELETTES 229 

It may not always be convenient to buy grapes and 
press them. At such times chestnuts can be made 
into a puree and flavoured with a little cream and 
vanilla. But I think they are nicest simply boiled 
or roasted. I shall always remember one bitterly 
cold evening in the Portuguese highlands. It was 
All Hallows' Eve. The whole dinner at my inn was 
excellent ; but it reached its climax when a Gallego 
brought me a tureen filled with magnificent chestnuts 
in their skins, piping hot. A bottle of old Bucellas 
wine was at my elbow and I had little difficulty in 
keeping alive. 



Nuts at the end of a meal must be sparingly con- 
sumed. From the standpoint of the theorist, we 
ought to expect the worst results from the nut-eating 
of some greedy people at Christmas. Nuts and dried 
fruit and a glass of port are a meal in themselves, so 
that the man who indulges in them after eating 
turkey and sausages and plum pudding is really 
beginning his meal over again. Fortunately, Brazil 
nuts are not at their best at Christmas, or the worst 
might happen. 



CHAPTER XIII 

ITALIAN PASTES 

Eighteen years ago it was my misfortune to be 
linked with a friend who held stoutly to the doctrine 
of " cutlet for cutlet." We were transacting some 
literary business together. I believe that when we 
dined at my house — say a dozen times — I " did him 
well." And I do not doubt that his reminiscences of 
the hospitality which he extended to me — say a dozen 
times — in a cheap Italian restaurant are, to him, 
equally satisfactory. He used to take me to a 
trattoria called " The Flora," which has disappeared. 
Dinners at " The Flora " were cheap and ample and 
bad. Nevertheless, as I sat on a velvet seat and 
looked at the worst mural paintings that even a 
modern Italian could conceive, and drank pasteurised 
wines, I learnt a great deal about cookery and dinners. 
The hors d'oeuvre always made a good show, though 
they were too oily to eat. The soup, though poor, was 
hot. The fish, though common, was fresh and clean. 
The entree, of frozen mutton with the cheapest tinned 
peas or French beans, would have made a convict 
weep ; and the leg of chicken, with barely half-an- 
ounce of meat between the skin and the bone, and the 
salad dressed with cotton-seed oil, were even worse 
than the entree. Yet I was able to endure these 
dinners because of an interlude described on the menu 
as farinage. Sometimes the farinage was simply 

230 



ITALIAN PASTES 231 

macaroni with grated cheese. At other times the 
white pipes were served in the manner of Naples 
or of Milan. On other evenings we had spaghetti, or 
nouilles, with grated cheese. And when the dinner 
was finished off with sleepy apples and unripe bananas 
and thick-skinned grapes and sugary raisins, I always 
managed to walk home with the goodly memory of 
the farinage triumphing over my horrid souvenirs of 
the coarser food. 

Farinage ought not to be served seven times a week 
at English tables. On the other hand, it ought not to 
be ignored. In the cathedral city where I was brought 
up there was an admirable grocer named Dutton. 
He was an out-and-out Englishman : but he preferred 
to call himself an Italian warehouseman, and among the 
exotic wonders of his window was a box of macaroni. 
The neighbouring duke, and the travelled ladies who 
were married to the bishop and the dean and the 
canons, bought macaroni now and then ; but they 
seemed to have an imperfect knowledge of its possi- 
bilities. They used to make macaroni puddings and 
nasty messes of macaroni and butter and cheese . Also 
they were accustomed to serve a soup made of vermi- 
celli and meat-stained hot water, which was supposed 
to demonstrate the inferiority of Continental to 
English cookery. But the citizens' wives in general 
left such things alone. 



Macaroni and the kindred Italian pastes are entitled 
to respect. It is important to buy good qualities only. 
At the Continental Stores in Dean Street, Soho, there 
is a man who seems to know a good deal about 



232 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

macaroni. He sells pastes in all kinds of shapes. 
For example, he has — I will translate the Italian — 
angels' tresses, bulls' eyes, shells, stars, and many 
other shapes of macaroni. These are cheap. At a 
higher price he has tubes of macaroni nearly an inch 
in diameter, into which one can push a small sausage 
or a stuffing so as to make the delicacy beloved of all 
Italians on Easter Sunday. He keeps grated Parmesan 
cheese and tomato pur6e as well. If you ask this 
excellent person for some recipes he will give them to 
you. I must, however, recognise the fact that all 
my readers do not live in London and I will therefore 
give them a few hints about macaroni. Buy it at a 
good shop. Boil it quickly in plenty of fast -boiling 
salted water, with the lid off the pan. [Wipe it with 
a dry cloth before you throw it into the boiling water, 
but do not soak it or wash it.] While it is boiling, 
stir it with a wooden spoon so that it shall not stick to 
the pan. Test it by squeezing a piece between the 
finger and thumb or by eating a scrap. As the various 
makes of macaroni differ one from another, the exact 
time for boiling cannot be stated, but the rule is that 
macaroni must not be cooked to the point of sloppiness. 
As soon as it is cooked it must be well shaken and 
drained through a colander or a sieve. When it is dry 
it can be served with butter and grated cheese, or it 
may be worked with a puree of tomatoes, or it may be 
served au gratin, or it may be used as a plain garnish 
with meat, or it will do as one of the ingredients in a 
vegetable soup. 



Nearly related to macaroni is the delicacy known 



ITALIAN PASTES 233 

as gniocchi. To make gniocchi you will need half-a- 
teacupful of semolina. Mix the semolina to a paste 
with cold milk. Then put about a pint of milk on the 
fire in a pan and, as soon as it boils, gradually work 
in the semolina. Let it boil, stirring it all the time, 
until the milk and the semolina have come thoroughly 
together. Take it off the fire and place the pan in a 
cold place. When the mixture is cool, spread it on a 
pasteboard to a thickness of rather less than half-an- 
inch, and cut it into squares. Lay these squares at 
the bottom of a fireproof dish and sprinkle flakes of 
butter and Parmesan cheese over them. Add another 
layer of the paste with more butter and cheese, and 
build on layer after layer till you have nothing left. 
Pour some gravy or really good stock into the dish 
and put it into a rather quick oven. Gniocchi with 
braised or stewed beef will go down extremely well. 



Although it is the rule to cook macaroni in plenty 
of fast-boiling water, I often throw a large handful 
of it (not previously boiled) into my homely soups 
and let it cook for an hour or two. It seems to become 
beautifully tender and to show its best flavour when 
treated in this way. 



Macaroni and spaghetti make useful and cheap 
extensions for most grilled and braised meats ; and, 
after packing potted meat or some other stuffing into 
boiled shells or tubes of macaroni, you can produce a 
charming dish by finishing off the shells or tubes in 
good stock, in a moderate oven. 



234 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

Some of the most worthless grocers sell a macaroni 
of a dull grey colour, or of an unholy yellow of chemical 
origin. As I have been asked for the best way of 
treating these kinds of macaroni, I have pleasure in 
giving two alternative methods. You must either 
return them to the grocer and ask for your money 
back ; or throw them into the dustbin and make up 
your mind to go to good shops only in future. 



CHAPTER XIV 

SAVOURIES 

Nineteen hundred years ago the whole course of a 
Roman dinner was expressed by the phrase : " Fiam 
the eggs to the apples." My memory is bad, but I 
believe that some modern playwright or novelist has 
given us a new version in the words: " 'Twixt the 
Soup and the Savoury." The Roman gourmets 
probably began their banquets with some kind of 
hors d'oeuvre, made from eggs, and wound up with 
fruit. The eggs were often the eggs of peahens, or 
they were commoner eggs formed into sausages on 
a foundation of minced and spiced meats. 



In these days many men have formed the habit of 
neglecting the fruit and of finishing dinner with a 
savoury. As most savouries are like hot hors d'oeuvre, 
the dinner of a twentieth-century gourmet may be 
compared with a musical composition, which satisfies 
the ear by beginning and ending in the same key. 
But, in a book devoted to the simplifying of our 
habits, I shall not expand upon merely toothsome 
savouries. I remember hearing a man say that, 
towards the end of a dinner, he usually felt that there 
was an odd corner of his interior still empty and that a 
savoury filled it very snugly. I have no sympathy 
with such a feeling. The idea that one must not rise 

235 

ERRATUM

for "Fiam" read "From" 



236 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

from the table until one cannot eat a scrap more is 
hateful in itself and deadly in practice. I shall there- 
fore mention only those reasonable and useful savouries 
which a housekeeper would be entitled to regard as 
part of the solid food with which to satisfy the reason- 
able hunger of those who sit at her table. 



This chapter can be short, because hints have 
already been given in the discursive chapter on 
sweets for the adapting of many entremets as 
savouries. And in the chapter on Hors d'OEuvre 
suggestions were made which apply to savouries. 



Of all savouries which are entitled to be regarded as 
substantial parts of a nourishing meal, a Welsh rare- 
bit comes first. To make a good Welsh rarebit, I 
prefer a Cheshire cheese with a good crumb. The 
extremely smooth cheeses which many provision 
merchants sell as Cheddar are much less suitable . Let 
the cheese be finely grated. Then let it be put into 
a saucepan with one tablespoonful of beer to two 
ounces of cheese. A little pepper and some made 
mustard should be stirred into the cheese and beer 
over the fire or stove. The stirring must never cease 
until the cheese becomes quite smooth and begins to 
thicken in the pan. A yolk of an egg, worked in at 
the last moment, is a great improvement. The cheese 
ought to be spread on strips of buttered toast, toasted 
at the last minute. 

The beer does not taste like itself after being cooked 
in this way. I may say, however, for those who 



SAVOURIES 237 

object to beer on conscientious grounds, that milk can 
be used instead, although the Welsh rarebit will not be 
so satisfactory. 

For a change, but rarely, I have used the white of 
egg (which was left on my hands after mixing in the 
yolk) b}^ poaching it and spreading it on the buttered 
toast, just below the cheese. I call this a Chester 
Rarebit, not because it is known in Chester but in 
memory of many a grand cheese which I have helped 
to eat on the banks of the Dee. Of course a poached 
egg on top of the cheese is a well-known addition to a 
Welsh Rarebit which thereby becomes a Buck Rarebit. 



A Souffle au Parmesan is served with pride at many 
a highly ceremonious dinner. Yet it is neither costly 
nor very difficult to make. When eggs are at their 
cheapest, I have provided a Souffle au Parmesan at a 
cost of about twopence the portion. As it took the 
place of sweets and cheese, it could not be called a wild 
extravagance. 

A buttered souffle dish must first be prepared. 
Many cooks use small souffle dishes according to the 
number of guests, but this is a wasteful plan, as some 
persons barely taste the souffle while others want a 
second helping. If you do not possess a regular 
souffle dish, use the thinnest of your fireproof basins 
or even a cake-tin. 

Grate up an ounce and a half of Cheddar or Cheshire 
cheese with the same quantity of Parmesan. Many 
amateurs use Parmesan only, with displeasing results. 
Take a small saucepan and melt in it an ounce of 
butter with half-an-ounce of flour. Stir them well 



238 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

together and pour in a gill of milk, stirring vigorously 
until the mixture, so to speak, comes together and 
almost shrinks from the sides of the pan. Lift the pan 
off the fire, and put in the grated cheese, with salt and 
pepper. Next, beat in thoroughly the yolk of an egg. 
As soon as this first yolk is thoroughly incorporated 
v^ath the mixture, repeat the process with a second 
yolk. Somebody should be at hand, if possible, 
whisking the whites of the two eggs you have used 
and also the white of a third egg as stiffly as possible. 
Add the froth of egg-whites to the mixture and give 
it a light and rapid stirring, but do not waste time or 
allow the frothing to subside. Pour the mixture into 
the souffle dish, which should not be more than half 
filled, and put the dish in a rather hot oven. The 
souffle will rise up splendidly above the rim of the 
dish, and, while remaining ethereally dehcate within, 
will show a handsome brown crusting on the outside. 
It must be served instantly on very hot plates. 



A great group of savouries is comprised under the 
name of canapes. Many of these require special 
purchases of material and I shall therefore pass them 
over, with the exception of one which I have often 
made cheaply but to the great satisfaction of those who 
have eaten it on cold nights. I buy a large tin of 
cheap Portuguese sardines. With an ordinary fish 
knife and fork I open the fish lengthwise and lift out 
the bones, aU in one operation. Of course I cut off 
the tail. Should the skin be coarse, it is easy to re- 
move this also. With a wooden pestle I pound the 
flesh of the sardines in a bowl and then season the mass 



SAVOURIES 239 

with salt, grey pepper, a pinch of cayenne, a little 
Worcestershire sauce and perhaps some drops of any 
other suitable sauce which I may have at hand. 
Finally I pour the oil from the tin into the bowl, with 
some lemon juice, and work everything together by 
means of two fish forks. I make some rather large 
and thick squares of toast, using a loaf of light and 
open crumb and taking care not to overdo the toasting. 
After spreading each square liberally with the paste, to 
a thickness of about a third of an inch or even more, 
I swiftly finish off the savoury under a salamandre 
or deflector. Sometimes I chop finely a little mango 
chutney and work it into the mixture. Indeed this 
savoury is flexible in design, and all kinds of things 
can be used up in it, including tiny choppings of 
cooked vegetables and flakes of cold fish. 

Since the War began, a lady to whom I gave the fore- 
going recipe has applied it intelligently and success- 
fully to herrings. At a decent grocery she bought for 
fivepence halfpenny a tin of herrings in tomato sauce. 
The brand was a reputable one and yet the tin was 
quite large. After the bones had been removed, the 
herrings were pounded in their own sauce and a small 
quantity of newly melted butter was added, with 
proper seasonings. I did not taste the savoury my- 
self, but those who ate it were persons of ordinary 
fastidiousness and they are said to have been delighted. 
The squares were large and the quantity of fish on 
each was lavish, but the cost worked out at not much 
more than a penny a head. 



Herring roes on toast are cheap and good savouries, 



240 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

but they are not liked by everybody, and are only safe 
when you know the tastes of those for whom you are 
providing. 



Potted meat and potted fish on toast go well. A 
cook with a good palate and with a knowledge, 
instinctive or acquired, for combinations, may vary 
the potted meat and the potted fish in scores of ways, 
sometimes moistening them with remains of sauces, 
sometimes pounding in vegetables with them, some- 
times chopping up and adding pickles, sometimes 
finishing off the whole savoury au gratin with a top 
dressing of breadcrumb and butter and grated 
cheese. 



I repeat in this place the suggestion that little tart- 
cases of short crust can be filled with many things 
besides the familiar jam and lemon-cheese. Pastes of 
fish or meat or vegetables suit the short crust admir- 
ably, as everybody knows who has eaten a good home- 
made sausage-roll. I had occasion not long ago to 
buy a bottle of fonds d'artichauts and could use only 
a few of them with my tournedos. I disposed of the 
rest in little tart crusts which almost exactly fitted 
the fonds d'artichauts. Each fond rested on a little 
bed of potted meat and cooked cauliflower. The meat 
and cauliflower were well pounded together, but the 
fond, of course, was left entire. Hardly anybody will 
need telling that I did not serve these tartlets at the 
meal in which the tournedos and artichokes figured 
prominently. [The fonds were not flabby.] 



SAVOURIES 241 

Some men are selfish enough to expect savouries 
which force the cook to begin very delicate operations 
when she has already served a troublesome dinner. 
They ought not to be encouraged. Nor should 
regular indulgence be shown towards those who are 
bent upon ruining their palates with snack savouries 
all on fire with curry or cayenne and anchovy. True 
hospitality is shown more in giving people what they 
ought to have than in pampering them with what they 
think they want. 



CHAPTER XV 

THE TABLE 

No dish is completely successful until it has been 
found so by the man who eats it. Many a cook 
achieves a triumph of cookery in the kitchen, only to 
be speedily and bitterly disappointed by the news 
that nobody at the table thought much of her per- 
formance. In great houses this disaster is often due 
to the stupidity or laziness or spite of the butler or of 
the maids who wait at table ; but in small estabhsh- 
ments it should never occur. A housekeeper, when 
designing a meal, should count the cost, not only in 
money but in labour. I have seen very clever little 
menus planned out, which have broken down through 
some shortage of utensils or through insufficient 
hands to serve the food smartly. The model house- 
wife will take care that she has not only the fish and 
vegetables and meat demanded by her menu, but 
the glass and china and silver as well ; and she will be 
equally prudent concerning the strain on herself and 
on her servants. 



Throughout this book I have kept in mind the case 
of the housekeeper who may be sometimes single- 
handed, except for unskilled help in the rougher work 
of the kitchen. I will continue to deal with such cases. 
First, I recommend that no luncheon or dinner should 

242 



THE TABLE 243 

include more than one dish of the kind which requires 
a good deal of attention at the last minute. It would 
be great folly, for instance, to arrange for a soup 
which requires sippets of toast, and a fish which 
demands a sauce reduced from its own liquor, and a 
roast bird with the full accompaniment of sauce and 
breadcrumb and gravy, and a salad, and a sweet 
covered with a newly frothed white of egg, all in the 
same meal. With ordinary foresight, even a rather 
long dinner can be so chosen as to run quite smoothly. 
An electrical hot-plate does not cost much and it 
enables wonders to be performed ; indeed, with a 
hot-plate the hostess who is a single-handed cook 
will not need to leave the room from the hors d'oeuvre 
to the almonds and raisins. But prudence will make 
up for the hot-plate till you can buy it. 



You will never regi'et a few modest purchases of 
special pottery and china, such as little white dishes 
for poached or scrambled eggs, crescent-shaped salad 
plates, and tiny casseroles, with lids, in which each 
person can have his own portion of petits pois a la 
Frangaise or any similar dainty. At a total expense 
of not more than half-a-sovereign I have gradually 
brought together two or three dozen quaint little 
jugs for custards and oddly shaped plates and bowls 
and jars which make all the difference at table. 
Most of these I have bought from costers' barrows, 
and some of them were picked up at a copper or two 
apiece in Portugal and in Spain and at village fairs in 
France and Italy. When these things are not in use, 
they make a handsome show on shelves in the dining- 



244 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

room where they reflect the firehght and the candle- 
light bravely. 



The finest table-linen is not necessary every day 
in the year. A good plan is to have a rather long 
dining-room table, not quite three feet wide, and to 
cover it with a long strip of coarse washable material 
in golden-brown or blue, with hemmed napkins made 
from the same stuff. I am out of my depth in speaking 
of textile fabrics, but I think I mean a sort of soft 
" crash." Instead of having half-a-dozen sets of 
cloths and napldns aU alike, the colours can be varied 
to suit the flowers and foliage and special crockery 
which will be displayed upon them. Candlesticks, 
with a safe mechanism against the guttering of the 
candles and the burning of the shades, are also well 
worth the smaU sum they cost. Last winter I fitted 
the right mechanism into some empty Benedictine 
bottles and used them repeatedly at table. The 
bottles were twined with vine leaves, or ivy, or sprays 
of autmnn leaves, and had a fine sturdy look in con- 
trast with the white candles. Under soft lights many 
a very cheap fish or entree on its piece of homely 
pottery looks more tempting than food costing ten 
times as much served in a broad glare on expensive 
china. 



The writing of a simple menu means very little 
trouble, and, when the meal is over, the menu may 
be kept for reference and will often be found useful. 
When a hostess does not like the idea of a menu 



THE TABLE 245 

because it seems too formal, she ought to tell her guests 
or her family in a simple and matter-of-course way 
what dishes are about to be served. Now that dinners 
are becoming less stereotyped, these written or spoken 
announcements are more necessary than ever. It is 
unpleasant for everybody when sweets suddenly greet 
the hungry gaze of a man who has eaten the entree 
sparingly because he expected a roast to follow ; and 
it is no less unpleasant to find that you have eaten 
heartily of what you thought was the principal dish 
when all the time something still more important 
has been provided. The best hostess of my acquaint- 
ance always begins dinner by some such speech as 
this : " There is nothing for you but a vegetable soup 
made from sixteen different vegetables out of my own 
garden ; a sole in white wine ; two chickens in the 
Kentucky way, with a hot corn pudding ; a bit of old 
Cheshire cheese ; and the fruit which you see in the 
middle of the table. We are going to drink some 
Brauneberger, 191 1, and some Red Graves, 1907, 
and a glass of Tawny Port with the cheese." The 
guests know that each item in this short menu will 
be brought to the table in liberal quantities and that 
they may pass by anything that does not suit them 
and freely take a second large helping of what they 
like best. 



These frequent references to hostesses and guests 
may seem out of place in a book about homely meals. 
They apply, however, to purely family life as well as 
to formal dinners and luncheons. A man who never 
shaves except when he is going to meet strangers 



246 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

ought to be poorly thought of by his wife ; and the 
wife who makes an enormous difference between 
passing guests and her own family is equally deserving 
of censure. " Feed the Brute " is supposed to be 
merely a jocularity ; but there are too many houses 
where the ordinary meals must be called feeding-times 
rather than dinners. This is a sin not only against 
civilisation but against economy. When the pleasures 
of the table are concentrated in the single pleasure 
of sating a good appetite with succulent and tooth- 
some food, the eater naturally eats as much as he can 
put away. The true pleasures of the table, however, 
include delights for the eyes and the mind. Refine- 
ment is the enemy of gluttony. Housekeepers who 
grudge a few shillings for candlesticks, and a few 
pence for flowers, must often disburse many times the 
total of these savings to buy extra ounces of fish and 
meat and sweet things. Take cheese, for example. 
At a rough family dinner, the men cut and eat the 
cheese as one cuts and eats it at a wayside inn after 
three or four hours of tramping ; but at a delicately 
served dinner one-fourth the quantity is sufficient. 



I must not shirk the question of Wine. Speaking 
for myself, I hate alcoholic excess with all the heat 
and force of my soul, and I should be glad to see the 
consumption of ardent spirits cut down to one-twelfth 
its present volume. At the same time I am convinced 
that the moderate use of cheap, light, pure wines at 
luncheon and dinner is desirable in the highest degree. 
When all is said and done, the everyday cuisine of 
France is the best in the world, and this cuisine pre- 



THE TABLE 247 

supposes an accompaniment of simple table wines. 
In a Yorkshire town I was once invited to the evening 
meal in the house of a wealthy manufacturer. At one 
end of the table there was a whole salmon ; at the 
other, two boiled chickens smothered with white sauce. 
I have rarely met a finer salmon or more flavoury 
chickens ; but, instead of well-chilled Chablis or 
Hock or Moselle, we drank tea and cream with the 
fish, and, instead of Medoc or St Emilion or Beaujolais 
with the birds, we drank the second brew of tea and 
more cream. Later in the evening, the men warded 
off trouble by helping themselves liberally to whisky- 
and-soda, while the ladies turned over the pages of a 
religious weekly and lingered fondly upon an illus- 
trated advertisement of a cure for indigestion. Such 
habits are very wrong. 

Wine is barred in many households through incorrect 
estimates of the expense. Now it is quite true that 
wine is much dearer than tea ; and if any reader 
of this book prefers " high tea " to a civilised dinner, 
I can only bow my head in wonder and let that reader 
pass me by. But I have a word to say to those of 
sounder tastes. Wine is not so very dear after all. 
I have noticed that where wine is omitted all kinds 
of little extra solaces are forthcoming, and these often 
cost as much as the wine. By the time one has paid 
for lime juice and soda, or for ginger ale, and for the 
sweet biscuits or tiny cakes or chocolates that are 
produced to atone for the austerity of the beverages, 
no money has really been saved. 

Sound red and white wines from France and Spain 
and Portugal and Italy and Algiers can be bought at 
prices ranging upwards from elevenpence a bottle, 



248 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

A bottle of wine looks dearer than a bottle of beer, but 
it goes much further. Again, beer is usually gulped 
more than wine, and is often the ally of practices 
which lead to indigestion. When a liberal supply of 
a cheap drink is at his elbow, many a man is tempted 
to " wash down," as the ugly phrase goes, his food 
therewith, instead of masticating it thoroughly. As 
wine is served in smaller and more significant glasses, 
it is treated more respectfully, while its greater variety 
of flavours and colours and aromas as compared with 
those in malt liquors causes wine to be more deliber- 
ately and attentively consumed. So I say once more 
that wine is not so very dear after all. 

I do not recommend the strong wines which grocers 
sell in screw-stoppered flagons. These powerful juices 
are said to have the merit of remaining good for many 
days after the stopper is first unscrewed ; but their 
durability is too often attributable to some artificiality, 
such as fortifying or sterilising. All the same, I must 
recognise the fact that a bottle, or even half-a-bottle 
of wine, is not entirely consumed at one meal in every 
household, and I therefore recommend a simple way 
of getting out of the difficulty. Keep in the house a 
few clean bottles in half or quarter sizes. When you 
draw a cork before dinner, fill a half or quarter bottle 
with the wine which you do not propose to drink that 
day. Push in a good soft cork and put the surplus 
wine in a cold place if it be white, or in a warmer spot 
if it be red. On the morrow, or even some days later, 
the second portion will be nearly as good as the first. 
This advice does not apply fully to the more highly bred 
French and German table wines, but it is true of cheap 
Burgundy, Claret, Graves, Sauternes and Chablis. 



THE TABLE 249 

A bottle of some cheap but authentic dessert wine, 
such as a Marsala, at about eighteenpence a bottle, 
shows full value for the money it costs. A quite 
small glass of Marsala with the nuts will round off a 
simple dinner admirably, and this wine is also useful 
in cookery. I have referred once or twice, in earlier 
chapters, to the use I have made of Marsala when 
improvising tasty dishes out of chance materials. 

Rum for omelettes, and Kirsch and Cura9ao and 
Maraschino for macedoines of fruit, have their place 
in good housekeeping. We should be slow, however, 
to make much use of brandy except for the firing and 
saucing of the Christmas pudding. I used to know a 
mischievous matron who invariably included terribly 
drunken trifles and tipsy cakes in her menus when 
teetotallers came to dine. The teetotallers almost 
always took a large second helping, but, as they were 
mostly lifelong abstainers, of course they had no means 
of knowing why the stuff tasted so nice. Still, it was 
not right to give them a pleasure which they would 
have refused if they had known its origin. And, as a 
hostess cannot be sure that there will be no pledged 
abstainers at her table, she ought not to serve sweets 
like these. Further, they are not good in themselves. 
They enable a bad cook to take a short cut to favour, 
and they often combine badly with the rest of the 
dinner. 



^Next to wine, the best table drink is good Cider. 
I do not mean the aerated and sweetened cider, which 
is one of the most deadly beverages in the world, 



250 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

but the much cheaper and absolutely natural juice 
of the apple, weU fermented and bottled without the 
addition of water or sugar or gas. , 



Good, cold, fresh water is a drink which every reader 
ought to try, if he has not done so already. It pours 
well out of the rough jugs which the quarrymen of 
the Isle of Purbeck make in winter, and is worthy 
of good tumblers or thin glasses. This drink is less 
popular than it ought to be, largely because one gets 
it for practically nothing, and very little trouble is 
taken to serve it in perfection. Added to cheap and 
undistinguished wine, it goes down well and seems 
to take the coarseness of the wine away ; but it is 
the enemy of fine wines and must never be mixed with 
them. As for ice, one should be shy of putting it in 
drinking water. When very cold water is wanted, 
let the water-jug stand in a pail of ice until it is 
thoroughly chilled. 

Lemonade freshly prepared from fresh lemons and 
not excessively sweetened is a good drink. So is 
barley water. As for the very cheap large bottles of 
so-called mineral waters which are hawked round the 
suburbs, it is obvious that they can rarely be satis- 
factory. Natural mineral waters are often good, but 
rarely so good as the vendors would have us believe, 
considering that they are almost as dear as cheap wine. 

Although many people refuse it at night, because it 
keeps them awake, good coffee should be available 



THE TABLE 251 

at the end of most dinners and all luncheons. I say 
good coffee. Although the English amaze French 
housewives by their open-handedness with butter and 
cream and prime cuts of meat, they are niggardly in 
comparison with the French when it is a question of 
black coffee. For half-a-pint of black coffee it is 
necessary to use not less than three heaped-up tea- 
spoonfuls of coffee, freshly ground. Several experi- 
mental purchases may be necessary before you hit 
upon the blend that suits you best, but I may say that 
there is no need to pay a very high price. I think 
you can do as well for a florin as for half-a-crown, 
if you will persevere in the search. The blend should 
be bought in berries. A small coffee-mill and a French 
coffee-pot are best bought where you buy the coffee 
itself, and when you go to buy them, you should ask 
the coffee merchant for the best advice he can give 
you. Always remember that you ought to use twice 
as much coffee for the morning coffee as for coffee 
at luncheon or dinner, because you will dilute the 
morning coffee with milk ; a little chicory improves 
caf6 au lait. 

If you find that you have made too much coffee, 
you can pour the surplus into a bottle, cork it well, 
and use it next day ; but do not let anybody persuade 
you into the false economy of trying to use the coffee- 
grounds over again. 

Frown upon liqueurs. 

One more economy. If any muffish and self- 
indulgent young bachelor has formed the habit of 



252 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

dropping in to dine with you, do not hesitate to say 
that you suppose he will soon be coming round to bid 
you good-bye and that he must be sure to look you 
up the moment the War is over. In this way you will 
save money, while Lord Kitchener will gain a creature 
who may, some day, be turned into a man. 



CHAPTER XVI 

SOME BOOKS : AND A BOOK 

I THINK it was Sir Thomas Browne who said that 
the man who will do the most with books is the man 
who would have done the most without them. This 
is emphatically true of cooks and cookery-books. The 
men and women who turn cookery-books to the most 
profitable account are those who would make a fairly 
good show, simply through their common-sense and 
carefulness, even if every cookery-book in the world 
were burnt and scattered to the winds. 



I am about to mention a few works on cookery ; but 
it is to be understood that I do not put forward my 
short list with any thought of disparaging the scores 
of excellent manuals which are not named in it. 
I shall confine myself to half-a-dozen of the books 
in my own culinary library, which is very small, 
except on the antiquarian and literary side. Some 
people are always buying cookery-books, especially 
such books as are merely written to sell. I find it 
best to use a few books only, each book expounding 
the doctrines and practices of a distinct school. When 
I am in doubt, I compare all the recipes for cooking 
the given materials, from the simplest to the most 
elaborate. One soon forms the habit of reading 
recipes as musicians read printed scores. A trained 

253 



254 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

musician does not need to sit down at the piano, but 
can inwardly hear the melodies and harmonies and 
rhythms of a composition which is put into his hands 
for the first time ; and, similarly, an intelligent and 
experienced cook can enjoy many a banquet of 
unfamihar dishes by simply giving his mind to the 
printed page. 



The cookery-book, or rather the work on cookery, 
which I prize most is "The Spirit of Cookery," by 
the late Dr Thudichum (London, 1895). This is not 
a book of recipes, but is a kind of grammar of the art. 
Unfortunately the learned and laborious author used 
too copiously terms and phrases which most readers 
will not easily interpret. Those who have not al- 
lowed their early Greek and Latin to fade from their 
minds will find delight in Dr Thudichum's admirably 
precise expressions. But everybody has not kept 
up his classical studies, and I fear that my mention of 
"The Spirit of Cookery " must be regarded more as 
a tribute to the memory of an underrated man than 
as a recommendation of his book to practising cooks. 



Passing over a bundle of ill-printed little books 
which I have bought in small towns abroad, I must 
name the big tome of Jules Gouff^ called '' Le Livre 
de Cuisine." The first edition of this work is now 
nearly fifty years old, and I am therefore glad to 
possess a revision published early in the twentieth 
century. Gouffe divides his book into " Cookery 
for the Household " and '' Grand Cookery." He 



SOME BOOKS: AND A BOOK 255 

expects the reader to take the work of the kitchen 
seriously, and many of his recipes would be useless 
to the cook who has not thoroughly mastered the 
first principles. Indeed I cannot advise the ordinary 
housekeeper to spend money and time on French 
works of this class, as it is necessary to learn almost a 
new kind of French — and a very ugly kind — in order 
to read them with profit. The fat volumes of Urbain- 
Dubois are easier for an Englishwoman to use. One 
may leave on one side the expensive work, " La Cuisine 
Classique," but " La Cuisine d'aujourd'hui " and " La 
Cuisine de tous les Pays " are well worth having. 



About twenty-five years ago a French lady living 
in England lectured and wrote under the name of 
" Cordon Bleu." Her book, called " French Cookery 
for Ladies," is unfortunately composed upon an 
inconvenient plan, but its practical value is high. 
The little volume abounds in hints which the more 
solemn French writers do not give, because they think 
nobody needs them. "Cordon Bleu" perceived 
that the common kitchen-lore of France was little 
known in England, and her writings are valuable 
chiefly because she bridges the gap. 



Colonel Kenney-Herbert, whose earlier books were 
sent out under the pseudonym of " Wyvern," began 
his important contributions to the literature of the 
kitchen with a book called " Culinary Jottings for 
Madras." On his return to England he followed up 
his Anglo-Indian cookery-book by a series of small 



256 HOME COOKERY IN, WAR-TIME 

publications and finished his work with " Common- 
sense Cookery for EngUsh Households " (London, 
1894, and later editions). " Common-sense Cookery " 
costs six shillings, and I recommend it strongly to the 
student who is independent enough to pick and choose 
among its generally excellent contents. In my own 
little practice I differ, however, from " Wyvern " 
in one important respect. He attempts to state the 
proportions of all the ingredients in his recipes with 
an exactitude which a medical man could hardly 
surpass in writing a prescription for a dying patient. 
When he was himself learning to cook, " Wyvern " 
was often maddened by instructions to " add a 
little " of this or that, and he made up his mind that 
his own pages should be free from such tantalising 
vagueness. Up to a certain point he was right. 
Whenever it is possible to write a recipe precisely, an 
author is bound to see that precision is achieved. 
I have myself, in an earlier chapter, reproached 
Sir Henry Thompson for speaking of " a sufficient 
quantity of baking powder " in an otherwise exact 
recipe. [Sir Henry Thompson, whose book I have 
already commended, was a medical man as well as a 
surgeon, and he knew that the baking powder which 
he recommended had a fixed composition.] Speaking 
broadly, however, it is impossible to set down in cold 
print the exact weight or measure of every solid or 
liquid constituent of a dish. Salt, pepper, herbs, 
vinegar, sugar and nearly all other common ingredients 
are of widely varying savour, warmth, piquancy, 
sharpness, sweetness. An ounce of butter and a gill 
of milk from one dairy will be rarely be found to have 
just the same richness as equal quantities of the same 



SOME BOOKS : AND A BOOK 257 

products from another. Even common white flour 
varies considerably in its characteristics. When we 
come to stocks and sauces we perceive at once that, 
until such preparations are standardised, it is worse 
than idle to measure them out like liquid drugs as 
regulated by the pharmacopoeia. Vegetables, eggs, 
meat, fish are equally variable. One mushroom 
differs from another mushroom in glory. One cooking 
apple from the tree in the middle may be worth two 
apples from the tree on the right or only half-an-apple 
from the tree on the left. And not only are the 
materials erratic, but their carrying power often varies 
with the weather, as everybody knows who makes his 
own mayonnaise. 

" Wyvern " gave one reason for his meticulous 
recipes which I am bound to discuss. He held that 
cooks must be furnished with exact directions so that 
they could have no excuse for the unclean practice 
of tasting a mixture and then stirring it with the same 
spoon. In unison with all my readers, I abhor such a 
dirty habit and, if I had not been assured by house- 
keepers that it prevails in many kitchens, I should be 
disposed to treat it as almost non-existent. There is, 
however, a remedy much simpler than " Wyvern's." 
Every clean and decent cook keeps at hand a jug or 
a basin or a large cup that is not easily overturned, 
and, having filled the vessel with hot water, she 
places her spoon therein. When the time comes for 
tasting, she transfers a half-spoonful of soup to a tea- 
cup, or a dab of sauce to a saucer, or a morsel from 
a ragout to a small plate. The spoon goes back 
immediately into the hot water, while the cold cup or 
plate quickly chills the liquid or solid enough for it 



258 HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

to be tasted, I maintain that every good cook is 
bound to taste the larger number of dishes which she 
prepares, there being few exceptions outside roasts 
and grills and pastry and puddings. 

There is another reason why tasting is necessary 
in home cookery. Home, Sweet Home, is trying to 
the temper, and one is often thankful for the truth 
expressed in the beautiful song which declares that 
there is no place like it. Still, the Home is better 
than the Hotel, because its inhabitants can attain in it 
a closer adjustment of their little fads and weaknesses, 
and aches and pains. When a French chef in a 
restaurant kitchen sends upstairs a classical dish, he 
deserves no great credit for having produced it with 
hardly any tasting during the act of cooking ; simply 
because a classical dish is of fixed constitution and 
the customer who does not feel in the mood for it can 
choose something else instead. In Home Cookery, 
however, a good housekeeper bears in mind the 
peculiarities of those for whom she is providing. 
There are many people, for instance, who would 
enjoy certain wholesome sweets if the sweetening 
were less lavishly introduced than is usual. A little 
while ago I ordered a Pouding Soufil^ aux Marrons 
for a small dinner where only men were present. It 
looked so much like a vanilla soufil6 that almost 
everybody refused it ; but, after an explanation had 
been made, the men ventured upon tiny portions 
and were delighted with the result. The pudding 
had been made with hardly any sweetening and 
it would have been better still with none at all. 
This was at home. A week later I gave similar 
directions at a restaurant and the result was a 



SOME BOOKS: AND A BOOK 259 

failure, because the entremetier did not know our 
palates. 

Again, the perfect housekeeper will remember the 
state of health of her charge or charges. I have in 
mind the case of a man who has been accustomed for 
nearly thirty years to eat in restaurants of the first 
class. After a serious illness he finds himself unable 
to stomach dishes into which cooked butter enters ; 
yet he has a detestation of invalid diet and plain 
cookery. His case is not a rare one and it should not 
be beyond the skill of a resourceful cook to deal with 
it. But, in such circumstances, one must begin by 
breaking away from the exact prescriptions in printed 
manuals, and must correct one's subsequent innova- 
tions by tasting. 

Tasting is not as simple as it sounds. A good cook 
must learn to rise above her personal likes and dislikes, 
just as a tea-taster or a wine-taster learns to judge 
tea or wine for the suiting of palates other than his own. 
Many a conscientious cook in an English kitchen, 
who has worked her way up from the position of a 
scullery-maid, wonders why her best efforts fail to 
please certain guests. Through her tears she will 
sometimes protest to the parlourmaid that she " had 
some of it " herself and that " it was beautiful." 
The trouble is that she has tested her work by the 
palate of a woman and of a peasant, making no 
allowance for enormous differences of physique and 
education. I am not alluding to the cruder faults, but 
to the innimierable little touches and fine shades which 
accumulate into all the difference between good and 
bad cookery. Where the art of tasting has not been 
acquired, I prefer the methods of "Wyvern" after all. 



26o HOME COOKERY IN WAR-TIME 

After beginning to write this book, I met with a very 
fat volume caUed "Cookery for Every Household," 
by Florence B. Jack. I took a slight dislike to it, as it 
had the appearance of having been bulked out on 
artful paper so as to seem marvellous value for three 
and sixpence. I found, however, that it was an 
excellent book; indeed it would be difficult to name 
a more suitable volume for daily use. The recipes 
are neither extravagant and complicated on the one 
hand, nor bald and rudimentary on the other. 

Space allows of my discussing only two more 
cookery-books. The first of them is " The Cookery- 
book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie." Lady Clark dis- 
pensed and received a great deal of hospitality in 
her long life, and she made it a rule to possess herself 
of the recipe for every dish which struck her fancy, 
either for its novelty or for its excellent rendering of 
familiar ideas. She filled sixteen books with directions 
which she had jotted down on envelopes or the backs 
of menus or any other scraps of paper that were at 
hand. After Lady Clark's death the recipes were 
carefully classified and printed in a six-shilling volume 
which nobody will regret bu3dng. At a first glance, 
it may seem that the book is even better than it is. 
One opens it with bright hopes of finding in it the 
masterpieces of all schools, but one gradually perceives 
that the tastes of Lady Clark and her husband 
largely dominated the choice of dishes to be described. 
Still, it is a book to buy. 

The second of my last two books has not yet 



SOME BOOKS: AND A BOOK 261 

been printed. Perhaps it has not even begun to be 
written. I am thinking of the book which I want every 
reader of my own wretched little essay to set about 
compiling. These pages, in spite of their poverty, may 
at least stir up the disappointed reader to serious 
studies and experiments in the kitchen. If such 
should be my too rich reward, I beg each newly fired 
enthusiast to buy without delay a strongly bound 
book containing about five hundred blank leaves of 
good and durable writing-paper, with an aiphabetical 
index at the beginning or the end. And in this book 
let there be written down, one by one, every worthy 
recipe which has been successfully applied in the owner's 
own kitchen. Let notes abound, correcting my gross 
errors and the httle slips of better writers. Let a 
thousand odds and ends of market and kitchen and 
pantry and table wisdom be treasiured up and written 
down. Let any notable menu be transcribed into 
the book, with any quaint domestic happening, or 
episode of hospitality. And when this young century 
is old, and the War now raging is no more to our 
grandchildren than the campaigns of Wellington are 
to us ; when new men and new women have begun 
to eat new plants and new fruits with our familiar 
birds and beasts and fishes in new ways ; then who 
can say that the stout book with the five hundred 
leaves will not be counted more precious than any 
romance or poem of this generation ? So let the tome 
be bought to-day and let the writing begin to-morrow. 
This I crave in my vanity ; because thus, although 
I cannot myself write an endming book on cookery, 
I may at least have caused one to be written.
