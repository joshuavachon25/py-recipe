BREAD. 



O PART of home cookery requires as much skill as bread mak- 
ing. The art of making good bread can only be attained by 
patient care and watchfulness. It is not necessarily a difficult 
task ; yet I will venture to say that there are a large proportion of young 
American housekeepers who can make a good cake and prepare a 
delicious dessert, that cannot make a good loaf of bread. 

Bread making should be one of the first lessons taught. What is 
more conducive to conjugal quarrels than heavy, sour bread? No 
article of food is as essential as good bread. With good bread in the 
house no one need ever go hungry. No meal, no matter how much is 
prepared for it, is complete without it. Good wheat flour is the basis of 
good bread. The best flour is not of a pure white color, but has a 
creamy, yellowish white tinge. Never buy flour that looks blue white. 
If it feels clammy or forms in lumps it is not of the best. Good flour 
holds together in a mass and adheres to the hand ; and when squeezed 
retains the imprint of the fingers, and even the lines of the skin, longer 
than poor flour when made into dough. If good it will be elastic and 
take up a large quantity of water, and stay in shape longer. Poor 
flour will flatten and spread. Never use flour without sifting. Keep 
it in a dry, cool place and not a great quantity of any kind on hand, 
as it is very apt to become musty. There are two ways of making 
bread by fermentation, and bread made without fermentation. By 
fermentation we mean the setting free of carbonic gas, which spreads 
rapidly through the whole mass of dough, and causes it to rise by the 
rapid multiplication of new air cells upon those already formed. 
Yeast causes the process of fermentation. The cells in the yeast plant 
are very small and when the temperature is such as to cause them to 
grow rapidly, and coming in contact with any substance like dough, 
they increase so rapidly that the whole mixture is filled with them. 
Sour milk and soda cause the same process to take place. Baking 
powders cause the dough to rise quickly. The importance of having 
good yeast is readily seen . What is yeast ? Yeast is a plant or germ of 
the lowest order of vegetable growth. It contains numberless minute 
oval cells ; each cell contains a sap. They multiply by millions very 
rapidly. These are propagated in anything where they find congenial

tood. Grape juice in two hours' standing in a warm place will give off 
a froth of yeast cells. Bread made with yeast is much more porous, 
lighter, and pleasanter to the taste, and much more easily digested. 
Good bread should be of a light spongy texture, and to get this we al- 
low the bread, under the influence of the yeast, to expand as much as 
possible without becoming sour. Unfermented bread is made without 
yeast. The principle is the same, being the liberation of gas. The 
usual method is by some gas generating compound, as the union of 
soda and sour milk. When chemicals used are in such a proportion 
that they are neutralized and leave only Eochelle salt, this bread is 
harmless but not so palatable and digestable as yeast bread. The three 
essential elements of good bread are good yeast, the best flour and an 
even temperature. There are three kinds of yeast, any of them are 
good ; dry, compressed and liquid. Compressed yeast is only good 
when it can be obtained fresh. Potato yeast is the best, as bread made 
from it does not dry up so quickly and is sweeter and more nutritious. 
First set your sponge. This is made from warm water or milk, 
yeast and flour. If you do not use potato yeast, use the water in which 
the potatoes were cooked at dinner time, or add a few potatoes mashed 
and run through a sieve. In winter make the water or milk quite 
warm. In summer have it lukewarm. Do not sponge too early in 
the evening, as the sponge is apt to stand too long before it is mixed 
and kneaded. If compressed yeast is used (this is one of the most 
rapid forms of fermentation), sponge before breakfast. Use about 
one cup of liquid yeast to one quart of wetting. If compressed yeast 
is used, use one-half a cake to the same quantity. If milk is used, 
scald to prevent its souring. In winter warm the flour and all dishes 
used. Keep the temperature even ; about 75 degrees should be kept 
up during the entire process. Mix as soon as the sponge has risen to 
the proper point. You can tell this by its light, puffy appearance, the 
middle standing higher than the sides. If it looks fallen in the middle, 
it has stood too long. Knead well, and thoroughly for at least twenty 
minutes. This is very important. Knead until the mass of dough feels 
light, spongy and elastic under the hand. To knead the bread well 
requires strength and patience. A little sugar is necessary to bread, 
and if the bread is made of water, a little shortening of some kind. 
A word about the baking. This is one of the important parts of the 
whole process. The excellence of the bread is greatly dependent 
upon the perfection of the cells produced by the action of heat upon 
carbonic acid gas. The oven should be hot when the bread is put in. 
The heat should be of sufficient strength to last through the time of 
baking (which is always about one hour for an ordinary loaf of 

b

bread), without replenishing. It should increase at first, then 
diminish slowly toward the last. If the oven is too hot a hard brown 
crust will form and make the inside heavy. Do not remove before it 
is done or the mass will be heavy and raw inside. The dough should 
rise after fifteen minutes and brown slightly. Remove the loaves 
from the pans at once, as soon as the time is up, and place them 
where the air can circulate around freely. Turn the loaves out on a 
clean tea towel. Do not put away until cold, and then in a stone jar 
or a tin box. Keep the jar well covered to prevent the bread from 
drying. 

Potato Yeast 

Have three quarts of water boiling rapidly. Pare three raw 
potatoes, and let them soak awhile in cold water. Mix one- fourth of a 
cup of flour with one-fourth of a cup of sugar and one tablespoon of 
salt. Grate the potatoes, and add them to the flour, sugar and salt. 
Pour the boiling water on them. Pour part of it on the grater. 
Add water enough to make the yeast the consistency of thin starch. 
If this does not thicken cook awhile. Strain and cool. When luke- 
warm add one cup of yeast. Put in a warm place until the top is 
covered with bubbles. Beat it well. Cover tighly, and keep in a cool 
place. Add a little ginger ; it improves it, and helps to keep the 
yeast. 

Bread Sponge. 

Take three potatoes, boiled, and mashed while hot, and dissolved 
in one quart of warm water, or one quart of potato water. Into this 
stir three cups of flour, and six tablespoons of good yeast. Beat to a 
smooth batter. Set over night. In the morning add a tablespoon of 
white sugar, a large tablespoon of white lard or butter. Knead well 
for twenty minutes, and set to rise. Knead down once more, and 
when light mold into loaves, and let it rise again very light. In place 
of liquid yeast use one-half a cake of compressed yeast or dry yeast. 

Hop Yeast. 

Steep half |a cup of loose hops in one quart of boiling water five 
minutes. Mix one cup of flour, one-fourth of a cup of sugar, and one 
tablespoon of salt. Strain the hops and pour the liquor boiling on the 
flour. Boil a minute. Add a cup of yeast when cool, and put in a 
warm place to ferment. c

Milk Bread. 

Take one pint of milk, scalded and cooled. Put in a bowl, and 
add one tablespoon of butter, on tablespoon of sugar, one teaspoonful 
of salt. "When lukewarm add one-half a cup of liquid yeast or a small 
half a cake of compressed yeast, and six cups of flour. Let it rise. 
When light knead until very smooth and elastic. Let it rise again, and 
when light mold into loaves. When light bake in a steady oven an 
hour. The time of course depends on the size of the loaves. 

Rye Bread. 

Pour one pint of scalded milk on one tablespoonful each of butter 
and sugar, and one teaspoonfulof salt ; when lukewarm add half a cup 
of yeast. Stir in three cups of rye flour or rye meal. Beat well, let it 
rise over night ; in the morning add two cups of flour, and knead half a 
hour. Let it rise again, and mold into loaves and put to rise again ; 
let it rise the last time very light. 

Raised Brown Bread. 

Put one pint of cornmeal in a bowl and scald it with boiling water 
enough to wet it. Let it stand awhile, then add cold water enough 
to make a soft batter. Now add half a cup of yeast, one-half a cup of 
molasses, one-half a teaspoon of salt, and one saltspoon of soda, one 
pint of rye meal. Beat thoroughly and let the mixture rise over night ; 
in the morning stir it down and put it in a well greased tin ; let it rise 
again. Bake in a slow oven two hours.

soda, one of salt ; beat all together and bake in a dripping pan. A 
tablespoon of sugar improves it. 

Bean Bread. 

In the place of potatoes in bread reduce a pint of beans by boiling 
to a pulp. Extract the moisture and use the pulp in the sponge. Par- 
snips and sweet potatoes may be used in the same way. 

Salt Rising Bread. 

Take one pint of boiling water and a teaspoon of salt, when luke- 
warm stir in flour enough to make rather a stiff batter. Put it where 
it will be very warm overnight, in the morning set it in a kettle of very 
warm water, stir frequently, add half a teaspoon of soda dissolved in 
some warm water, stir well and leave to rise ; when the dish is nearly 
full put a quantity of flour in the bread pan, put in a quart of water, 
quite warm, stir in some of the flour and then the rising batter, cover 
this with flour an inch thick and put in a warm place ; when light make 
into loaves and put to rise again. Bake in a well heated oven nearly 
an hour. 

Vienna Bread. 

Take three pints of milk and water, teaspoon of salt, one cup of 
compressed yeast, two quarts of flour. Place the flour in a bread bowl, 
and put in the milk, water and salt. Make a thin batter. Add the 
yeast dissolved in a little lukewarm water. Beat well and cover the 
bowl and let it stand for three-quarters of an hour. At the end of that 
time mix in the rest of the flour. Let the dough stand for three hours 
until it is light and elastic. Cut into small pieces. Flatten these into 
squares, fold their corners to the center, pinch them down to hold them. 
Let them stand for ten minutes, turn them over again and let them 
stand a while longer. Put them in a hot oven. When they have risen, 
brush them with a sponge wet with milk, return to oven and finish 
baking. 

Squash Bread. 

One cup of squash stewed and sifted, one-half cup of sugar, two 
cups of scalded milk, teaspoon of salt, tablespoonful of butter, one-half 
cup of yeast or one-half cake of dry yeast. Mix squash, sugar and 
salt, add butter melted in hot milk, and when cool add yeast. Knead 
and let it rise very light. Mold into loaves and let it rise again. e

BREAKFAST AND TEA CAKES. 

[jJg\ISCUIT, muffins, griddle cakes, etc, are made with either sour or 
[gm sweet milk. Soda must be used with something containing an 
acid, and is neutralized with sour milk. Soda is used in the 
proportion of one even teaspoon to a pint of thick sour milk, or butter- 
milk. Always pulverize your soda on the board with a knife before 
measuring, and sift into the flour. Some dissolve it in the milk, but in 
doing this some of the gas escapes in the effervescence. When sweet 
milk is used, use either soda and cream of tartar or baking powder. 
Use one level teaspoonful of soda to two of cream of tartar, and one 
quart of flour. It requires a little more than twice as much cream of 
tartar to neutralize the soda. 

Use baking powder in the proportion of three rounding teaspoon- 
fuls to one quart of flour. Always sift it thoroughly in the flour, 
use only the best cream of tartar. The pure article can be obtained 
best at a drug store. Soda biscuit must be made as quickly as possible. 
Baking powder biscuit must be mixed very soft, and handled as little 
as is necessary to get them in shape to cut out. Biscuit must be put 
in a hot oven, then cool the oven off gradually after they have risen 
until done a light brown. Molasses gives another acid, and is used 
with soda alone. 

In making gems or muffins have your pans hot before pouring in 
the mixture. Waffles irons should be put on to heat when you com- 
mence to make your waffles. Grease on both sides with a cloth tied 
to the end of stick and used especially for this purpose. Lard or beef 
drippings are the best for greasing the irons. They require a longer 
time to bake than griddle cakes. Always sift your flour before meas- 
uring. In making rolls and raised biscuits, mold and set to rise two 
hours before baking. 

Sour Cream Biscuit. 

One quart of sifted flour, one even teaspoonful of salt, one even 
teaspoonful of soda, measured after it is pulverized, one pint of sour 
cream. If sweet cream is used, use with the soda two teaspoonfuls of 
cream of tartar. Sift soda and cream of tartar in the flour. Mix with 
the hands as little as possible. f

ATHER materials together, and have your table cleared of 
everything else. Put your butter where it will warm, but not 
melt. Eggs should be placed in the ice chest to cool so as to 
beat well. Always use the best butter for cake, as heat developes all 
its bad qualities. Have your sugar fine. First cream your butter and 
sugar, then add eggs beaten very light, then milk, and lastly Hour and 
flavoring. Always sift the flour before measuring. If baking powder is 
used sift in the flour previously measured. If cream of tartar and soda 
are used, dissolve soda in the milk and sift cream tartar in the flour. 
Remember two things, sour milk makes light spongy cake, and soda 
should always be used with it. Sweet milk makes a firmer cake, and 
baking powder or cream tartar and soda should be used. Any light 
cake is improved by beating the whites to a stiff froth, and the yolks 
very light. The whites are stirred in the flour the last thing. In 
sponge cake the eggs must always be beaten separately and the flour 
sifted very light. Do not stir your mixture, but beat thoroughly, 
bringing the batter up from the bottom of the dish at each stroke. 
Use an earthen bowl in preference to tin. Use the same cup always 
for measuring. Those little tin ones with the halves and fourths 
marked are very handy. In fruit cake always seed your raisins by 
pouring boiling water on them. Cut your citron or candied fruit into 
small pieces. Always wash currants thoroughly and dry in a sieve. 
Brown your flour. Add fruit last thing well floured. 

The baking of the cake is of as much importance as the mixing. 
Let your oven be hot when you put your cake in, then keep it at an 
even temperature. Do not shake oven or open too often, as an 
unequal temperature will cause it to fall. Layer cakes require a brisk 
fire ; large cakes, a slow steady fire. In baking fruit cakes it is a 
good plan to put two or three thicknesses of well greased writing paper 
on the bottom of your pan. Molasses in dark cakes burns very 
quickly . 

To test your cake to see if it is done use a splinter from a new 
broom, or a steel knitting needle. If nothing adheres to them, or if 
the cake, as we say, has stopped " singing," it is done. Grease tins 
always with lard or cottosuet. If almonds are used blanch by pour-

CANDY. 



fN MAKING candy cook over a slow fire. Molasses candy and 
caramels scorch very quickly. Try by dropping a little in cold 
water. If it becomes brittle and snaps the candy is hard enough, 
or test by lifting the spoon, and if the mixture "hairs" or ropes from 
it, this is a good test that the candy is ready to be removed from the 
fire. Butter should be put in when the candy is nearly done, and all 
flavoring should be added just after removing from the fire. A little 
vinegar or cream of tartar will keep candy from graining. Baker's 
chocolate should never be allowed to boil, but melted by placing in 
a pan of hot water on the back of the stove. Never add any water 
to it. 

Cream Candy. 

Two cups of white sugar, one-half cup of water. Flavor with 
vanilla while pulling. Tablespoonful of vinegar. Cook until brittle 
when dropped in cold water. Cool and pull. Cut in small pieces 
with the shears. 

Cream and Chocolate Candy. 

Two cups of granulated sugar, one-half cup of water, one table- 
spoon of vinegar, one-half teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Flavor with 
vanilla. Take one-third of the cream and flavor with two tablespoons 
of grated chocolate. Pour into a mold in layers ; dark in center. Cut 
when partly cold into small cubes. 

Butter Scotch. 

Two cups of suger, three-quarters of a cup of vinegar, one-half 
cup of butter. Cook until brittle when dropped in water. Pour in 
buttered pans, and mark when nearly cold in small squares. 

Chocolate Caramels. 

One cup grated chocolate, two cups brown sugar, one cup of molas- 
ses, large piece of butter, pinch of soda when nearly done. Boil half 
an hour over a slow fire, as it burns very quickly. Pour in pans, and 
mark in squares when nearly cold. z 

Chap-O-Lene will positively cure chapped or rough skin. 



COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. 37 

Chocolate Drops. 

Two and a half cups sugar, one-half cup of water, a pinch of cream 
of tartar. Boil four minutes, and beat until cold enough to roll into 
balls with the fingers. Take one-half cake of Baker's chocolate, melt 
and roll the drops in it, and set them on greased paper to dry. 
Flavor cream with lemon or vanilla. 

Walnut Creams. 

Take the above recipe. Make a small ball, and press a walnut 
meat on both sides, or in place of a walnut use a date. 

Almond Macaroons. 

Blanch and pound half a pound of almonds to a smooth paste, add 
a pound of sugar and the whites of three eggs. Work all together. 
Roll into balls and lay on buttered paper one inch apart. Put in a 
cool oven three-quarters of an hour. 

Molasses Candy. 

Two cups Orleans molasses, one cup brown sugar, one tablespoon- 
ful of vinegar, piece of butter size of a walnut. Boil until brittle in 
water. Cool and pull until gold color. Clip off with the shears into 
pieces an inch long. Flavor the last thing, and add a pinch of soda 
just before removing from the fire. 

Hickory Nut Candy. 

Take recipe for molasses candy, and add, just before removing 
from the fire, one cup of nut meats. Cool in a buttered pan and break 
up in pieces. Peanuts can be used in place of hickory nut meats. 

Lemon Candy. 

Take a pound of white sugar, large cup of water. Cook half an 
hour. Raise spoon, and if it hairs, as we say, it is done. Squeeze in 
the juice of part of a lemon or a little vinegar and lemon extract. 
Pour in a tin and mark in squares before it is hard. 

Cocoanut Drops. 

One cup of powdered sugar, white of an egg, cup of grated or 
dessicated cocoanut. Roll into little balls and bake on buttered pane. 

Nut Candy. 

Take the above recipe and pour in just before putting in the 
pans, chopped cocoanut, almonds, hickory nuts and slices of Brazilian 
nuts. la

Cocoanut Squares. 

One cocoanut grated fine, two cups of milk, butter size of an egg, 
three pounds of white sugar, two teaspoons of lemon essence. Boil 
slowly until stiff and pour in two well buttered pans. Mark in squares 
when partly cold. 

Hickory Nut Macaroons. 

One egg, half cup of flour, a cup of meats chopped fine, one cup 
of sugar. Make in balls and bake a few minutes in a slow oven. 

Confectionary Candy. 

Mix the whites of two eggs and their bulk in water with two pounds 
of confectionery sugar and a tablespoon of vanilla and lemon mixed. 
Beat well and you have the foundation for several kinds of candy. 
For chocolate drops roll into marbles and dip in melted Baker's choc- 
olate, and set up on greased papers to dry. Roll the balls in chopped 
nut meats or press a walnut on each side of a small piece of the paste 
and smooth off the rough edges with the fingers and you have a walnut 
candy. Sprinkle cocoanut on a layer of the paste, roll a little and cut in 
squares and cocoanut squares are the result. Figs and dates can be 
used the same as walnuts. This is at present a very popular, cheap 
and convenient way of making several kinds of candy. It should be 
eaten at once, as it dries very quickly. 

Marrous Glacis. 

Purchase large chestnuts, selecting them with great care. Shell 
and cover with boiling water and let them stand fifteen minutes. 
Remove the brown skin and cover them with boiling wate** and let 
them simmer thirty minutes. Make a syrup of one cup of granulated 
sugar and one cup of water, add the chestnuts and let them cook slowly 
until they begin to look clear. Take them out and let them stand one 
by one on a flat sieve over night. In the morning take one pound of 
granulated sugar and one cup of water, stir over a fire until the sugar 
is dissolved, boil until the syrup hairs and then add one teaspoonful of 
lemon juice, take from the fire and beat, dip the chestnuts in the mix- 
ture and put them on greased paper to dry. lb

CREAMS AND ICES. 



| VERY family should possess a good gallon ice cream freezer. A 
great many palatable dishes can be made with it in hot weather. 
The principla feature of making creams and ices is in the freez- 
ing. Itis essential to have the ice finely crushed. This can be done by 
first breaking it up into coarse pieces and putting it in a sack made of 
burlap or some coarse material and pounding with a wooden mallet or 
an ice cracker. Use one part salt to three parts of ice ; rock salt is the 
best, but coarse salt will do the work. Salt causes the ice to melt rap- 
idly and ice in changing to water absorbs a great deal of heat. This 
makes the mixture of ice and salt many degrees colder than the ice 
alone. The outlet to let out the water should be near the top of the 
eezer. Let it run out as the ice melts, do not drain it off. Put a 
layer of ice in the bottom of the freezer, then a layer of salt and so on 
until the freezer is full. Always have the ice come a few inches above 
the cream in the can. Let the cream or ice stand for eight or ten min- 
utes until chilled, turning occasionally, then rapidly and continuously 
until the crank begins to turn hard, and you can turn it no longer. It 
requires from twenty minutes to half an hour to freeze the mixture. 
Remove the beater and handle, pack down the cream, drain off some of 
the water, put in a fresh layer of ice and salt and cover with an old 
sack or piece of carpeting until ready to serve. Cream is better to 
stand an hour or so before serving. The cream can be removed from 
the can and packed in fancy shapes or molds ; cover the mold closely 
with a cloth and put the cover on carefully, then pack with fresh ice 
and salt in some large receptacle. Pour off the water, dip the mold 
quickly in hot water, turn out on a platter and serve at once. There are 
many ways of making cream. Cream is the essential element in the best 
ice cream, but good cream can be made without cream or by using part 
cream. 

Ices and sherbets are made of fruit juices, sugar and water. When 
made of fruit juice, water and sugar they are called ices. When the 
white of an egg or a little gelatine is added they are known as sherbets. 
When cordials or liquors are added to lemon and orange ices they are

called punches. When a variety of fruit is used the ice is known as 
macedoines. Sherbets half frozen are called sorbets. When fresh 
fruit cannot be obtained use the juice of canned fruit ; fresh fruit is of 
course the best. To make ices very rich the juice alone with sugar is 
used. Adding the white of an egg to a sherbet gives it a creamy consist- 
ency ; some use a spoonful of gelatine. To make the texture of the ice 
fine grained boil the sugar and water together ; remove the scum and 
strain. Always sweeten your creams and ices very sweet , more than 
would be agreeable if not frozen, for the intense coldness deadens the 
sense of the taste. When lemons are used, grate off some of the rind, 
squeeze out the juice and let them stand awhile ; this gets all the flavor 
of the lemon. Put in the sugar so as to let that dissolve at the same 
time, strain and prepare the ice for freezing. 

Keep the machinery of the freezer well oiled. Always scald out 
the can of the freezer before putting it away. Dry the freezer, and 
drain and dry the salt, as it can be used again. A substitute for a 
freezer is a covered tin pail placed in a wooden bucket : pack the space 
around the pail with the ice and salt. Remove cover and stir the cream 
from the sides occasionally until stiff. 

Plain Ice Cream. 

Boil one pint of milk and one pint of cream. Beat two eggs very 
light, add one cup of sugar, a little salt ; mix well, and add to the boil- 
ing milk. Turn into the double cooker and cook awhile. When cold 
add two tablespoons of any kind of flavoring. Add more sugar if neces- 
sary, and freeze according to directions given. 

Quick Ice Cream. 

One quart of cream, cup and a half of sugar, pinch of salt, and flavor 
to taste. Let the sugar stand in the cream awhile so as to dissolve. 
Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, put in the bottom of the can 
and pour in the cream. To make it nice reserve a part of the cream, 
whip it and add to the rest when it is partly frozen. It will take at least 
a large tablespoon of flavoring extract. 

Neapolitan Ice Cream. 

One quart of cream, four eggs, one cup of sugar, flavoring. Scald 
the cream, beat the yolks, add the sugar, and beat again. Beat whites 
stiff, and add them to the yolks. Pour in the cream and cook awhile in 
a double boiler. Strain, and when cold, add flavoring and freeze. 
With this recipe can be made any variety of cream. id

Chocolate Ice Cream. 

Take five tablespoons of grated chocolate, rub smooth in one pint 
of milk ; add two well beaten eggs and two cups of sugar. Beat well 
and cook in a double boiler until it thickens . When cold flavor with a 
teaspoon of vanilla. Put in a freezer, and when it begins to set add a 
quart of rich cream. A cup of preserved peaches cut in small pieces, 
and added when the cream is almost frozen, makes a delicious cream. 

Fruit Frappies. 

Line a fancy mold with any nice rich vanilla flavored cream. Fill 
the center with fresh berries, or peaches, apricots or pears cut in slices. 
Cover with ice cream. Put in a bucket and pack with ice and salt. 
Let it stand for an hour. Any kind of berries can be used. Straw- 
berries are the most delicious. If you have not fresh fruit use canned. 

Frozen Custard. 

Scald one quart of milk. Beat the yolks of four eggs, add one cup 
of sugar, pinch of salt, and beat well. Place in a double cooker, and 
cook until creamy. Cool and flavor to taste. This can be made much 
richer by adding a cup of cream when the custard is partly frozen. 

Lemon Ice Cream. 

Use any recipe for cream. Neapolitan ice cream is the best. Grate 
some of the rind of a lemon. Squeeze out the juice. Be careful not to 
have any of the rind and seeds, as they are apt to give a bitter flavor. 
Strain and mix with half a cup of sugar. Boil until clear, and stir into 
the cream just before freezing. 

Strawberry Ice Cream. 

Take one quart of strawberries and sprinkle a large cup of sugar 
over them. Mash, and let them stanct an hour. Put through a sieve 
as long as the juice and pulp will come. Put the pulp in a pan and 
pour on one cup of milk. Strain through a cloth. Add to this one 
quart of cream, and make it very sweet. Scald the cream and dissolve 
the sugar in it. The strawberries can be mashed and poured into a quick 
ice cream when it is partly frozen. Canned strawberries can be used 
in place of fresh ones. 

Raspberry Ice Cream. 

Make exactly as the above recipe says, using raspberries in place 
of strawberries. The juice of a lemon greatly improves it. Easpberries 
are apt to be too sweet. le 

fD^.Caswell'8 Pectoral Balsam is a pertect cougn cure. 



46 COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. 

Banana Ice Cream. 

Peel six ripe bananas, remove the dark seeds and the dark line in 
the centre. Rub the pulp through a strainer and add sugar to make it 
very sweet. A little lemon juice improves it. Add a pinch of salt, and 
put in any ice cream, made from the preceding recipes, when partly 
frozen, or make one as follows : One quart of cream, one cup of sugar 
and flavor to taste. Prepare as in quick ice cream. 

Peach Ice Cream. 

Take a dozen large, ripe freestone peaches, pare and chop ; add a 
few of the stone meats. Add large cup of sugar to the peaches and let 
them stand awhile. Wash the pulp through a sieve and stir in any 
kind of ice cream. The peaches can be used without putting them 
through a strainer. 

Apricot Ice Cream. 

Take a quart of apricots, add one cup of sugar and let them stand 
awhile ; then rub the pulp through a sieve. Scald one quart of ^ream 
and add one cup of sugar to it ; cool and put in a freezer. Add the 
beaten white of an egg and the apricot pulp. Freeze according to 
directions. 

Maraschino Ice Cream. 

Make a Neapolitan ice cream, flavor with vanilla and almond 
flavoring. When ready to serve pour three spoonfuls of maraschino 
over the cream. 

Pistachio Ice Cream. 

Shell, blanch and pound one-quarter of a pound of pistachio 
nuts, add half a cup of almond meats chopped and pounded to a 
paste. Make a plain ice cream or any kind, flavor with a teaspoonful 
of vanilla and almond mixed, and add the nuts and almonds. Freeze 
as usual. The nuts can be used alone without the almonds, or use the 
almonds alone and call it almond ice cream. Pistachio ice cream can 
be colored the desired shade by using spinach coloring. 

Tutti Frutti Ice Cream. 

Make a quick ice cream, flavor with a little Madeira or any rich 
wine. Take a mixture of candied fruit, using plums, cherries, pears, 
strawberries and apricots, about a pound in all. Cut up fine and add 
to the cream when partly frozen. if

Hickory Nut Ice Cream. 

Take a pint of hickory nut kernels, pick over carefully, pound in 
a mortar. Put two tablespoons of sugar over the fire without water, 
stir until browned ; add a little water to dissolve it, add it to the nuts. 
Take one quart of cream and sweeten one teacup and a half of ice 
cream, add the nut paste and freeze. 

New York Ice Cream. 

Take one quart of cream, one teacup and a half of sugar and a table- 
spoon of vanilla. Beat the yolks of six eggs and pour the boiling cream 
on them ; put over the fire for a minute. Freeze. This, molded with 
chocolate and lemon ice cream, is very nice. 

Nut Ice Cream. 

Take filberts, chestnuts or English walnuts ; American walnuts, 
hickory nuts and pecans can be used. Shell, blanch if necessary ; chop 
or pound to a paste, and stir in any plain ice cream. In using pecans 
avoid getting any of the puckery substance which adheres to the meat. 

Fruit Cream. 

One-half can of apricots, three bananas, three oranges, three cups 
of sugar, two lemons and three cups of water. Prepare the fruit as 
given in the other recipes. Pour on the water and sugar, let it stand 
awhile. Put all the pulp through a strainer, add more sugar if necessary. 
Mix with the fruit a cup of rich cream, or one pint, and freeze. This is 
delicious. If canned fruit is used, rub through a strainer and add one 
quart of whipped cream. For canned fruit use peaches, apricots, 
cherries, strawberries, etc. 

Nesselrode Pudding:. 

One-half a pint of shelled almonds, one pint of shelled chestnuts, 
a pint of canned pineapple. Boil the chestnuts half an hour and pound 
to a paste ; blanch the almonds and pound the same as the chestnuts ; 
boil the pineapple with one pint of water and one pint of sugar twenty 
minutes. Add the yolks of five eggs, well beaten, put in a dish of 
boiling water and beat until it thickens. Add the nuts and half a 
pound of French candied fruit cut up fine, to one pint of cream. Mix 
with the cooked mixture. Flavor and add a pinch of salt. Freeze 
and mold the same as ice cream. i g

Make two quarts of rich boiled custard, add two tablespoons of 
gelatine dissolved in half a cup of cold milk. Add to the custard and 
when it is just beginning to freeze add one pound of raisins, one pint 
fruit preserves, one quart of whipped cream. Almonds and grated 
cocoanut make the pudding nice but can be left out. 

Lemon Ice. 

Two quarts of water, two pounds of sugar, juice of half a dozen 
lemons grate off some of the rind, squeeze out the juice and pour the 
water hot on the lemons. Strain ; and add the sugar ; when cold freeze 
the same as cream, add the well beaten whites of three eggs and you 
have lemon sherbet. 

Orange Sherbet. 

Make the same as lemon, using ten oranges and the whites of six 
eggs. The juice and rind of two lemons greatly improve it. 

Pineapple Sherbet. 

Take one pint of fresh or one can of grated pineapple. If a fresh 
pineapple is used it will take one ; pare, dig out the eyes and reject 
the hard core, chop or grate ; add two cups of sugar, two cups of water 
and one lemon ; soak the gelatine in a little cold water and then dis- 
solve in boiling water, add the whites of two eggs and freeze. The 
egg can be omitted ; a little orange juice and pulp improves the flavor. 
Use one tablespoon of gelatine. 

Pineapple Ice. 

One can of grated pineapple, one cup and a half of sugar and one 
pint and a half of water ; pour the juice from the cans in a bowl, put 
the fruit with half the water and cook twenty minutes ; put the sugar 
in the remainder of the water and boil ; rub the cooked pineapple 
through a sieve and add the boiling syrup. Cook a few minutes longer, 
add the juice and cool and freeze.

One pint of berry juice, two cups of sugar, two cups of water, juice 
of one lemon, one tablespoonful of gelatine ; mash and put the berries 
through a sieve, add sugar and gelatine already dissolved and freeze. 
In place of the gelatine use the beaten whites of two eggs-

CREAMS AND CUSTARDS. 

(OR creams and custards, beat the yolks and the whites of the 
[K eggs separately. Use an earthen bowl. When gelatine is used, 
soak in a little cold water for awhile, and dissolve in the hot 
mixture just after it is removed from the stove. To make a good boiled 
custard the rule is, the yolks of three eggs to a pint of milk, and three 
tablespoons of sugar, or four eggs, one cup of sugar to every quart of 
milk. Always heat the milk in a double cooker, then add the sugar, 
and lastly the eggs. This keeps it from curdling. Flavor when cool. 
Use eggs that are strictly fresh, as nothing will taste so quickly in a 
cream as a packed egg. In baking custards, bake in a very slow 
oven until firm in the centre. If the oven is too hot the custard will 
turn to whey. The only spices to be used must be cinnamon and nut- 
meg. The best charlotte russe is made of well whipped cream as a 
filling. A great many people use gelatine. Cream intended for 
whipping should be first chilled on the ice, and sweetened after it 
is partly whipped. Use an egg beater. Flavor thelast thing. If the 
cream does not whip well add the white of an egg and whip with it. 
Do not whip it too long or it will turn to butter. Gelatine is put up in 
two-ounce packages. When the recipe calls for half a package one 
ounce should be used. One pint of cream will make three times 
as much whipped cream. 

Sherry Cream. 

One pint of rich cream, one cup of sherry wine, one cup of lemon 
(grated rind and juice), one cup of sugar, whites of two eggs beaten 
light. Whip the cream, add eggs and wine. Serve in glasses with 
the froth of the cream on top. 

Charlotte Russe. 

One pint of cream, one teaspoon of vanilla, one-half cup of 
sugar. Place the bowl containing the cream in cold water, whip to a 
stiff froth. Skim off the froth and strain. Whip again and repeat it. 
Line a pudding dish with slices of stale sponge cake, or dry lady fingers. 
Cover with the cream, and put pieces of currant or wine jelly on top. 
Put in a cold place until ready to serve. lj

Peach Bavarian Cream. 

A can of best peaches, mash -and rub them through a sieve. 
Put them in a saucepan and let them cook slowly a few minutes. 
Add an ounce of gelatine soaked in a half cup of water. Add a cup of 
sugar. Eemove from the fire and beat until it commences to thicken. 
Stir in a cup of cream. Serve with whipped cream. Pineapple cream 
can be made the same way by using a can of pineapple. Rub as much 
of the pineapple as you can through a seive. A pint of cream can be 
added in place of a cupful. The pineapple should be chopped fine be- 
fore it is put on to cook in the water. Pineapple makes a delicious 
cream. Use pears and apricots in the same way. 

Tapioca Cream.

a quart of milk, add half a teacup of sugar and the well beaten yolks 
of three eggs; add tapioca and stir all together; boil a few minutes, 
turn into a dish and spread on the well beaten whites of the eggs ; 
flavor the cream with vanilla. It is a good plan to cook the tapioca 
in the water it is soaked in until clear before adding it to the milk. 
This is nice poured over stale slices of sponge cake, and served with 
pieces of jelly laid around on the frosting. 

Blanc Mange. 

Take three heaping tablespoons of corn starch and dissolve in 
a little milk; beat three eggs, add three tablespoons of sugar, heat one 
quart of milk to the boiling point, stir in the starch and lastly the eggs

of sugar, flavor with lemon or vanilla or the grated rind and juice of a 
lemon, beat well and serve with whipped cream, or pour on a custard 
and serve cold. 

Fruit Blanc Mange.

DOUGHNUTS AND CRULLERS. 



tN MAKING doughnuts never mix hard. Using eggs prevents them 
from soaking the fat. Roll about half an inch thick, cut with 
cookie cutter and cut out the center with some round article about 
one-fourth as large. An iron kettle is the best for frying. Use best 
leaf lard, or half lard and the drippings from beef suet. Cottosuet is 
an excellent substitute for either. When the fat is first used clarify 
with slices of raw potato. Let them fry for a few minutes and then 
skim them out. By cooling and straining the fat can be used a second 
time. Have the fat boiling hot. If hot enough it will cease to bubble. 
Try by dropping in a small piece of your dough ; if it rises in a few sec- 
onds and browns on the under side quickly it is just right. Put in the 
doughnuts or crullers and turn as they rise to the top of the fat. Fry 
a light brown ; try with a steel fork. If the fork comes out clean, drain 
over the kettle and place in a large pan a short distance apart. Sprinkle 
powdered sugar over them and keep in a stone jar ; this keeps them 
moist. 

Good Doughnuts. 

One cup of sugar, three tablespoons of butter, melted, or take equal 
parts of butter and lard, cup and a half of buttermilk, or sour milk, 
level teaspoon of soda, pinch of salt, one-half a teaspoon of ginger and 
cinnamon, one egg. Let them stand for couple of hours and rise. 

Raised Doughnuts. 

One half cup sugar, one-half cup of butter and lard mixed (make 
this a small half cup), one egg, one cup of sweet milk, one-half cup of 
yeast, or one-half a cake of compressed yeast, one-fourth teaspoon of 
soda, one-fourth teaspoon each of salt, ginger and cinnamon. Mix over 
night and keep warm. Cut out in the morning and let them rise on the 
board for an hour. 

Doughnuts. 

One egg, cup of sweet milk, one cup of sugar, tablespoon of melted 
butter, pint and a half of flour, two teaspoons of baking powder, a little 
cinnamon and nutmeg. Mix soft and fry at once. lo

Crullers. 

One tablespoon of melted butter, two heaping tablespoons of sugar, 
one egg, one-half salt spoon of salt, one-half salt spoon of cinnamon or 
mace. Roll quarter* of an inch thick, cut in squares. Make three or 
four incisions in each square ; lift by taking alternate pieces between 
the finger and thumb ; fold together slightly in the middle and drop 
into hot fat, and fry like doughnuts. 

Crullers. 

Three tablespoons of melted butter, half a cup of sugar, three 
eggs, two tablespoons of sweet milk, half a teaspoon of soda, teaspoon- 
ful of cream of tartar, a little ginger or nutmeg.

EGGS. 



ET me say at the start, that the most to be said about eggs is, 
that the fresher they are the better they are and the more 
wholesome. Never buy eggs the freshness of which you have 
any doubt. If eggs appear heavy and dark, or if they gurgle when 
shaken, they are bad. When eggs are put in a vessel to cook, if they 
lie on their sides they are apt to be good ; but if they stand on end 
and float on top of the water, reject them at once. This is explained by 
the fact that the shells being very porous, on exposure to the air the 
water inside evaporates, eggs grow lighter, and air rushing into them 
to take the place of the water, decomposition takes place. Eggs are the 
most nutritious of food. Do not economize in the use of them. Hard 
boiled and fried eggs are the hardest to digest. Eggs with dark shells 
are the richer, as the yolks which contain the nutriment are larger. 
Eggs to be soft require three minutes ; hard, five minutes. In poach- 
ing' an egg add a little vinegar. This keeps the white of the egg 
from spreading. Eggs are prepared in an unlimited variety of styles. 
They make good dishes for breakfast and lunch and are indispensi- 
ble in cakes, puddings and desserts. Do not have the water quite 
boiling when the egg is first put in, as it is not so apt to crack as when 
the water is boiling. In poaching or frying an egg, first break them 
carefully into a saucer and slip them gently into the water or hot fat. 
In making omelets beat the yolks and whites separately. 

Boiled Eggs. 

Put the eggs in a pan, cover with hot water and let them stand 
about ten minutes where the water will keep hot, but not boil. Serve 
at once, as they soon harden in the shell, or put them on in cold water 
and when the water boils the eggs will be done. If the eggs are to be 
very soft, let them stand in the hot water only five minutes. 

Hard Boiled Eggs. 

Cook the eggs twenty minutes in water below the boiling point. If 
the yolk is cooked ten minutes it will be tough ; if cooked twenty, mealy 
and easily reduced to a powder. i q

FROSTING. 

fARE off all the loose edges and if the cake is browned too much 
pare off some of the crust. Dust with a little flour. Always 
beat eggs to a stiff froth. Separate the whites from the yolks 
and place in the ice chest so they will cool and beat readily. Add

spoons of hot water. Boil water and sugar and pour hot on the well 
beaten egg.

Make a boiled frosting of the whites of two eggs and two small 
cups of powdered sugar. Boil the sugar with four tablespoons of water. 
When all dissolved add one-quarter of a pound of scraped or grated 
chocolate Pour_on the eggs and beat until cold. This will be enough 
for the filling, of a three-layer cake and for the top. 

Yellow Frosting. 

Yolk of an egg, powdered sugar to make a stiff icing. Flavor

FRITTERS. 



IN MAKING fritters, to make them light beat yolks and whites 
separately. Do not make too thick a batter; just thick enough 
to drop from a spoon easily. Use nice sweet lard or cottosuet, 
and have it at boiling heat. Test by dropping in a little of the batter ; 
if it rises immediately and soon browns it is just right. In using 
fresh lard a good plan is to fry a few slices of potatoes in it before 
using. This clarifies it. Never use but a very little sugar in the bat- 
ter, as sugar will make them heavy; sprinkle it over them when 
ready to serve. 

Corn Fritters. 

Add two eggs well beaten, to one pint of milk ; mix well and add 
one can of fine corn. Add flour enough to make the batter the 
proper consistency and fry like griddle cakes. Serve these with 
chicken. 

Corn Fritters. 

Take one quart grated sweet corn, add two cups sweet milk, one 
cup of flour, a piece of butter two , eggs well beaten. Season with 
salt and pepper and fry like griddle cakes on a well greased griddle. 

Oyster Fritters. 

One pint of oysters, one pint of flour, a teaspoon of salt, half pint 
of water. Drain and chop oysters. Mix flour, oysters and salt to- 
gether ; add two well beaten eggs and a tablespoon of salad oil. Fry 
in boiling fat until brown. Butter can be used in place of salad oil. 

Apple Fritters. 

One cup of sweet milk, two cups of flour, heaping teaspoon of bak- 
ing powder, two eggs, tablespoon of sugar, a little salt. Throw into 
the batter thin pieces of sour apples ; about two. Fry to a light 
brown in hot lard and serve with maple syrup. These make a nice 
dessert. iv

ing sauce.

boiling water on it to make a stiff paste, stirring and beating well to 
prevent it from becoming lumpy. Let it cool and stir into it the yolks 
of three eggs and whites of two. Beat well together and drop by spoon- 
fuls in boiling lard and fry a delicate brown. Serve on a dish with a 
spoonful of preserves, marmalade or jelly.

Make a batter of a cup of sweet milk, a pint and a half of flour and 
a half cup of yeast. Set in a warm place to rise. When very light add

and a pinch of salt. Knead with the hands into a loaf. Pinch off pieces 
of the dough, and in the centre of each piece put a stoned peach. Koll 
up in the dough and put in a buttered pan some distance apart, to rise 
again. Fry in hot fat, and serve with any kind of sauce. Use apricots

FISH. 



|ISH is considered a very reliable article of food. It is not so nutri- 
tious and stimulating as meat, but very wholesome. It is espe- 
cially adapted to people upon whom there are great demands for 
nervous energy. It is so easily digested and contains so little fat and 
is richer in phosphorus than meat. Fish, to be eatable, must be per- 
fectly fresh. Good fish will have a firm, hard meat. If it looks pale 
and limp reject it as unfit to cook. Fish should be cleaned as soon as 
caught. Remove the scales with a sharp knife and cut off the head 
and tail. Wash in cold salted water thoroughly, and wipe dry, then 
place on the ice until ready to cook. Do not soak fresh fish. Always 
cook fish very well done. )Ve have the salt water, fresh water and 
shell fish. Pieces of cold fish left over make very nice salads and cro- 
quettes. Large fish are usually boiled and the small ones fried. Oily 
fish, as mackerel, salmon, blue fish, should never be fried. 

Baked Fish. 

Prepare a fish as given above ; rub the fish inside and out with 
salt and pepper. Fill with a dressing made of bread crumbs. Sew it 
up and put in a hot pan with beef drippings and a piece of butter. 
Sprinkle over it a little flour. Bake an hour. This is especially nice 
for white fish. The dressing can be left out. Lay pieces of salt pork 
on top of the fish. 

Baked Trout. 

Clean well and wipe dry. Lay on a rack in a roasting pan. Bake 
slowly, basting with butter and water. When done serve with a white 
sauce poured around it. 

- Boiled Fish. 

To make boiled fish palatable, serve always with a rich sauce. 
Put the fish in hot water with a teaspoonful of salt. Cook thirty min- 
utes. Put the fish in a piece of strong white cotton cloth if you have 
no fish kettle. This keeps it in shape. Put a tablespoon of vinegar in 
the water in which the fish is boiled. i x

Baked Fish With Oyster Stuffing. 

Remove the head, tail and skin. Rub with salt and lemon 
juice. Make a dressing as follows : One pint of oysters, one cup of sea- 
soned and buttered cracker or bread crumbs. Drain oysters and roll 
in the crumbs. Fill the fish and sprinkle the crumbs over it. Bake 
in the oven over a little water in a roasting pan forty minutes. Serve 
with tomato either poured around it or in side dishes. 

Fried Fish. 

All small fish like brook trout, smelts, etc., are best fried. Salt 
them well after they are cleaned and dried, and roll in Indian meal or 
flour. Fry half a pound of salt pork a crisp brown. Take the pork 
from the pan and put in the fish. Fry brown on one side and turn and 
fry brown on the other. Flour can be used in place of Indian meal. 

Salt Codfish. 

The fish should be washed and soaked in several waters. Put on 
in cold water, and as soon as it comes to a boil put on the back of the 
stove, and keep it hot ; but do not let it boil. Pour off the water and 
pour on a cream sauce, or serve the fish with drawn butter. 

Fish Balls. 

Prepare codfish as above. Take mashed potatoes left from dinner ; 
season well with butter, pepper and salt. A beaten egg makes them 
lighter. Mix thoroughly with the codfish. Form with the hands 
into flat cakes and fry brown in hot lard or dripoings. 

Canned Salmon. 

This is nice served with a warm cream sauce, or heat a cup of milk, 
add a large piece of butter, pepper and salt. Pour over the fish and 
let it stand in a hot oven for a few minutes. Serve hot. Salt mack- 
erel is nice served this way. 

Turbot. 

Cook a white fish tender. Remove the bones. Season with pepper 
and salt Take one pint of milk and thicken with two tablespoons of 
flour. When cool add two eggs, two tablespoons of butter and a little 
chopped onion and parsley. Put in a baking dish a layer of crumbs , 
then a layer of fish. Cover the top with crumbs and pour over all the 
sauce. Bake half an hour. A grating of cheese makes it nice. Use 
haddock in place of white fish. ly

SHELL FISH. 

Clam Stew. 

Take half a peck of clams, wash the shells. Put in a kettle with 
a cup of water. Cook until the shells open. Take out of the shells, 
strain the juice and let the clams come to a boil. Add one pint of 
milk, a large piece of butter, pepper and salt and a few small crackers 
rolled fine. To fry them take them from the shells and dry them, roll 
in beaten egg and cracker crumbs and fry in hot lard. 

Crabs. 

Remove from the shells the same as clams. Dip in beaten egg 
and cracker crumbs and fry brown. Serve with tartar sauce. 

Lobster. 

The lobster should be perfectly fresh. Never cook it too long, for 
long cooking makes it tough. Prepare the lobster as given in the mis- 
cellaneous recipes. Lobster can be broiled by covering it with soft but- 
ter, and dredge it with flour. Place on a broiler and cook a delicate 
brown. 

Stewed Lobster. 

Take the meat of a lobster and cut it into small pieces. Put two 
tablespoons of butter, two of flour, two cups of water or stock, pepper 
and salt. Add the lobster, cook ten minutes and serve. This mix- 
ture, when cold, can be cut up into chops and dipped in beaten egg and 
crumbs and fried in boiling fat. Garnish with parsley and slices of 
lemon. 

Oysters on the Half Shell. 

Do not open until ready to serve. Place six oysters on each plate 
in half the shell and a piece of lemon placed in the centre of the plate. 

Raw Oysters on Ice. 

Take a block of ice and make a hole in the top by putting on a very 
hot flatiron. Pour off" the water and repeat this until there is quite a 
cavity. Season the oysters with salt, pepper and vinegar. Put in a 
cool place. Pour the oysters in the cavity and cover with pieces of 
lemon. Cover the oysters with parsley or some bright flowers. is

Scalloped Oysters. 

One pint of oysters. Butter a dish. Put in a layer of crumbs, but- 
ter, pepper and salt and a layer of oysters and so on until the dish 
is full, finishing with a layer of crumbs. Moisten with milk or water. 
Bake until brown. Use the liquor also for wetting. A cup of cream is 
an addition. Some add lemon juice, wine or Worcestershire sauce- 
Oysters are nice escalloped in shells. Prepare the same as above 
and serve in shells. 

Fried Oysters. 

Drain carefully and pick out all the bits of shell, season with salt 
and pepper. Roll in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs and drop 
singly into hot fat. Skim out and serve with cold slaw or slices of 
lemon. Some use Indian meal in place of cracker crumbs. First roll 
in the meal, then in the egg and again in the meal. 

Creamed Oysters. 

Parboil the oysters until plump. Make a cream sauce and season 
with cayenne and celery salt. Pour over the oysters. Serve on slices 
of toast. 

Panned Oysters. 

Take large oysters — about a dozen large ones. Put on the oysters 
in their liquor ; add a tablespoon of butter, a little lemon juice, a table- 
spoon of fine cracker crumbs. Season with salt and pepper and a little 
cayenne. Cook one minute and place on slices of nice buttered toast. 

Broiled Oysters. 

Take large oysters, drain and dry them. Season with pepper and 
salt, and broil on a wire broiler or place on a rack under the blaze in 
the oven of a gas range and turn when brown. Dip in butter and then 
in powdered crumbs and broil. 

Oyster Patties. 

Take oysters and put in a pan with their liquor. Add a cup of 
milk, a little lemon rind, a large piece of butter, pepper and salt. 
Stir into the milk- a teaspoon of flour ; stir and let the mixture sim- 
mer for a few minutes. Line patty pans with puff paste. Fill 
while hot with the oysters. 2a

MEAT. 




EAT is a term given to the muscular flesh, heart, liver, brains, 
HH tongue and fat of animals. We have three classes— meat, 
poultry and game. Meat should always be cooked in such a 
way as to retain the largest proportion of juice. To boil fresh meat to 
retain the juice, put into boiling water and boil rapidly for fifteen 
minutes, then let it simmer slowly until done. Salt sets the juices 
free. When meat is boiled for stock, use cold water to extract all 
the juice and nutriment in the meat. Boil meat always slowly and 
keep covered closely. Salt meat should be put on in cold water and 
the water changed several' times according to the saltness o'f it. In 
roasting meats baste frequently, and turn ; to roast them evenly the 
new roasting pans with racks do the work with very little care. Have 
the oven very hot when the meat is first put in and after twenty 
minutes lower and keep a regular fire. The time of roasting depends 
on the size of the roast. Allow for rare meats fifteen minutes to the 
pound and twenty for roasts well done. Broiling is the most wholesome 
way of cooking steaks, chops, ham, etc. Frying in fat renders the 
meat not nearly so digestible. We use meat all seasons of the year, 
but certain kinds are better at certain seasons. Beef at all times, and 
is the staple meat. Pork is good in fall and winter, veal in the spring, 
lamb in the summer and poultry and game in the fall and winter. 
Good beef has a firm flesh and should be a bright red, the fat dry and 
crumble easily. It is much better some time after it is killed; at 
least a week old. Mutton and lamb are best kept for some time be- 
fore cooking. In veal the fat should be white and the flesh pink or 
flesh color. If it is white the blood has been taken out of the calf 
before it has been killed, and it is unfit to eat. Veal to be palatable 
should be highly seasoned and cooked very well done. Pork is the 
hardest meat to digest and should never be eaten by children or people 
with weak stomachs. It is very important to cook pork thoroughly 
and very well done. The meat of poultry is excellent for invalids, as 
it abounds in phosphorus. All game has a strong odor. It should 
be kept until tender, but no longer. All poultry and game should be

cleaned and drawn as soon as they are killed. In choosing chickens 
and turkeys choose those which have short, plump legs and y3llow 
feet, and the breasts firm and plump. Feel of the cartilage at the end 
of the breast bone ; if it is soft the fowl is young and tender, if hard 
and not pliable it is old and tough. 

Roast Beef. 

Wipe the meat with a clean towel, dredge the sides and top with 
flour, pepper and salt. Place on a rack in a roasting pan and put in a 
very hot oven ; have the pan hot. Cover closely and allow for rare 
beef fifteen minutes to a pound. If the meat is roasted in a com- 
mon dripping pan put in a little water and baste occasionally. Un- 
cover your pan a few minutes before the meat is done to brown nicely. 
Flour and salt together forms a paste which retains the juices of the 
meat. Yorkshire pudding is nice baked and served with roast beef. 
(Look in the recipes for Yorkshire pudding.) 

Broiled Beefsteak. 

Lay a thick, tender beefsteak on a gridiron with a little beef suet 
over a bed of hot coals or place the rack under the blaze of a gas range. 
When done on one side, turn quickly and cook the other. Put on a hot 
platter, season with pepper, salt and bits of butter. 

Beefsteak and Onions. 

Slice the onions thin. Put the steak in a hot pan, cover with 
the onions and season with salt and pepper. Cover tightly. When 
the meat has been browned on one side remove the onions, turn the 
steak, replace them and cook until done. 

Beef Loaf. 

Three pounds of beef chopped fine, one-half a pound of salt 
pork chopped fine ; mix with three well beaten eggs, six crackers rolled 
fine, one tablespoon of salt, teaspoon of pepper and sage and thyme 
to taste. Put bits of butter and a little water in a pan and bake 
an hour and a quarter. Baste occasionally. Slice when served. Veal 
can be used in the place of beef. 

Beef Tongue. 

Wash a fresh tongue ; cook in boiling salted water with a small 
pod of red pepper in it ; boil until it can be easily pierced with a fork ; 
remove the skin and set in a cool place. Serve sliced cold for lunch, 
or serve in a jelly. 2d

Pot Roast. 

Take a good piece from the rump or round, with some fat in it. 
Put in a kettle with as little water as will cover it. Cover closely, and 
as the water boils away add more. When the meat is tender the water 
will be all boiled away. The fat will brown it. If there is not enough 
add some drippings or a piece of butter. Brown over a slow fire. 
Make a gravy of the browned drippings. 

Beef alaMode. 

Take six pounds of good round beef. Trim off rough edges. 
Cut half a pound of salt pork into strips half an inch thick. Soak the 
beef in one cup of boiling vinegar in which has been thrown one onion 
chopped fine, two teaspoons of salt, half a teaspoonful of mustard, 
pepper, cloves and allspice. Let the meat stand in this. Pierce the 
beef with a sharp knife with holes an inch apart. Place in these 
holes the strips of pork. Put a cloth around the meat and pin it 
securely. Dredge with flour. Put chopped onion, carrot and half a 
turnip in hot fat, and fry until brown. Brown the meat in the fat and 
the vegetables. Put in some water and simmer four hours. Garnish 
with potato balls and small onions. 

Hamberg Steak. 

Take a round steak and pound it well. Fry two or three onions 
brown, in butter ; spread the onions on the steak and fold it ; season 
with salt, pepper and butter, and fry brown. A round steak can be 
chopped fine and mixed with the fried onions, and seasoned well. 
Mold into flat cakes and fry well done ." 

Corned Beef. 

Soak in cold water for an hour if very salt. Put in cold water, and 
if still salt change the water. Simmer slowly for several hours. This 
is nice with a boiled dinner. 

Fried Liver. 

Soak ten minutes in boiling water to draw out the blood; drain and 
remove the thin skin ; cut into pieces ; cut nice slices of bacon, fry crisp, 
but not brown ; take out and fry the liver in the bacon fat. This can be 
served with the slices of bacon and a brown gravy seasoned with onion 
and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. 2e

Mr. Max Gessler : 

Dear Sir — I have used your " Magic Headache Wafers" in my

prescribed them in a great number of cases and have yet to hear from 
the first case that your ''Wafers" failed to cure. I do not hesitate to

public" as a "sure cure." Yours very truly,

Tripe. 

Drain, dredge with flour and broil on a gridiron ; season with»salt, 
pepper and butter, or dip in a batter made of egg and cracker crumbs, 
and fry in hot lard. 

Lamb Chops. 

Trim and broil over hot fire ; season with salt and pepper, and serve 
with green peas . Wrap the end of the bone of each cutlet in fringed 
tissue paper and lay them overlapping one another on the platter. 

Roast Lamb. 

Prepare and roast the same as roast beef. Lamb is better roasted 
longer than beef. Serve with mint sauce. 

Roast Veal. 

Remove the bone and fill the cavity with highly seasoned and 
moist dressing; dredge with salt, pepper and flour; put strips of salt 
pork or bacon on top, and bake half an hour for each pound. Serve 
with horse-radish sauce. 

Breaded Veal. 

Take slices of veal from the leg ; remove all bone and skin ; season 
with salt and pepper ; roll in beaten egg, then in fine cracker or bread 
crumbs. Fry out several pieces of salt pork and fry the cutlets brown 
in the fat. Garnish with slices of lemon and parsley. Make a gravy 
with the fat left in the pan and two tablespoons of flour and a cup of 
water. 

Sweet-Breads. 

Those found in veal are the best. They are two glands lying 
along the back and in the breast. Put them in cold water ; remove the 
membranes; cook in salted water with a tablespoon of lemon juice; 
put in cold water ; roll in fine bread crumbs and beaten egg, and fry 
in hot fat. Fry with a slice of bacon fastened to each side. They can 
be served with cream sauce. Sweet-breads are also prepared by dip- 
ping them in a batter made of one cup of milk, one egg, one cup of 
flour, a pinch of salt and a little baking powder ; fry in salt pork fat. 

Roast Pork. 

The loin or spareribs are the best for roasting. Rub with pepper, 
salt and flour and bake thfrty minutes for each pound. Rub with a 
little sage and thyme. Bake well done. 2f

Ham. 

Ham is best broiled over a quick fire on a gridiron. Serve with 
dropped or poached eggs . If the ham is very salt freshen it with a 
little cold water and bring it to the boiling point. 

Boiled Ham. 

Pour boiling water over it and let it stand until cold. Put in a 
large kettle and boil five hours. Pull off the skin. Put in an oven 
awhile. This brings out a great quantity of fat. Serve the nicest part 
in slices cold. Save the bits for sandwiches and omelets. 



POULTRY AND GAME. 

Baked Chicken. 

Clean thoroughly. Use for a filling a pint of dry, fine bread crumbs. 
Either grate, or pound the stale bread in a bag ; add half a cup of milk, 
half a cup of butter and the yolk of an egg. Season with a teaspoon of 
salt, half a teaspoonful of powdered sage and summer savory, a tea- 
spoon ef chopped parsley and pepper. Fill the chicken and sew up. 
Baste in the oven every ten or fifteen minutes with a little water and 
butter, or dredge with salt and rub a little butter over the chicken and 
dredge with flour. This keeps in the juices. 

Fried Chicken. 

Cut up a chicken by cutting through the loose skin between the 
legs and body ; bend the legs over and cut at the joint. Then cut off 
the wings. Make an incision in the skin near the vent and cut the mem- 
brane lying between the breastbone and the tail down the backbone 
on each side. Now you can easily remove the gizzard, liver, heart and 
intestines. Remove the crop carefully. Fry the back, thighs, legs and 
wings in hot fat or drippings from salt pork or bacon. After these 
have fried awhile put in the breast. Season with chopped onion, 
herbs, and salt and pepper. Turn when browned and done on one 
side and brown on the other. This is only nice for very young, tender 
fowls. When the chicken is older and larger steam, or cook tender, 
and then fry as directed. Serve with the heart and liver fried 
brown. Garnish with fried oysters or rice croquettes. 2g

Chicken Fricassee. 

Out the chicken up as directed. Put in boiling water and add a 
little salt and pepper. Cook an hour and a half or less time accord- 
ing to the age of the chicken. Remove the bones. Dredge the meat 
with flour, salt and pepper and brown in hot butter or fry out a few 
slices of salt pork and use the fat to brown the chicken. Strain the 
liquor, add the fat left in the pan, one cup of cream or milk, a large 
tablespoon of butter and two of flour and the last thing a well beaten 
egg. Put a sliced onion in the water in which the chicken was boiled. 

Chicken Stew. 

Prepare the chicken as above, and instead of frying, add a table- 
spoon of butter, a tablespoon of flour and season with pepper and salt. 
Dumplings can be added if desired. Serve with the gravy poured 
around the chicken and surround with the dumplings. A few toma- 
toes cut up and a sliced onion with parsley, cayenne and black pepper 
makes a palatable stew. 

Chicken Pie. 

Prepare the chicken as for a stew and season the same. Put in a 
deep dish with a bottom and top crust and bake. Make a rich baking 
powder or sour milk crust and cut incisions in the top to let out the 
steam. A few sliced potatoes, a sliced onion, a little chopped parsley 
and celery improves the pie greatly. Some use only the top crust and 
it is a better plan to do so. 

Roast Turkey. 

Prepare the turkey by singeing the hairs. Remove the pin feathers 
with a knife. Cut the head off, remove the wind pipe and crop. Re- 
move the internal organs and wash inside and out thoroughly. Fill 
with a dressing and sew up. Put the turkey on the rack in the pan, 
rub well with soft butter and dredge with flour, pepper aud salt. Baste 
often and when half the time is up, turn. Allow three hours for an eight- 
pound turkey. Serve with cranberry sauce. Use oystee dressing in 
place of the dressing given. Dressing: Take one pint of fine bread 
crumbs. Season highly with powdered herbs, pepper and salt. Moisten 
with half a cup of butter and milk to make it quite moist. Add one 
well beaten egg. (See "Miscellaneous" for oyster dressing.) ah

Chicken Curry. 

Cut up the chicken and remove the bones. Season with salt and 
pepper, and brown in hot butter. Fry a large onion cut in slices in 
the butter left, add a tablespoon of flour, teaspoon of sugar and a tea- 
spoonful of curry powder. Brown in the butter ; add one cup of water 
or stock, a cup of strained tomatoes, and salt and pepper to taste. 
Pour this on the chicken and cook an hour longer. Serve with a bor- 
der of boiled rice. Use veal and lamb in the same way. 

Scalloped Turkey. 

Take bits of turkey left from dinner, butter a pan, sprinkle in a 
layer of crumbs, then a layer of chopped cold turkey. Season with 
salt and pepper ; add another layer of crumbs and so on until the pan 
is full. Moisten well with milk. Add bits of dressing and gravy left 
over. This is better than all milk. Bake brown. Cold turkey minced 
makes very nice croquettes and omelets. 

Roast Ducks. 

Pick, singe and dress the same as a turkey. Tie the wings and 
legs securely and stuff with a pint of bread crumbs, three ounces of 
butter, (bits of salt pork are nice) two chopped onions, teaspoon of 
mixed powdered herbs, and salt and pepper to taste. Do not stuff 
very full and stitch the opening firmly together to keep the fat out. 
Place in a roasting pan and baste occasionally with salt and water. 
Turn often and bake for a full hour ; if very young thirty minutes. 
Some always parboil a duck or goose before roasting. It is a good 
plan, for it disposes of some of the surplus fat. A dressing of equal 
parts of mashed potatoes and onions, seasoned well, can be used if pre- 
ferred. 

Rabbits. 

Skin and prepare as in fricasseed chicken or chicken stew. Serve 
with a white sauce the same as with chicken. To make a pie of them 
follow the directions for chicken pie. 2i

Meat Pie. 

Take cold meat, beef, turkey, veal or lamb, left from dinner; re- 
move all gristle and fat, and cut in thin slices ; put in a pudding dish 
and cover with the gravy left or with tomato ; spread mashed potatoes 
that are left from dinner over the meat. Cover with beaten egg and 
cracker crumbs, and bake twenty minutes. 

Meat Pie. - 

Take nice slices of any kind of meat left from dinner. Cook it up 
in the gravy or water, thickened a little. Add a little chopped onion 
and potato, a sprig of parsley chopped well, a little sage and pepper, 
and salt to taste. Cover with a nice baking powder crust. Make large 
incisions in the top and bake in a hot oven thirty minutes. Look in 
pastry for a recipe for the crust for a meat pie. 

Scalloped Mutton. 

Take cold roast mutton and cut in thin slices ; season with salt and 
pepper; butter a dish; put in a layer of bread or cracker crumbs, a 
layer of meat, a layer of oysters, then tomato, and lastly a layer of 
meat and crumbs. Season each layer with pieces of butter and pepper 
and salt ; moisten with gravy left over or stock of some kind. Maca- 
roni can be used in place of oysters. 

Turkish Rice. 

One cup of stewed and strained tomatoes ; to this add a cup ol 
stock seasoned with salt, pepper and a little minced onion. While 
boiling add a cup of rice ; stir lightly and add the last thing a large 
piece of butter ; steam twenty minutes in a double cooker ; serve as an 
entree or a garnish for fried chicken. 

Dutch Cheese. 

Place the milk in a pan on the back of the stove and scald it until 
the curd separates from the whey ; strain in a cloth and wring quite 
dry. Put in a bowl, and with a large piece of butter, salt and a cup of 
cream ; mix to a smooth paste. Roll into small balls, and put in a 
cool place ; season with sage if you like the flavor. There should be at 
least ten quarts of lobbered milk. 2m

Dumplings. 

One pint of flour, half a teaspoon of soda and a teaspoon cream of 
tartar or heaping teaspoon of baking powder, one teaspoon of sugar, 
half a teaspoon of salt, one teacup of milk, one egg. Drop by spoon- 
fuls into the soup or turn out on the board and cut into small 
cakes. Do not let the soup cease boiling while the dumplings are in 
it ; they require about fifteen minutes. Do not let the steam escape 
but keep covered closely. Another recipe for dumplings is, two eggs, 
a cup of sweet milk and enough flour to make a stiff batter. 

Balls for Soup. 

Egg balls are made by mxing enough corn starch with two raw 
eggs to make into round balls. Drop in the soup and cook ten 
minutes. 

Force meat balls. — To a pound of chopped beef or veal add one 
egg, a lump of butter, a cup of bread or cracker crumbs ; season with 
salt and pepper and moisten with some of the stock in which the 
meat was cooked. Make into balls and fry brown in hot lard. 

Lobsters. 

When lobsters are purchased alive tie the claws together and 
plunge into boiling water — about a gallon— in which is a tablespoon of 
salt and a teacup of vinegar. Boil for thirty minutes. It will be a 
bright red. Drain, break off the claws and tail, remove and throw 
away the soft fins which lie under the legs. Shake out the coral and 
tomalley. Draw the body from the shell, split the lobster through the 
center and with a fork pick the meat from the joints. Cut under side of 
the tail shell, open and take out meat whole. Kemember that the 
stomach is found near the head and is a small sack in which is poison- 
ous matter and should be removed, also the dark vein found in the 
tail. The lobster can be seasoned and prepared in different ways. 

Oyster Dressing. 

Take one pint of finely grated or sifted bread crumbs, add three 
tablespoons of chopped suet or butter, a spoonful of mixed herbs, half 
a teaspoon each of salt, pepper and nutmeg ; add one pint of oysters 
cut in two pieces or finer, and lastly two well beaten eggs. If not 
moist enough add sweet milk. Mix smoothly and stuff turkey or 
chicken with it. 2n

COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. 103 



'SE best butter or lard. Cottosuet is excellent for pie crust 
and very digestable. Always have your shortening fresh and 
solid. With the exception of mince pies, pastry should be 
eaten the day it is made. Make enough paste to use at once ; if any is 
left over keep it in the ice chest. Always mix the under crust a little 
stiffer than the upper with flour, this prevents the juice from soaking 
into the crust. Some use a beaten egg and rub it over the crust before 
putting in the filling. Always wet the edges of the lower crust wit i 
water or beaten egg, this causes the upper crust to adhere to the lower 
and prevents the juice from running out. Have the oven hot when the 
pie is first put in; this bakes the lower crust and prevents the crust 
from being soggy and raw. Remove from the tins as the crust is apt to 
become damp and taste of the tin. Always make opening in the upper 
crust, this lets out the steam, and especially so in meat pies of any 
kind. In making meringues for pies add one tablespoon of sugar to 
the white of one egg. Full the upper crust on a little as it shrinks in 
baking. Pies should be baked from half to three-quarters of an hour ; 
mince pies, and pumpkin or squash require a good hour and a slow fire. 

Good Pie Crust. 

Take two heaping spoonfuls of lard or butter to one cup of flour, 
and a pinch of salt. Cut well into the flour with a knife, and wet whh 
water to make a stiff dough . Mix as little as possible. This is enough 
for the upper and under crust of one pie. Use cottosuet in place of 
lard. 

Pie Crust. 2. 

To one pint of sifted flour add one even teaspoon of baking powder, 
a little salt, and sweet cream enough to make a stiff paste. This is 
enough for two pies. 

Pie Crust. 3. 

One-half cup flour before sifting, one-half cup of butter or cotto- 
suet, three tablespoons of water and a pinch of salt. In mixing the 
shortening and flour use a knife. Dredge with flour and roll your 
under crust stiffer with flour than the upper. 2o

Puff Paste. 

One quart of flour, three-quarters of a pound of butter or lard, 
yolks of two eggs, teaspoon of salt, tablespoon of powdered sugar. 
Mix with ice water in a cool place. Place flour on the board, sprinkle 
over the salt and sugar, and egg gradually, beaten up with a little ice 
water. Mix until it becomes a smooth dough. 

Apple Pie. 

Line a pan with crust ; pare and slice three or four good sized 
apples and spread evenly on the crust. Sprinkle with a small 
cup of sugar, bits of butter and sift a little cinnamon over it all ; dredge 
a little flour over the pie and about three tablespoons of water. If the 
apples are not very sour squeeze the juice from part of a lemon in the 
pie. Add upper crust and press edges firmly together. Bake in a hot 
oven. 

Dried Apple Pie. 

Put your apples — enough for a pie — in warm water, and soak over 
night. In the morning stew a few minutes ; add a little sliced lemon, 
and sugar to taste. Put in the pie and sprinkle a little flour over the 
apple, and bits of butter. 

Crab Apple Pie. 

Slice the crabs very thin, and make the same as the first recipe for 
apple pie. Add a little more sugar, as they are apt to be more tart 
than apples. These make a very rich pie, unequaled in flavor to any 
other kind of apple pie. 

Apple Shortcake. 

Line a tin with any kind of crust. With a soft cloth cover with 
melted butter ; put on the top crust and bake. Slice and 'cook your 
apples, sweeten and flavor with a little cinnamon or nutmeg. Separate 
the upper crust from the under crust, and fill with the apple. Replace 
the crust, and serve with sweetened cream. In place of apple fill with 
fresh berries or sliced peaches. 

Cream Pie. 

To one pint of milk add a pinch of salt, and a teaspoon of butter. 
Let the milk come to a boil ; add the yolks of three eggs well beaten 
with a small teacup of sugar and two even tablespoons of cornstarch. 
Bake your under crust ; fill with the custard and spread over the whites 
well beaten aud sweetened with two tablespoons of sugar. Brown in 
a quick oven. 2p 



106 COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. 

Cream Fie. 2. 

Pour a pint of cream upon upon a large cup of sugar ; let it stand 
awhile. Beat the whites of three eggs ; add this to the cream, and beat 
well. This will make two pies without upper crusts. 

Custard Pie. 

For one pie use three eggs to a pint of rich milk, a pinch of salt 
and a small teaspoon of butter, one-half cup of sugar. Let it bake 
until it custards, but does not water. 

Cocoanut Pie. 

One pint of milk, one cup of cocoanut, three eggs, one cup sugar. 
Use the whites for a meringue for the top. Bake with an under crust 
only. Instead of the dessicated cocoanut one cocoanut can be grated 
and used. 

Lemon Pie. • 

One lemon ; grate the rind, and squeeze out all the juice ; put all 
in a bowl and pour over it one cup of boiling water. When cool strain, 
and add the yolks of two eggs, a small piece of butter, one cup of sugar, 
two teaspoons of corn starch. Bake your under crust, fill with the 
custard ; spread on the whites beaten to a stiff froth and sweetened 
with two tablespoons of sugar. Eeturn to oven and brown. 

Lemon Pie. 2. 

One lemon grated rind and juice, yolks of three eggs, teaspoon of 
of butter, three tablespoons of milk, one teaspoon of cornstarch, one 
cup of sugar. Prepare as the recipe above says, leaving out the boiling 
water. 

Pie Plant Pie. 

Cut up pie plant in small pieces enough for one pie ; add one well 
beaten egg, a large cup of sugar. Mix well. Putin the crust and bake 
slowly about three-quarters of an hour. 

Squash Pie. 

A good cup of stewed and sifted squash, two eggs, one-half cup of 
sugar, butter size of an egg, one pint of sweet milk, one-half teaspoon 
each of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Beat all together, and add 
milk ; warm and bake in a deep tin with a rich under crust. 

Rice Pie. 

One-half cup of boiled rice, one cup of milk, one-half of sugar, two 
eggs, large piece of butter. Flavor with a little cinnamon, and put in 
a handful of raisins seeded. Bake with under crast only. 2q 



COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. 107 

Pumpkin Pie. 

Cut a pumpkin into thin slices, and boil until tender in as little 
water as possible. Stir often to prevent its scorching. Mash the 
pumpkin and let it stand on the back of the stove until all the water 
has dried away. Rub through a sieve. Add sugar enough to sweeten it 
well, a lump of butter, a teaspoon each of cinnamon, ginger and cloves, 
one nutmeg. Let it cook slowly. This will be enough for several pies 
and can be kept in the ice chest. For one pie take a large cup of 
the pumpkin, a pint of milk and one egg. (A little cream is nice.) 
Sweeten to taste. Bake with an under crust a good hour in a slow 
oven. ^ 

Pork Pie. 

Line a pan with crust, pare and slice good, sour apples, put^a layer 
in the bottom, seasoning with sugar and allspice. Shave very thin 
slices of salt pork, and put a layer on top of the apples, and pep- 
per. Repeat this until the pan is full. Cover with a crust, and bake 
two and one-half hours. 

Mince Meat. 

Boil six or eight pounds of good beef tender. Take off scum as it 
rises, and salt just before it is done. Put away to cool. Remove all 
bones and bits of gristle, chop very fine. Make the mince meat in the 
proportion of two bowls of chopped apples to one of meat, and one cup 
of suet chopped fine. To this add the grated rind and juice of a lemon, 
a cup of molasses, cup of brown sugar, one quart of cider, one-half pint 
of boiled cider, one pound of raisins chopped and seeded, one-half 
pound of currants, one large teaspoon each of cinnamon, cloves and 
nutmeg, one-fourth pound of citron, teaspoon of salt, a little black 
pepper. A pint of cranberries cooked and put through a sieve gives a 
nice flavor. Cook this preparation until all the apples are cooked. It 
requires a good hour or longer. If not juicy enough add syrup from 
sweet pickles, or canned currants. This quantity, doubled and put 
away in a jar in a cold place, will keep all winter. For baking take 
out enough for a pie ; if nof moist enough add the juice of some kind of 
canned fruit. If none is to be had, a little hot water. If not sweet 
enough sprinkle on a little more sugar, bits of butter, a few whole 
raisins, and lastly two tablespoons of brandy. The brandy adds 
greatly to the flavor of the pies. In making this mince meat one must 
be guided by their own judgment as to sweetness and seasoning. 
Mince pies must be baked in a slow oven some length of time, at least 
an hour. Do not make too rich a crust for them, as they are rich in 
themselves. 2r

Washington Pie. 

Cup of sugar, one egg, small half cup butter, one-half cup sweet 
milk, two teaspoons baking powder, two cups of flour. Bake in two 
layers, and fill with jelly or jam. Sprinkle powdered sugar on top, 
and serve when partly cold as a dessert. 

Cranberry Pie. 

Bake two crusts, using any recipe for nice rich cruet. Put bits of 
butter between so as to separate easily. Cook cranberries, enough 
for a pie ; sweeten to taste just before removing from the fire. Place 
the jelly between the crusts when slightly cooled. Sprinkle powdered 
sugar on top. 

Peach Cobbler. 

Take one quart of flour, add one-half cup of butter or lard, salt, 
two teaspoons of baking powder. Mix with either milk or water. Mix 
soft, and line a dish with an under crust. Put melted butter between, 
and lay on an upper crust. Bake, and when done, split open and fill 
with peaches, sliced and sweetened, or any kind of fresh fruit. Serve 
with cream. Whipped cream is delicious placed on the top. 

Chopped Cranberry Pie. 

One quart of cranberries chopped, add two cups oi sugar and half 
a cup of molasses. Dissolve one tablespoon of corn starch in a little 
cold water, and add one and one-half cups of boiling water. Stir all 
together, and bake with two crusts. This will make three pies. 
Divide the recipe for one large pie. ^ 

Sweet Potato Pie. 

When the potatoes are dry and mealy, take a quart after they have 
been pared, boiled and mashed; add a quart of milk, four eggs, a little 
sal't, cinnamon and sugar to taste. Bake with one crust. Half of this 
will make one good pie. 

Short Cake. 

One quart of flour, two heaping teaspoons of baking powder, half 
a cup of butter, two tablespoons of sugar, a little salt, enough sweet 
milk to make a soft dough. Roll soft ; do not mix. Roll in two layers 
and place pieces of butter between so they will separate easily. Bake 
in a quick oven. Spread fruit between the layers and on top. Sprinkle 
with sugar, and serve with whipped cream. This will make four 
layers if desired. Strawberries, raspberries or peaches can be used 
for fruit. 2s 



110 COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. 

Berry Pie. 

Always allow two heaping spoonfuls of sugar, one teaspoon of corn 
starch or one tablespoon of flour to one pie. Put your berries in the 
tin lined with an under crust, and sprinkle sugar and flour over them. 
Use your judgment as to quantity of sugar according to their tartness 
or juiciness. Gooseberries and cranberries or green grapes require a 
large quantity of sugar. Press the two crusts together firmly to pre- 
vent the juice from running out. Some take a strip of clean white 
cloth wet and fold around the edge. When the pie is taken out strip 
off the cloth, and the edge is nice and brown, .not burnt. In using 
canned fruit use very little sugar, and a little more flour. 

Gooseberry Pie. 

Take gooseberries, either green or ripe, and stew a little until they 
break. Sweeten well; dredge with a very little flour, and bits of 
of butter. Pour in a pie tin lined with paste, and cover with an upper 
crust. Green currants can be used this way also. 

Crust for Meat Pies. 

One quart flour, one pint of sour milk, a large teaspoon of soda 
sifted in the flour, and two tablespoons of butter or lard. Mix soft. 
Or the above recipe can be used. 

Tarts. 

Make a nice puff paste, roll out thin ; cut with biscuit cutter. Cut 
out the center of some of them and lay on the large ones. Fill with 
jelly or jam. 2t

FICKLE S are considered indispensible on a table. Pickles are 
made from almost everything in the shape of vegetables and 
fruit. Any kind of fruit that can be preserved is nice for sweet 
pickles, including the rind of water melons, and ripe cucumbers. 
Home-made pickles are tbe best ; for usually the best vinegar is em- 
ployed in making them, and good cider vinegar is very necessary to 
the best pickles. Never use any thing but a porcelain kettle in mak- 
ing them. Keep in a dry cool place. If a white mold appears on the 
top of the vinegar scald the vinegar over, and put in pieces of horse- 
radish or mustard seed. Seal sweet pickles while hot. In cooking 
sweet pickles cook until they can be easily pierced with a silver fork. 
In making a syrup for sweet pickles use three pints of best brown 
sugar to a quart of cider vinegar. If ground spices are used tie them 
up in a little bag, and throw into the hot syrup. Watch them closely 
and as soon as a white scum appears scald again, and if necessary add 
more vinegar, sugar and spices. Whole cloves and stick cinnamon are 
the only spices necessary. 

Pickled Beans. 

Take young butter beans and cook until tender. Put in brine 
made of one cup of coarse salt and two quarts of water. Let them 
stand a day or so. Take out and drain. Take two quarts of good 
cider vinegar, add a spoonful each of pepper, ginger, cloves and mace. 
Boil the vinegar and pour on the beans while hot. Pour off and boil 
the vinegar for two days in succession aud put back on the beans. 

Pickled Beets. 

Boil fine, red beets until they are tender. Put in cold water, and 
slip off the skin, and cut in slices or any shape. Cover with a vinegar 
m ade the same as for beans. A cup of sugar can be added. 2u

To Appreciate Good Cooking 

One must be in a good state of health. Is it necessary to go 
to a doctor for every little ache and pain? If you do he will 
laugh at you and charge you a good, round fee. How can 
this be avoided? By keeping in your house a line of good 
family remedies, that have stood the test of many years, being 
used by millions for all ordinary complaints. There are many 
lines of family medicines, but the one that stands head and 
shoulders above all others in this country is " Dr. Ward's," 
manufactured by The J. R. Watkins Medical Company, 
Winona, Minn. Read what the people have to say about 

Dr. Ward's Vegetable Anodine Liniment 



Wadena, Minn., Oct. 31, 1893. 
I have used Dr. Ward's Liniment for four years, and 
have found it a great benefit to my family. It beats 
anything I have ever obtained for vomiting in children. 
It is also very good for colic and pains. In fact, it is the 
best general purpose medicine I have ever had in my 
house. It has saved me some doctor bills. I would not 
be without it as long as I can get it. 

Yours respectfully, 

A. P. Johnson 






Henifer, Utah, Dec. 2, 1893. 
Having used your liniment for about two years, for 
a number of diseases, such as bad colds, cuts and 
bruises; also for pains in the bowels, coughs, colic, 
cramps and many other diseases common to humanity, 
I can highly recommend it to any person who wants to 
use a first-class remedy. Thanking you for the great, 
good you are doing humanity, I remain,

I write you in regard to your Petro-Carbo Salve. 1 
think it is THE BEST SALVE ON RECORD for cuts, 
old sores, bruises, galls and anything that a salve is 
wanted for. It just fills the bill. I would not be with-

that they are guaranteed to be. You can use this if

Cucumber Pickles. 

Take one peck of small cucumbers. Select all about the same 
size. Put in a stone jar and sprinkle on the top a large cup of salt, and 
enough boiling water to cover them. Let them stand a day or so. 
Drain off the water and put the cucumbers on the stove in cold vine- 
gar. Let them come to a boil. Add to the vinegar a cup of brown 
sugar, a few slices of green and red peppers, apiece of horse-radish, a 
few sticks of cinnamon, a few whole cloves, and some whole mustard 
seed. These pickles can be either kept in a stone jar or sealed up 
while hot in bottles. 

Chow Chow. 

Take half a peck of small cucumbers and let them stand in brine 
for several days. Put on two quarts of vinegar in which has been 
thrown a tablespoon each of mustard seed, celery seed, three green 
peppers, a few small onions and a little piece of alum. Boil the pickles 
twenty minutes in it. Add to the vinegar two pounds of sugar. Scald 
the vinegar over for three mornings. Take four ounces of mustard, 
and mix with the vinegar ; add the pickles and put them away in a cool 
place. 

Small, green tomatoes, beans, small white onions, mixed with 
small cucumbers can be made into pickles the same way. An ounce of 
tumeric adds to pickles. 

Tomato Pickles. 

Take one peck of green tomatoes and six large onions. Slice them 
and put on them a cup of salt, and let them stand over night. Drain 
well, and cook them in a gallon of cider vinegar, two pounds of brown 
sugar, half a pound of mustard seed, two green peppers chopped fine, 
a tablespoon each of allspice, cinnamon, cloves and ginger. Boil 
twenty minutes. 

Chopped Pickles. 

Take a peck of green tomatoes and chop them fine. Mix two cups 
of salt with them, and let them stand over night. Drain thoroughly ; 
cake three times as much chopped cabbage. Let the cabbage stand 
with salt on the same time as the tomatoes. Cover each with vinegar 
and let them stand awhile longer. Mix together by putting in a jar in 
layers, and on each layer put chopped green peppers, whole mustard 
seed, horse-radish, cayenne pepper. Cover with a gallon of hot cider 
vinegar in which has been put a cup of sugar. A few onions chopped 
fine can be added. 2v

Ripe Cucumber Pickles. 

Cut ripe, solid cucumbers into long pieces, about three inches 
long. Remove all seeds. Cook in water and salt until tender. Soak 
in alum water over night, using a lump of alum the size of a hickory 
nut. This hardens them, and makes them firm. Drain well and pour 
over them a syrup made of three pints of sugar to a quart of vinegar. 
Add stick cinnamon, whole cloves and mace ; about two tablespoons 
of each. Scald the syrup and replace it on the pickles three mornings 
in succession. Then seal and put in a cool place. Be careful not to 
cook too soft. Use about a tablespoonful of salt to two quarts of water. 

Water Melon Pickles. 

Pare off the green rind, and cut in oblong pieces. Make and pre- 
pare the syrup the same as the above recipe says. Take off all of the 
red part of the melon. Pickle only the white rind. If a scum rises 
skim the syrup. 

Peach Pickles. 

Pare freestone peaches. Put in a jar and pour over them a syrup 
made of three pints of sugar to a quart of vinegar. Skim the syrup 
well, and pour on the fruit boiling hot. Repeat this for several days. 
Put pieces of cinnamon and cloves between the layers of peaches and 
stick some of the whole cloves in the fruit. Lastly scald the fruit, 
vinegar and spices together. Have the fruit the same color through- 
out. If there is not syrup enough to cover them well prepare more. 

Pear Pickles. 

Cut the fruit in halves and pare if large, if small leave whole. Pre- 
pare and make the same as peach pickles . 

Spiced Currants. 

Put a tablespoon each of cloves, cinnamon, mace and allspice in a 
bag and boil with four pounds of currants, two of sugar and one pint 
of vinegar. Some add a pound of raisins. Seal while hot in glass jars. 
Spice blackberries the same way ; do not use quite so much sugar. 
Leave out the spices if one prefers. 2w

PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 



fHESE are usually prepared with equal weights of sugar and 
fruit. Most people prefer preserves not so sweet, and use three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit and even less. 
Prepare the syrup and clarify it, then put in the fruit. Fruit like 
quinces, citron, melon rinds, cherries, currants, etc., harden if first put 
into the syrup. Cook in a little water until tender, or in a weak syrup 
first, then add them to the syrup. In very soft ripe fruits pour the 
boiling syrup on them and let them stand over night. The secret of 
keeping fruit is to have the covers of the cans fit securely, and keep 
the fruit in a dark, cool place. 

In jellies extract the juice first by cooking the fruit in just enough 
water to keep it from burning, and strain the juice through a coarse 
flannel or cotton bag. Hang the bag over the kettle and let it drain. The 
rule is usually equal measures of fruit and sugar ; sweeten less if pre- 
ferred. Boil juice first, skim and add the sugar and boil until it jellies 
when a little of it is cooled. When jelly is put away cover the top 
with pieces of writing paper brushed with the white of an egg. Some 
use a little butter to grease the papers or wet them in brandy. 

Citron Preserves.\ 

Pare off the rind and cut in thin slices two inches long. Add 
equal weights of sugar and fruit and boil twenty minutes. Before 
adding the sugar boil tr^e citron in a little water, tender; add two 
sliced lemons to each pound of fruit. Kemove the fruit and boil the 
syrup down some, put in the fruit and boil awhile and seal in cans or 
jars. 

Peach Preserves. 

Pare the peaches and remove most of the pits ; leave some to 
give the syrup a flavor. Make a syrup of three-quarters of a pound 
of sugar to one of fruit. Add water enough to dissolve the sugar. Skim 
and clarify. Add the fruit in small quantities at a time and cook 
eight to ten minutes. Skim out in a jar and put in more fruit. When 
all done fil the cans with the syrup and seal securely. A good plan is 
to pour off the syrup the next day and scald, and return to the can. 



116 COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. 

Pear Preserves. 

Pare, cut in halves, prepare and make exactly the same as peach 
preserves. 

Plum Preserves. 

Take plums, wash them and prick each plum and put them in a 
stone jar. Make a thick syrup of equal weights of sugar and fruit. 
Pour the syrup on the fruit, and let it>tand over night ; repeat this'for 
three days. Put fruit and syrup in a porcelain kettle and boil for an 
hour. Put in stone jars. 

Quince Preserves. 

Pare, core and quarter or slice your quinces ; boil till tender in 
a little water. Take out and drain. Add equal weight of "sugar to 
the water, replace the fruit and boil until clear. Take equal parts of 
quinces and quarters of nice sweet apples and preserve as for quinces. 
Cook the parings and cores and use the water for jelly, or add it to the 
sugar for the syrup of the quinces. 

Tomato Preserves. 

Take green tomatoes that are just beginning to turn ; if red a little 
all the better. Pare and slice. Take equal weights of sugar and fruit 
and cook all together until the syrup is thick. Add one or two lemons 
sliced for additional flavor. 

Cider Apple Sauce. 

Pare and quarter nice sweet apples, put them in boiled cider 
enough to cover them and boil until tender. Any kind of apples can 
be used. 

Apple Jelly. 

Wash and quarter large crabs ; cook in water enough to keep them 
from burning. Cook to a pulp, strain according to directions. Take 
three-quarters of a bowl of sugar to a bowl of juice. Boil the juice 
twenty minutes ; add the sugar and boil five minutes longer. Try it 
to see if it jellies. 

Preserved Berries. 

To preserve strawberries, raspberries, currants, cherries or black- 
berries, take a bowl of fruit and a bowl of sugar. Dissolve the sugar in 
a very little water and add the fruit ; cook until soft ; skim as it needs it. 
Cherries should be stoned, but use some of the pits for flavor. 2y

Brandy Peaches. 

Prepare peaches as the recipe for preserved peaches says, and 
just as the syrup is removed from the fire, add half a cup of brandy to 
a pound of fruit. 

Grape Jelly. 

Eub the fruit through a sieve ; add a cup of sugar to a cup of pulp 
or three-quarters as much sugar as pulp. Boil the juice twenty minutes, 
and add the sugar. Boil until it jellies. 

Quince Jelly. 

Use the best parts of the fruit for preserves, and cook the skins, 
cores and hard part of the quince for jelly. Boil in enough water to 
cover. Mash and drain . Add equal weight of sugar and juice. Boil 
until it jellies. 

Currant Jelly. 

Do not 'have the currants over-ripe. Take equal parts of red and 
white currants if you can get them. Pick over and remove all leaves 
and poor fruit. Mash them in a kettle and drain in a flannel bag for 
several hours. Take a bowl of sugar to a bowl of juice. Boil the juice 
twenty minutes. Skim thoroughly ; add the sugar and boil five minutes 
longer; turn into glasses and let them remain where the sun can shine 
on them several hours before sealing. Cover them with a paper 
dipped in brandy. 

Berry Jam. 

Pick over and mash the fruit ; allow a pound of sugar to a pound 
of fruit. Boil until the jam looks dry and glistening, and no moisture 
gathers. This answers for raspberries, strawberries or blackberries. 
Equal parts of red and black raspberries make delicious jam. 

Grape Jam. 

Stew the grapes in a little water and press the fruit through a 
colander, adding a little water to get all the pulp through. Add sugar 
and make like the jam above. This answers for plums and goose- 
berries. 

Wine Jelly. 

Dissolve one box of gelatine in one pint of cold water ; add four 
coffee cups of sugar and the juice and rind of two lemons ; a little stick 
cinnamon. Let the gelatine stand an hour ; add the sugar, lemon, 
three pints of boiling water and one pint of sherry. Strain into molds 
and let it stand until thick. 2z

PUDDINGS. 



rgVREPARE your butter, eggs and sugar as for cake. Do not put in 
[) too much sugar, as it is apt to make the pudding heavy. Pud- 
dings are either boiled, baked or steamed. If boiled use a bag 
made of fine drilling with a tape run in the top, or a tin mold with 
a cloth tied securely over it. Always flour your bag or cloth tied over 
the mold. Let the water entirely cover the bag ; leave space in the 
bag or mold for the pudding to swell ; turn it over frequently. Boiled 
puddings require more time than the others. Rice, bread and fruit 
puddings require a slow fire, and some time in baking. Batter and 
corn starch puddings, a quick oven. Steaming answers all purposes 
and is the most convenient and wholesome. Have your water boiling 
and steamer hot when the pudding is first put on, and do not let the 
water stop boiling. Replenish if necessary from the tea kettle in which 
the water is hot. Do not uncover and allow the steam to escape until 
the time is up. If these directions are followed a light, wholesome 
pudding is the result, if not, a soggy, heavy one? In making custards 
for puddings bring your milk to a boil, and then add your sugar and 
salt, and lastly, the well beaten eggs. If corn starch is used, either 
dissolve in a littld cold milk or stir thoroughly in the sugar ; otherwise 
the mixture will be lumpy. Stir constantly and cook always in a 
double cooker ; add your flavorings after removing from the stove. 
Beat yolks and whites separately. To keep your custard from curdling 
a good plan is to add your sugar to the boiling milk and then the 
eggs. 

Apple Pudding. 

One egg, small half cup of butter, one cup of sugar, cup of sweet 
milk, level teaspoon of soda, and two of cream of tartar, or in place

apples ; pour oh the butter, and bake in a quick oven half an hour. 
Serve with a cream or common sauce. (See sauces.) 3b

oven three-quarters of an hour. Uncover and brown quickly. Eat 
with cream or sweet sauce flavored with lemon. 

Delicious Bread Pudding. 

Two cups of finely sifted bread crumbs, one quart of milk, yolks 
of four eggs, piece of butter size of an egg. Beat yolks, add milk and 
crumbs and butter ; grated rind of one lemon. Bake half an hour. Do 
not let it remain in the oven too long or it will be watery. Spread with 
a layer of jelly and cover with a meringue made of the whites of the 
eggs flavored with the juice of half the lemon. Return to oven, and 
brown. This can be served alone or with a hard sauce. (See sauces.) 

Cottage Pudding. 

One cup of milk, two eggs, one cup of sugar, two cups of flour, 
three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two teaspoonfuls of baking

PUDDING SAUCES. 



In making sauces, if corn starch or flour is used, mix thoroughly 
with the sugar while dry. This will keep lumps from forming. Do 
not boil the sauce after the butter is added. If brandy or wine is 
used, flavor after removing from the fire. If the juice or rind of a 
lemon or orange is used put in just before removing, as boiling with 
any of the grated rind is apt to make the sauce bitter. Do not make 
your sauce until ready to serve. 3g

Bed bugs, according to a lady correspondent, have a great aversion 
to salt. She states that if the articles and places infested with bed 
bugs are washed with salt water, and the crevices in which the ver-

Lock Jaw. — The following is well worth saving for future refer- 
ence: " Locked jaw from a rusty nail in the foot was entirely cured 
in four cases reported by Dr. Kinkle, by applying to the whole spinal 
column cloths saturated with chloroform, just at the approach of the 
spasm. It was repeated at several returns of the spasm, always in- 
ducing sleep and finally recovery." 

A young man out west was intrusted with the money to bring his

SALADS. 



^fc^jALADS should come to the table fresh, crisp and cold. To crisp 
L^^ lettuce, celery or cabbage place them in the ice chest some 
U time before serving. Never press down a salad to get it into 
form. In arranging the salad toss it lightly with a fork. Do not cover 
a delicate salad with hard boiled eggs or boiled beets, etc. Keserve 
these for chicken, veal or turkey salads. Use the white leaves of the 
celery, and the light green leaves of the lettuce. Always tear lettuce, 
do not cut it. Wash it thoroughly, as hot house lettuce is very apt 
to be covered with little green lice. Always wash all vegetables 
thoroughly. Cut chicken with a knife not to fine. Shave cabbage 
with a sharp knife, and cut your celery into small pieces. This is 
better than chopping it. Rich salads like chicken, veal, salmon, 
lobster, and shrimp are not served after meats at dinner, but are only 
appropriate for lunch or tea. Vegetable salads, like lettuce, cucumber, 
potato, tomato or cabbage are the best after meats. Do not add the 
dressing until the salad is ready to be served. Salads can be garn- 
ished with pieces of jelly, celery heads and the heart of the lettuce. 
Use slices of lemon for all kind of fish salads. Asparagus, string 
beans and peas must all be boiled in salted water until tender before 
using. In mixing dressings, if hard boiled eggs are used powder them 
with the back of a spoon ; beat raw eggs very light, add oil, and lastly 
vinegar. A dressing should be ice cold before putting on the salad. 
When oil is used pour in a drop at a time beating well all the time. A 
nice way to serve fish salads is in shells in each of which is placed a 
leaf of lettuce. Chicken salad can be served in a salad dish or enough 
for one individual can be placed in a shell made of two leaves of let- 
tuce and served from a platter. Use the Mayonnaise or cooked dress- 
ing with all kinds of meat or fish salads. For green salads use a plain 
or French dressing. 8m 



134 COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. 



Salad Dressing. 1. 

Mash the yolks of two hard boiled eggs, add one teaspoon each of 
mustard and salt, a little cayenne pepper and a pinch of black pep- 
per, piece of butter size of an egg, or three tablespoons of olive oil, 
yolk of one raw egg, one-half cup of vinegar. A tablespoon of sugar 
improves it. This is excellent for any kind of a salad. 

French Salad Dressing. 

One salt spoon of salt, one-half salt spoon of pepper, three table- 
spoons of oil, one tablespoon of vinegar. If you like the flavor of 
onion, add one tablespoon of onion juice. This can be obtained by 
grating the onion with a coarse grater. To prepare this put the salt 
and pepper in a cup, add the oil slowly, and then the vinegar. This 
is nice for lettuce or potato salad. 

Simple Salad Dressing. 

Three eggs, one tablespoon each of sugar, oil and salt, small table- 
spoon of mustard, cup of milk and one of vinegar. Stir oil, sugar, salt 
and mustard until smooth, add eggs and vinegar and lastly milk. Put 
in a bowl and place in boiling water until it thickens. This is enough 
to use several times. 

Cream Salad Dressing. 

One-half cup of vinegar, a piece of butter the size of an egg, yolk 
of one egg, a teaspoon of mustard, half a teaspoon of salt, a little cay- 
enne pepper, two tablespoons of sugar. Cream sugar, butter, mus- 
tard, egg and salt together; add vinegar and put in a bowl in boiling 
water until it thickens like custard. Remove and add two table- 
spoons of thick sweet cream. This is excellent for cabbage or lettuce 
salads or any kind of a salad. 

Quick Salad Dressing. 

This can be made at the table. Yolk of an egg, tablespoon of 
mustard, pinch of salt, six tablespoons of olive oil, tablespoon of lemon 
juice. Stir yolk, mustard and salt until they thicken, and add oil drop 
by drop, stirring all the time. 

Mayonnaise Dressing with Butter. 

The yolks of two eggs, one level teaspoon of salt, one of pepper, 
two of white sugar, two teaspoons of mustard, one tablespoon of but- 
ter, four tablespoons of vinegar. Stir mixture thoroughly. Put in a 
bowl in hot water and stir until it thickens, and then set away to cool.

COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. 135 



Mayonnaise Dressing. 2. 

Beat the yolks of three eggs very light, add a tablespoon of sugar, 
tablespoon of mustard, a little cayenne pepper, teaspoon of salt. Beat 
all to a cream, put in a bowl set in ice water and add a pint of olive 
oil, dropping in gradually a few drops at a time until the mixture is 
thick and very hard. Thin with half a cup of vinegar and juice of half a 
lemon. A cup of whipped cream makes it very nice, but can be 
omitted without injury to the dressing. This can be doubled for a 
large company. 

Chicken Salad. 1. 

Free one cold boiled or roasted chicken of bones and skin. Cut the 
meat into little dice or long strips . Season with salt and pepper. There 
should be a quart. Have a pint of nice tender celery, cut into small 
pieces about half an inch thick. Mix with the meat and when ready 
to serve pour over it a Mayonnaise dressing. Garnish with slices of 
hard boiled eggs or dices of beets. Serve on a platter, putting enough 
for one individual on one of the large leaves of the lettuce. 

Chicken Salad. £. 

Cut up one chicken, using only the tender meat, add one cup of 
cabbage, shaved very fine with a sharp knife, and one cup of celery 
cut in small pieces. Pour over it a Mayonnaise dressing (see Mayon- 
naise dressing with butter). Serve in a salad dish garnished with the 
green leaves of the celery and the small leaves of the lettuce. 

Turkey Salad. 

This is especially nice in preparing for a large company. The 
meat takes the place of chicken and is just as nice. Make the same as 
chicken salad, using half cabbage and half celery. Garnish with 
slices of cold hard boiled eggs and the green leaves of the celery. 

Lettuce Salad. 

Wash each leaf carefully. Drain and keep in a cool place until 
ready to serve. Put the leaves in a salad bowl, the light ones in the 
center. Tear some of the larger ones and arrange around these. 
Pour over all a French dressing. A cream dressing can be used if de- 
sired. 3o

naise dressing over it. Garnish with hard boiled eggs, and slices of 
lemon. Fresh salmon can be used the same way. Celery can be used 
with the lettuce. Serve in shells lined with lettuce. 

Lobster Salad. 

Cut up the lobster like chicken, season with a French dressing. 
Let it stand until ready to serve. Then tear up one-third as much 
lettuce, mix with the lobster, and serve in a nest made of two large 
lettuce leaves. Mix half of the Mayonnaise dressing with the lobster. 
Put a tablespoon of the prepared lobster in the nest with a tablespoon 
of the Mayonnaise dressing. Serve in a platter. Garnish with pars-

SOUPS. 



rt0A OUPS are made from meat, fish and vegetables, with water or 
|S^ milk. They are classified according to material, color, quality, 
^U etc. When soup is made of stock, meat is the basis. To make 
nutritious, healthful soups, requires study and practice. Always have 
materials on hand such as dried herbs, rice, okra, vermicelli, onions, 
carrots, whole as well as ground spices. Parsley is another necessary 
article. With these soups can be make from scraps of meat left from 
a meal. Pieces of steak, bones of roast beef or veal make a good 
stock. Save the water in which chickens, beef tongues or leg of mutton 
are cooked. The carcass of a turkey, in which are remnants of the 
dressing, cooked slowly makes an excellent soup. It is not necessary 
to buy meat expressly for the purpose of making soup stock. 

By stock we mean a liquid containing the juice and soluble parts 
of meat and bone, which has been extracted by slow cooking. Stock 
made from meat without bone or gristle will not jelly when cold. 
Stock can be made from the cheapest inferior parts of meat, whieh yield 
the most nutriment when cooked. When buying meat for stock select 
a piece from the shin or lower part of the round of beef or veal. This 
has a bone with marrow, and a large proportion of gelatine. Stock 
made from roasted or browned meats is the most nutritious. A bay 
leaf adds greatly to the flavor of soup. Always put your meat or soup 
bone into cold water without salt, and let it cook slowly for several 
hours. Cover closely ; thus keep the flavor of the meat from escap- 
ing with the steam, and also prevents it from being reduced too 
quickly by evaporation. Skim the stock several times, and when the 
meat is reduced to rags, strain, and put away in an earthen jar. When 
cold remove the grease from the top. This is the basis of several 
kinds of soups, and will keep in a cool place for some time. Soups 
can be served thin, or thickened with flour, corn starch and different 
vegetables. Do not put away stock with vegetables in it, as they are 
apt to sour it. For coloring soups brown, use caramel, browned flour 
and onions browned in butter. Caramel can be made by boiling one 
cup of sugar and two teaspoons of water in a sauce pan until brown ; 
then add half a cup of water and boil for a few minutes. Serve soups with 

30 



COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. . 141 

bread browned in the oven, and cut in small dice, or squares of bread 
thrown into boiling fat, and browned. Serve with oyster soup crack- 
ers crisped in a hot oven. Clear stock by removing the fat, and using 
the white of an egg for every quart of stock. Do not add the egg when 
the stock is hot, but set it on the fire and stir all the time, until it 
comes to a boil. A scum will form which when taken off leaves the 
liquid clear and sparkling. Always strain thoroughly. Cook your 
vegetables that require long boiling, as rice, sago, macaroni, tapioca, 
etc., separately, then add the stock. Serve with clear soups slices of 
lemon, yolks of hard boiled eggs, force meat balls, or a spoonful of 
grated Parmesau cheese on each plate. The nicest of clear soups is 
the French, called Consomme. 

For five pounds of clear meat and bone use about six quarts of 
water. Add a pinch of sugar to all soups. Thick soups require more 
seasoning than thin ones. Never use any kind of meat that is the 
least bit tainted, as the stock witl taste of it. Cayenne pepper, Worces- 
tershire, Halford or Chili sauces and catsup are used by some, but 
must be used cautiously. Wine is also used by some for the extra 
flavor. If soup is salted too much modify by adding a little sugar and 
a tablespoon of vinegar.

VEGETABLES. 



fjjg) Y VEGETABLES we mean such plants as are used for food, and 
[gp comprise all parts of the plant from the root to the leaves- 
The fresher the vegetables are the better. They should be 
washed and cleaned thoroughly in cold water, and cooked in boiling 
water. Always salt the water in the proportion of a teaspoonful of salt 
to a quart of water. The time of cooking varies with the age of the 
vegetable. All should be cooked until tender, and no longer. String 
beans, turnips, parsnips, carrots and cauliflower require from one to 
two hours. Potatoes boiled require thirty minutes ; fcbaked forty-five. 
Onions are best put in warm salt water for awhile before cooking ; this 
removes the strong odor. In cooking greens add salt and a pinch of 
soda to preserve the color. Add a pinch of soda always to any kind of 
beans. This removes the strong, beany taste. Old potatoes should be 
soaked in cold water some time before cooking. In cooking potatoes 
remove and drain as soon as done. Uncover a little to let the steam 
out, and place on the back of the stove to dry out. This makes them 
mealy. »The secret of mealy potatoes is to cook them rapidly and re- 
move and drain as soon as done. Try with a fork, and if soft, drain. 
Some prick baked potatoes as soon as done or squeeze a little. This 
lets out the steam and keeps them from being watery. Raw potatoes 
that are to be fried should be sliced thin, and soaked in cold water. 
This draws out the starch and makes them crisp instead of mealy. 

Asparagus. 

Wash and clean thoroughly. Use only the tender part of the 
stalk. Cut off any that is white. Boil in salted water. Boil the stalk 
first, and then throw in the tips. When tender season with a little 
cream, lump of butter and pepper to taste. The asparagus can be 
cooked whole and served with melted butter. 4b 



150 COMMON SENSE COOK BOOK. 



Asparagus on Toast. 

Prepare as above, only leave the stalks whole. "When tender put 
in a lump of butter, pepper and a little thickening if one likes it, and 
pour it over slices of toasted bread. The water must be boiled down 
so as to leave just enough for the gravy. Use a teaspoon of corn 
starch for thickening. 

String Beans. 

String by cutting off the ends of the pods. Cut in inch pieces or 
break. Boil from one to two hours until perfectly tender. Beans re- 
quire longer time than most vegetables. Throw in a pinch of soda 
just before draining. Add a cup of cream or part milk, a piece of but- 
ter, salt and pepper to taste. Shelled beans should be prepared with 
the same kind of dressing, only they do not require as great a length of 
time to cook tender. 

Baked Beans. 

Pick over and wash one quart of beans, soak in plenty of water 
over night. In the morning pour off the water ; cover with hot water 
and let them come to a boil. Pour off this water and add more. Boil 
until they begin to split. Put the beans in an earthen jar or crock 
always saved for this purpose. Throw in a pinch of soda. Put in the 
bottom one pound of good fat and lean salt pork. Mix a little mustard 
with two tablespoons of molasses, and a little water. Have water to 
cover the beans. Bake all day. Watch them and if they need any 
more seasoning and water add it. Some add a little chopped onion 
for additional flavor or put two slices of an onion on top of beans. 

Boiled Dinner. 

Use a nice piece of corn beef, put on in warm water and when it 
comes to a boil pour off the water and add enough more to cover well. 
Skim off the scum as it rises. Before the vegetables are put in remove 
the meat and put in vegetables as follows : Turnips cut in slices, cook 
awhile and then add cabbage cut in quarters, pototoes whole and a 
few carrots or parsnips. Beets should be boiled in some of the liquor 
separately. After removing the vegetables put in the meat for a few 
minutes to heat through. Serve cabbage and beets in separate dishes. 
Place turnips and carrots or parsnips on the platter with the meat. 
Season with butter, pepper and vinegar to suit the individual taste. 
Prepare the beets as the recipe below says. 4c

Beets. 

Cook whole. Do not break off fibers or roots, or peel, as the juices 
escape. Cook from one to five hours. When tender drop in cold 
water and slip off the skins. Slice in a dish, add pieces of butter, pep- 
per and salt ; pour over a little vinegar and let them stand in a hot oven 
a few minutes. Serve hot. Place some of the beets in vinegar and a 
few pieces of horse radish on top and let stand for a day or so for 
pickles.

teaspoon of salt, pepper, one pint of grated corn. Pour corn on the 
flour, add the rest and fry in the frying pan in which is hot fat to the 
depth of two inches. Put in batter by spoonfuls. 

Boiled Corn. 

Clean off all the silk carefully and cut the heads off the cob. Boil 
in salt water three-quarters of an hour, or cut the corn (after it is 
cleaned) with a sharp knife from the cob. Stew with a little water. 
When tender add milk, butter, pepper and salt to taste. Beaten eggs 
added makes a rich dish. 

Cauliflower . 

Take off the green leaves and stalk, put on to cook in boiling water. 
Boil for an hour or longer until tender ; pour off water and add a cream 
sauce. It is a good plan to let it soak in salt water before cooking. 

Succotash. 

Take equal quantities of shelled beans and corn cut from the cob. 
Cook each separately until tender. Mix together and season with 
cream and milk, a large piece of butter, pepper and salt. A little 
sugar if one likes it. Succotash can be made from canned corn and dry 
beans the same way. The beans must be soaked over night and boiled 
until tender before adding them to the corn. Season as above. 

Cabbage. 

Slice with a sharp knife very fine, put in a stew pan and add a lit- 
tle water. Cover closely and cook until tender. Add milk, butter, 
pepper and salt to taste, or a cream sauce. 4d 



152 THE WEINHOLD DRUG CO. 

Fried Cabbage. 

Slice cabbage fine, place in a pan in which are some pieces of bacon 
or salt pork, previously fried a little. Add a little water, cover closely 
and cook down until brown. Some add a little vinegar just before re- 
moving from the stove. Cabbage is considered indigestable, and some 
boil it with a small piece of red pepper and change the water once or 
twice. It is more wholesome served as a salad. 

Celery with Cream Sauce. 

Wash and scrape celery, cut in pieces two inches long. Boil half 
an hour, drain off water and add a cream sauce. (See sauces.) 

Egg Plant. 

Cut the plant in slices, pare these and cover with boiling water in 
which has been put a teaspoonful of salt ; let this stand an hour. 
Drain, and pepper the slices and dip in beaten egg and bread crumbs. 
Fry the piec es in boiling fat. Or the slices can be fried in just enough 
pork fat or >acon to brown them. 

Macaroni and Cheese. 

Boil about four ounces of macaroni, broken up in small pieces in 
a little salted water about fifteen minutes. Grate a quantity of cheese. 
Put in an earthen dish a layer of macaroni, a layer of grated cheese, 
bits of butter, pepper and salt, another layer of macaroni, then cheese 
until the dish is full. Pour over it all enough milk and cream to come 
to the top. Bake slowly three-quarters of an hour. 

Macaroni with Tomato. 

Boil in a little salted water a little macaroni (about a cupful) 
a few minutes, pour over it a quart of canned tomatoes. Season with 
pieces of butter, salt, pepper, a little minced onion and sprinkle sifted 
bread crumbs on top. Bake in hot oven three-quarters of an hour. 

Italian Macaroni. 

Take a piece of beef, about two pounds, half a pound of salt pork, 
two chopped onions. Let all cook for awhile ; add a quart of toma- 
toes, pepper and salt, and cook all for three hours. Boil a sufficient 
quantity of macaroni fifteen minutes, put a layer in a dish, cover with 
some of the mixture above, a layer of grated cheese and so on until the 
dish is filled. Bake an hour. 4e

Squash. 

Squash can be either steamed or baked. If steamed remove from 
shell, and mash and season with a liberal supply of butter, a little 
pepper and salt. If baked, cut in small pieces and serve. Let each 
individual season his own to taste. 

Turnips. 

Cook these from one to two hours. Cut in thin slices. Mash fine 
and season with butter, pepper and salt. Some pour white sauce over 
them. 

Parsnips. 

These, to be fit to eat, should remain in the ground during the 
winter. Boil, cut into half -inch pieces and serve with cream sauce, 
or fry pieces in frying pan with lard or drippings. 

Tomatoes. 

Scald, peel and cut in slices. Cook as rapidly as possible. Sea- 
son with a large piece of butter, pepper and salt, and a little sugar. 
Canned tomatoes can be used the same way. Serve with toast if de- 
sired. A little minced onion flavors them nicely. 4h
