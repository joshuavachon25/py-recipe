PREFACE 



•'But for life the universe were nothing; and all 
that has life requires nourishment" 

With the progress of knowledge the needs of the 
human body have not been forgotten. During the last 
decade much time has been given by scientists to the 
study of foods and their dietetic value, and it is a 
subject which rightfully should demand much con- 
sideration from alL I certainly feel that the time is 
not far distant when a knowledge of the principles of 
diet will be an essential part of one's education. Then 
mankind will eat to live, will be able to do better 
mental and physical work, and disease will be less 
frequent. 

At the earnest solicitation of educators, pupils, and 
friends, I have been urged to prepare this book, and I 
trust it may be a help to many who need its aid. It 
is my wish that it may not only be looked upon as a 
compilation of tried and tested recipes, but that it may 
awaken an interest through its condensed scientific 
knowledge which will lead to deeper thought and 
broader study of what to eat

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL 

COOK BOOK 



CHAPTER I 

FOOD 

FOOD is anything which nourishes the body. From fifteen 
to twenty elements enter into the composition of the 
body, of which the following thirteen are considered : oxy- 
gen, 62>£% ; carbon, 21>£% ; hydrogen, 10%; nitrogen, 
Zof ; calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, so- 
dium, magnesium, iron, and fluorine the remaining 8%. 

Food is necessary for growth, repair, and energy ; there- 
fore the elements composing the body must be found in the 
food. The thirteen elements named are formed into chem- 
ical compounds by the vegetable and animal kingdoms to 
support the highest order of being, man. All food must 
undergo chemical change after being taken into the body, 
before it can be utilized by the body ; this is the office of the 
digestive system. 

Food is classified as follows : — 

(1. Proteid (nitrogenous or albuminous) 
2. Carbohydrates (sugar and starch) 
3. Fats and oils 

, T , fl. Mineral matter 

II. Inorganic { n „ r . 

(2. Water 

The chief office of proteids is to build and repair tissues. 
They furnish energy, but at greater cost than carbohydrates, 
fats, and oils. They contain nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, hy- 
drogen, and sulphur or phosphorus, and include all forms of 



2 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

animal foods (excepting fats and glycogen) and some vegeta- 
ble foods. Examples: milk, cheese, eggs, meat, fish, cere- 
als, peas, beans, and lentils. The principal constituent of 
proteid food is albumen. Albumen as found in food takes 
different names, but has the same chemical composition ; as, 
albumen in eggs, fibrin in meat, casein in milk and cheese, 
vegetable casein or legumen in peas, beans, and lentils ; and 
gluten in wheat. To this same class belongs gelatin. 

The chief office of the carbohydrates is to furnish energy 
and maintain heat. They contain carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen, and include foods containing starch and sugar. 
Examples : vegetables, fruits, cereals, sugars, and gums. 

The chief office of fats and oils is to store energy and heat 
to be used as needed, and constitute the adipose tissues of 
the body. Examples: butter, cream, fat of meat, fish, 
cereals, nuts, and the berry of the olive-tree. 

The chief office of mineral matter is to furnish the neces- 
sary salts which are found in all animal and vegetable foods. 
Examples : sodium chloride (common salt) ; carbonates, sul- 
phates and phosphates of sodium, potassium, and magne- 
sium ; besides calcium phosphates and iron. 

Water constitutes about two- thirds the weight of the body, 
and is in all tissues and fluids ; therefore its abundant use is 
necessary. One of the greatest errors in diet is neglect to 
take enough water ; while it is found in all animal and vege- 
table food, the amount is insufficient. 

CORRECT PROPORTIONS OF FOOD 

Age, sex, occupation, climate, and season must determine 
the diet of a person in normal condition. 

Liquid food (milk or milk in preparation with the various 
prepared foods on the market) should constitute the diet of 
a child for the first eighteen months. After the teeth appear, 
by which time ferments have been developed for the diges- 
tion of starchy foods, entire wheat bread, baked potatoes, 
cereals, meat broths, and occasionally boiled eggs may be 
given. If mothers would use Dr. Johnson's Educators in 
place of the various sweet crackers, children would be as

well pleased and better nourished; with a glass of milk 
they form a supper suited to the needs of little ones, and ex- 
perience has shown that children seldom tire of them. The 
diet should be gradually increased by the addition of cooked 
fruits, vegetables, and simple desserts; the third or fourth 
year fish and meat may be introduced, if given sparingly. 
Always avoid salted meats, coarse vegetables (beets, carrots, 
and turnips), cheese, fried food, pastry, rich desserts, con- 
fections, condiments, tea, coffee, and iced water. For school 
children the diet should be varied and abundant, constantly 
bearing in mind that this is a period of great mental and 
physical growth. Where children have broken down, sup- 
posedly from over-work, the cause has often been traced to 
impoverished diet It must not be forgotten that diges- 
tive processes go on so rapidly that the stomach is soon 
emptied. Thanks to the iustitutor of the school luncheon- 
counter ! 

The daily average ration of an adult requires 

4*£ oz. proteid 18 oz. starch 

2 oz. fat 5 pints water 

About one-third of the water is taken in our food, the 
remainder as a beverage. To keep in health and do the 
best mental and physical work, authorities agree that a 
mixed diet is suited for temperate climates, although sound 
arguments appear from the vegetarian. Women, even though 
they do the same amount of work as men, as a rule require 
less food. Brain workers should take their proteid in a form 
easily digested. In consideration of this fact, fish and eggs 
form desirable substitutes for meat. The working man needs 
quantity as well as quality, that the stomach may have some- 
thing to act upon. Corned beef, cabbage, brown-bread, 
and pastry, will not overtax his digestion. In old age the 
digestive organs lessen in activity, and the diet should be 
almost as simple as that of a child, increasing the amount 
of carbohydrates and decreasing the amount of proteids 
and fat. Many diseases which occur after middle life are 
due to eating and drinking such foods as were indulged in 
during vigorous manhood.

WATER (H,0) 

Water is a transparent, odorless, tasteless liquid. It is 
derived from five sources, — rains, rivers, surface-water or 
shallow wells, deep wells, and springs. Water is never 
found pure'in nature; it is nearly pure when gathered in 
an open field, after a heavy rainfall, or from springs. For 
town and city supply, surface-water is furnished by some 
adjacent pond or lake. Samples of such water are carefully 
and frequeutly analyzed, to make sure that it is not polluted 
with disease germs. 

The hardness of water depends upon the amount of salts 
of lime and magnesia which it contains. Soft water is free 
from objectionable salts, and is preferable for household 
purposes. Hard water may be softened by boiling, or by 
the addition of a small amount of bicarbonate of soda 
(NaHC0 8 ). 

Water freezes at a temperature of 32° F., boils at 
212° F. ; when bubbles appear on the surface and burst, 
the boiling-point is reached. In high altitudes water boils 
at a lower temperature. From 32° to 6o° F. water is termed 
cold; from 65° to 92° F., tepid; 92° to 100° F., warm; over 
that temperature, hot. Boiled water is freed from all organic 
impurities, and salts of lime are precipitated; it does not 
ferment, and is a valuable antiseptic. Hot water is more 
stimulating than cold, and is of use taken on an empty 
stomach, while at a temperature of from 60° to 95° F. it 
is used as an emetic; 90° F. being the most favorable 
temperature. 

Distilled water is chemically pure and is always used for 
medicinal purposes. It is flat and insipid to the taste, hav- 
ing been deprived of its atmospheric gases. 

There are many charged, carboratcd, and mineral spring 
waters bottled and put on the market ; many of these are 
used as agreeable table beverages. Examples : Soda Water, 
Apollinaris, Poland, Seltzer, and Vichy. Some contain min- 
erals of medicinal value. Examples : Lithia, saline, and 
sulphur waters. 



STARCH 



SALTS 



Of all salts found in the body, the most abundant and 
valuable is sodium chloride (NaCl), common salt; it exists 
in all tissues, secretions, and fluids of the body, with the ex- 
ception of enamel of the teeth. The amount found in food 
is not always sufficient ; therefore salt is used as a condiment 
It assists digestion, inasmuch as it furnishes chlorine for 
hydrochloric acid found in gastric juice. 

Common salt is obtained from evaporation of spring and 
sea water, also from mines. Our supply of salt obtained 
by evaporation comes chiefly from Michigan and New York ; 
mined salt from Louisiana and Kansas. 

Salt is a great preservative ; advantage is taken of this in 
salting meat and fish. 

Other salts — lime, phosphorus, magnesia, potash, sul- 
phur, and iron — are obtained in sufficient quantity from 
food we eat and water we drink. In young children, perfect 
formation of bones and teeth depends upon phosphorus and 
lime taken into the system ; these are found in meat and fish, 
but abound in cereals. 

STABCH (C e H 10 O 6 ) 

Starch is a white, glistening powder; it is largely distrib- 
uted throughout the vegetable kingdom, being found most 
abundantly in cereals and potatoes. Being a force-producer 
and heat-giver it forms one of the most important foods. 
Alone it cannot sustain life, but must be taken in combina- 
tion with foods which build and repair tissues. 

Test for Starch. A weak solution of iodine added to col J 
cooked starch gives an intense blue color. 

Starch is insoluble in cold water, and soluble to but a 
small extent in boiling water. Cold water separates starch- 
grains, boiling water causes them to swell and burst, thus 
forming a paste. 

Starch subjected to dry heat is changed to dextrine 
(CaH 10 O 5 ), British gum. Dextrine subjected to heat plus an 



6 .BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

acid or a ferment is changed to dextrose (C 6 H 12 0«). Dextrose 
occurs in ripe fruit, honey, sweet wine, and as a manufactured 
product. When grain is allowed to germinate for malting 
purposes, starch is changed to dextrine and dextrose. In 
fermentation, dextrose is changed to alcohol (C 2 H 6 HO) and 
carbon dioxide (CO a ). Examples : bread making, vinegar, 
and distilled liquors. 

Glycogen, animal starch, is found in many animal tis- 
sues and in some fungi. Examples: in liver of meat and 
oysters. 

Raw starch is not digestible ; consequently all foods con- 
taining starch should be subjected to boiling water or dry 
heat, and thoroughly cooked. Starch is manufactured from 
wheat, corn, and potatoes. Cornstarch is manufactured 
from Indian corn. Arrowroot, the purest form of starch, is 
obtained from two or three species of the Maranta plant, 
which grows in the West Indies and other tropical countries. 
Bermuda arrowroot is most highly esteemed. Tapioca is 
starch obtained from tuberous roots of the bitter cassava, 
native of South America. Sago is starch obtained from sago 
palms, native of India. 

SUGAR (C 12 H 22 O a ) 

Sugar is a crystalline substance, differing from starch by 
its sweet taste and solubility in cold water. As food, its 
uses are the same as starch ; all starch must be converted 
into sugar before it can be assimilated. 

The principal kinds of sugar are : cane sugar or sucrose, 
grape sugar or glucose (C 6 H 12 6 ), milk sugar or lactose 
(Ci S H n Ou), and fruit sugar or levuhse (C 6 H 12 0«). 

Cane sugar is obtained from sugar cane, beets, and the 
palm and sugar-maple trees. Sugar cane is a grass sup- 
posed to be native to Southern Asia, but now grown 
throughout the tropics, a large amount coming from Cuba 
and Louisiana ; it is the commonest of all, and in all 
cases the manufacture is essentially the same. The prod- 
ucts of manufacture are: molasses, syrup, brown sugar, 
loaf, cut, granulated, powdered, and confectioners' sugar. 
Brown sugar is cheapest, but is not so pure or sweet as white 



GUM, PECTOSE, AND CELLULOSE 7 

grades ; powdered and confectioners' sugars are fine grades, 
pulverized, and, although seeming less sweet to the taste, 
are equally pure. Confectioners' sugar when applied to the 
tongue will dissolve at once ; powdered sugar is a little 
granular. 

Cane sugar when added to fruits, and allowed to cook for 
some time, changes to grape sugar, losing one-third of its 
sweetness ; therefore the reason for adding it when fruit is 
nearly cooked. Cane sugar is of great preservative value, 
hence its use in preserving fruits and milk; also, for the 
preparation of syrups. 

Three changes take place in the cooking of sugar : first, 
barley sugar ; second, caramel ; third, carbon. 

Grape sugar is found in honey and all sweet fruits. It 
appears on the outside of dried fruits, such as raisins, dates, 
etc., and is only two- thirds as sweet as cane sugar. As a 
manufactured product it is obtained from the starch of corn. 

Milk sugar is obtaiued from the milk of mammalia, but 
unlike cane sugar does not ferment. 

Fruit sugar is obtained from sweet fruits, and is sold as 
diabetin, is sweeter than cane sugar, and is principally used 
by diabetic patients. 

GUM, PECTOSE, AND CELLULOSE 

These compounds found in food are closely allied to the 
carbohydrates, but are neither starchy, saccharine, nor oily. 
Gum exists in the juices of almost all plants, coming from 
the stems, branches, and fruits. Examples : gum arabic, 
gnm tragacanth, and mucilage. Pectose exists in the fleshy 
pulp of unripe fruit; during the process of ripening it 
changes to pectin ; by cooking, pectin is changed to pectosic 
acid, and by longer cooking to pectic acid. Pectosic acid is 
jelly-like when cold ; pectic acid is jelly-like when hot or 
cold. Cellulose constitutes the cell-walls of vegetable life ; 
in very young vegetables it is possible that it can be acted 
upon by the digestive ferments ; in older vegetables it be- 
comes woody and completely indigestible.

FATS AND OILS 

Fats and oils are found in both the animal and vegetable 
kingdom. Fats are solid ; oils are liquid ; they may be con- 
verted into a liquid state by application of heat ; they contain 
three substauces, — stearin (solid), olein (liquid), palmitin 
(semi-solid). Suet is an example where stearin is found in 
excess ; lard, where olien is in excess ; and butter, where pal- 
mitin is in excess. Margarin is a mixture of stearin and 
palmitin. The fatty acids are formed of stearin, olein, 
and palmitin, with glycerine as the base. Examples : stearic, 
palmitic, and oleic acid. Butyric acid is acid found in but- 
ter. These are not sour to the taste, but are called acids on 
account of their chemical composition. 

Among animal fats cream and butter are of first impor- 
tance as foods, on account of their easy assimilation. Other 
examples are : the fat of meats, bone- marrow, suet (the 
best found around the loin and kidneys of the beef creature), 
lard, cottolene, coto suet, cocoanut butter, butterine, and 
oleomargarine. The principal animal oils are cod-liver oil 
and oil found in the yolk of egg ; principal vegetable oils 
are olive, cottonseed, poppy, and cocoanut oils, and oils 
obtained from various nuts. 

Oils are divided into two classes, essential &u(\ fixed. Es- 
sential oils are volatile and soluble in alcohol. Examples : 
clove, rose, nutmeg, and violet. Fixed oils are non-volatile 
and soluble in ether, oil, or turpentine. Examples : oil of 
nuts, corn meal, and mustard. 

Fats may be heated to a high temperature, as considered 
in cookery they have no boiling-point. When appearing to 
boil, it is evident water has been added, and the temperature 
lowered to that of boiling water, 212° F.

Boston Chemist, 

The value of milk as a food is obvious from the fact that 
it constitutes the natural food of all young mammalia during 
the period of their most rapid growth. There is some danger, 
however, of overestimating its value in the dietary of adults, 
as solid food is essential, and liquid taken should act as a 
stimulant and a solvent rather than as a nutrient. One ob- 
tains the greatest benefit from milk when taken alone at reg- 
ular intervals between meals, or before retiring, and sipped, 
rather than drunk. Hot milk is often given to produce 
sleep. 

When milk is allowed to stand for a few hours, the globules 
of fat, which have been held in suspension throughout the 
liquid, rise to the top in the form of cream; this is due to 
their lower specific gravity. 

The difference in quality of milk depends chiefly on the 
quantity of fat therein : casein, lactose, and mineral matter 
being nearly constant, water varying but little unless milk 
is adulterated. 

Why Milk Sours. A germ found floating in the air at- 
tacks a portion of the lactose in the milk, converting, it into 
lactic acid; this, in turn, acts upon the casein (proteid) and 
precipitates it, producing what is known as curd and whey. 
Whey contains water, salts, and some sugar. 

Milk is preserved by sterilization, pasteurization, and evap- 
oration. Fresh condensed milk, a form of evaporized milk, 
is sold in bulk, and is preferred by many to serve with coffee. 
Various brands of condensed milk and cream are on the mar- 
ket in tin cans, hermetically sealed. Examples: Nestle's 
Swiss Condensed Milk, Eagle Condensed Milk, Daisy Con- 
densed Milk, Highland Evaporated Cream, Borden's Peerless 
Evaporated Cream. Malted milk — evaporized milk in com- 



10 BOSTON COOKING SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

bination with extracts of malted barley and wheat — is used 
to a considerable extent ; it is sold in the form of powder. 

Thin, or strawberry, and thick cream may be obtained 
from almost all creameries. Devonshire, or clotted cream, 
is cream which has been removed from milk allowed to heat 
slowly to a temperature of about 150° F. 

In feeding infants with milk, sterilization or pasteurization 
is sometimes recommended to avoid danger of infectious 
germs. By this process milk can be kept for many days, 
and transported if necessary. To prevent acidity of the 
stomach, add from one to two teaspoonfuls of lime water to 
each half-pint of milk. Lime water may be bought at any 
druggist's, or easily prepared at home. 

Lime Water. Pour two quarts boiling water over an inch 
cube unslacked lime; stir thoroughly and stand over night; 
in the morning pour off the liquid that is clear, and bottle for 
use. Keep in a cool place. 

BUTTER

Pratt Institute. 

Butter of commerce is made from cream of cow's milk. 
The quality depends upon the breed of cow, manner of, and 
care in, feeding. Milk from Jersey and Guernsey cows yields 
the largest amount of butter. 

Butter should be kept in a cool place and well covered, 
otherwise it is liable to become rancid; this is due to the 
albuminous constituents of the milk, acting as a ferment, 
settiug free the fatty acids. First-quality butter should 
be used; this does not include pat butter or fancy grades. 
Poor butter has not been as thoroughly worked during man- 
ufacture, consequently more casein remains ; therefore it is 
more apt to become rancid. Fresh butter spoils quickly; 
salt acts as a preservative. Butter which has become rancid 
by too long keeping may be greatly improved by melting,

heating, and quickly chilling with ice-water. The butter will 
rise to the top, and may be easily removed. 

Where butter cannot be afforded, there are several products 
on the market which have the same chemical composition as 
butter, and are equally wholesome. Examples : butterine 
and oleomargarine. 

Buttermilk is liquid remaining after butter " has come." 
When -taken fresh, it makes a wholesome beverage. 

CHEESE 

COMPOSITION

Cheese is the solid part of sweet milk obtained by heating 
milk and coagulating it by means of rennet or an acid. Ren- 
net is an infusion made from prepared inner membrane of 
the fourth stomach of the calf. The curd is salted and sub- 
jected to pressure. Cheese is made from skim milk, milk plus 
cream, or cream. Cheese is kept for a longer or shorter 
time, according to the kind, that fermentation or decompo- 
sition may take place. This is called ripening. Some cream 
cheeses are not allowed to ripen. Milk from Jersey and 
Guernsey cows yields the largest amount of cheese. 

Cheese is very valuable food ; being rich in proteid, it 
may be used as a substitute for meat. A pound of cheese 
is equal in proteid to two pounds of beef. Cheese in the raw 
state is difficult of digestion. This is somewhat overcome 
by cooking and adding a small amount of bicarbonate of 
soda. A small piece of rich cheese is often eaten to assist 
digestion. 

The various brands of cheese take their names from the 
places where made. Many foreign ones are now well imi- 
tated in this country. The favorite kinds of skim-milk 
cheese are: Edam, Gruyere, and Parmesan. Parmesan is 
very hard and used principally for grating. The holes in 
Gxuyere are due to aeration. 

The favorite kinds of milk cheese are : Gloucester, Che*

shire, Cheddar, and Gorgonzola ; Milk and Cream cheese : 
Stilton and Double Gloucester ; Cream cheese : Brie, Neuf- 
chatel, and Camembert. 

FRUITS 

The varieties of fruits consumed are numerous, and their 
uses important. They are chiefly valuable for their sugar, 
acids, and salts, and are cooling, refreshing, and stimulating. 
They act as a tonic, and assist in purifying the blood. Many 
contain a jelly-like substance, called pectin, and several con- 
tain starch, which during the ripening process is converted 
into glucose. Bananas, dates, figs, prunes, and grapes, 
owing to their large amount of sugar, are the most nutritious. 
Melons, oranges, lemons, and grapes contain the largest 
amount of water. Apples, lemons, and oranges are valuable 
for their potash salts, and oranges and lemons especially 
valuable for their citric acid. It is of importance to those 
who are obliged to exclude much sugar from their dietary, 
to know that plums, peaches, apricots, and raspberries have 
less sugar than other fruits ; apples, sweet cherries, grapes, 
and pears contain the largest amount. Apples are obtain- 
able nearly all the year, and on account of their variety, 
cheapness, and abundance, are termed queen of fruits. 

Thoroughly ripe fruits should be freely indulged in, and 
to many are more acceptable than desserts prepared in the 
kitchen. If possible, fruits should always appear on the 
breakfast-table. In cases where uncooked fruit cannot be 
freely eaten, many kinds may be cooked and prove valuable. 
Never eat unripe fruit, or that which is beginning to decay. 
Fruits should be wiped or rinsed before serving. 

VEGETABLE ACIDS, AND WHERE FOUND 
The principal vegetable acids are : 

I. Acetic (HC a H 8 9 ), found in wine and vinegar. 

II. Tartaric (H 8 C 4 H 4 O e ), found in grapes, pineapples, 
and tamarinds. 

III. Malic, much like tartaric, found in apples, pears, 
peaches, apricots, gooseberries, and currants. 



CONDIMENTS 13 

IV. Citric (H 8 C e H 5 7 ), found in lemons, oranges, limes, 
and citron. 

V. Oxalic (H 2 C*0 4 ), fonnd in rhubarb and sorrel. 

To these may be added tannic acid, obtained from gall 
nuts. Some fruits contain two or more acids. Malic and 
citric are found in strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, 
and cherries ; malic, citric, and oxalic in cranberries. 

CONDIMENTS 

Condiments are not classed among foods, but are known 
as food adjuncts. They are used to stimulate the appetite 
by adding flavor to food. Among the most important are 
salt, spices, and various flavorings. Salt, according to some 
authorities, is called a food, being necessary to life. 

Black pepper is ground peppercorns. Peppercorns are 
the dried berries of Pipor nigrum, grown in the West Indies, 
Sumatra, and other eastern countries. 

White pepper is made from the same berry, the outer husk 
being removed before grinding. It is less irritating than 
black pepper to the coating of the stomach. 

Cayenne pepper is the powdered pod of Capsicum grown 
on the eastern coast of Africa and in Zanzibar. 

Mustard is the ground seed of two species of the Brassica. 
Brassica alba yields white mustard seeds; Brassica nigra, 
black mustard seeds. Both species are grown in Europe and 
America. 

Ginger is the pulverized dried root of Zanzibar officinale, 
grown in Jamaica, China, and India. Commercially speak* 
ing, there are three grades, — Jamaica, best and strongest ; 
Cochin, and African. 

Cinnamon is the ground inner bark of Cinnamomum zey- 
lanicum, principally grown in Ceylon. The cinnamon of 
commerce (cassia) is the powdered bark of different species 
of the same shrub, which is principally grown in China, and 
called Chinese cinnamon. It is cheaper than true cinnamon. 
Clove is the ground flower buds of Caryophyllus aromati- 
cus<, native to the Moluccas or Spice Islands, but now grown 
principally in Zanzibar, Pemba, and the West Indies. 



14 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Pimento (commonly called allspice) is the ground fruit of 
Eugenia pimento, grown in Jamaica and the West Indies. 

Kutmeg is the kernel of the fruit of the Myristica frar 
grans, grown in Banda Islands. 

Mace. The fibrous network which envelops the nutmeg 
seed constitutes the mace of commerce. 

Vinegar is made from apple cider, malt, and wine, and is 
the product of fermentation. It is a great perservative ; 
hence its use in the making of pickles, sauces, and other 
condiments. The amount of acetic acid in vinegar varies 
from two to seven per cent 

Capers are flower buds of Capparis spinosa, grown in 
countries bordering the Mediterranean. They are preserved 
in vinegar, and bottled for importation. 

Horse-radish is the root of Cochliaria armoracia, — a plant 
native to Europe, but now grown in our own country. It is 
generally grated, mixed with vinegar, and bottled. 

FLAVORING EXTRACTS 

Many flavoring extracts are on the market Examples: 
almond, vanilla, lemon, orange, peach, and rose. These 
are made from the flower, fruit, or seed from which they are 
named. Strawberry, pineapple, and banana extracts are 
manufactured from chemicals.

CHAPTER n 

COOK&RY 

COOKERY is the art of preparing food for the nourish- 
ment of the body. 

Prehistoric man may have lived on uncooked foods, but 
there are no savage races to-day who do not practise cookery 
in some way, however crude. Progress in civilization has 
been accompanied by progress in cookery. 

Much time has been given in the last few years to the 
study of foods, their necessary proportions, and manner of 
cooking them. Educators have been shown by scientists 
that this knowledge should be disseminated ; as a result, 
'* Cookery" is found in the curriculum of public schools of 
many of our towns and cities. 

Food is cooked to develop new flavors, to make it more 
palatable and digestible, and to destroy micro-organisms. 
For cooking there are three essentials (besides the material 
to be cooked), — heat, air, and moisture. 

Heat is molecular motion, and is produced by combustion. 
Heat used for cookery is obtained by the combustion of in- 
flammable substances — wood, coal, charcoal, coke, gas, 
gasoline, kerosene, and alcohol — called fuels. Heat for 
cookery is applied by radiation, conduction, and convection. 

Air is composed of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, and 
surrounds everything. Combustion cannot take place with- 
out it, the oxygen of the air being the only supporter of 
combustion. 

Motetare, in the form of water, either found in the food 
to added to it. 

The combined effect of heat and moisture swells and 
bursts- stareh-grains ; hardens albumen in eggs, fish, and 
neat; softens fibrous portions of meat, and cellulose of 
vegetables. 



16 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Among fuels, kerosene oil is the cheapest ; gas gives the 
greatest amount of heat in the shortest time. Soft wood % 
like pine, on account of its coarse fibre, burns quickly; 
therefore makes the best kindling. Hard wood, like oak 
and ash, having the fibres closely packed, burns slowly, and 
is used in addition to pine wood for kindling coal. Where 
only wood is used as a fuel, it is principally hard wood. 

Charcoal for fuel is produced by the smothered combus- 
tion of wood. It gives an intense, even heat, therefore makes 
a good broiling fire. Its use for kindling is not infrequent. 

There are two kinds of coal: Anthracite, or hard coal. 
Examples : Hard and free-burning White Ash, Shamokin, 
and Franklin. Nut is any kind of hard coal obtained from 
screenings. Bituminous, or soft coal. Example: cannel 
coal. 

Coke is the solid product of carbonized coal, and bears 
the same relation to coal that charcoal bears to wood. 

Alcohol is employed as fuel when the chafing-dish is used. 

fibe 

Fire for cookery is confined in a stove or range, so that 
heat may be utilized and regulated. Flame-heat is obtained 
from kerosene, gas, or alcohol, as used in oil-stoves, gus- 
stoves or gas-ranges, and chafing-dishes. 

A cooking-stove is a large iron box set on legs. It has a 
fire-box in the front, the sides of which are lined with fire- 
proof material similar to that of which bricks are made. 
The bottom is furnished with a movable iron grate. Under- 
neath the fire-box is a space which extends from the grate to 
a pan for receiving ashes. At the back of fire-box is a com- 
partment called the oven, accessible on each side of the stove 
by a door. Between the oven and the top of the stove is a 
space for the circulation of air. 

Stoves are connected with chimney-flues by means of a 
stovepipe, and have dampers to regulate the supply of air 
and heat, and as an outlet for smoke and gases. 

The damper below the fire-box is known as the front 
damper j by means of which the air supply is regulated, thus 
regulating the heat 



HOW TO BUILD A FIRE 17 

The oven is heated by a circulation of hot air. This is 
accomplished by closing the oven-damper, which is situated 
near the oven. When this damper is left open, the hot air 
rushes up the chimney. The damper near the chimney is 
known as the chimney-damper. When open it gives a free 
outlet for the escape of smoke and gas. When partially 
closed, as is usually the case in most ranges, except when 
the fire is started, it serves as a saver of heat. There is 
also a check, which, when open, cools the fire and saves heat, 
but should always be closed except when used for this 
purpose. 

Stoves are but seldom used, portable ranges having taken 
their places. 

A portable range is a cooking-stove with one oven door ; 
it often has an under oven, of use for warming dishes and 
keeping food hot. 

A set range is built in a fireplace. It usually has two 
ovens, one on each side of the fire-box, or two above it at 
the back. Set ranges, as they consume so large an amount 
of fuel, are being replaced by portable ones. 

HOW TO BUILD A FIEE 

Before starting to build a fire, free the grate from ashes. 
To do this, put on covers, close front and back dampers, 
and open oven-damper ; turn grate, and ashes will fall into 
the ash receiver. If these rules are not followed, ashes will 
fly over the room. Turn grate back into place, remove the 
covers over fire-box, and cover grate with pieces of paper 
(twisted in centre and left loose at the ends). Cover paper 
with small sticks, or pieces of pine wood, being sure that 
the wood reaches the ends of fire-box, and so arranged that 
it will admit air. Over pine wood arrange hard wood ; 
then sprinkle with two shovelfuls of coal. Put on covers, 
open closed dampers, strike a match, — sufficient friction is 
formed to burn the phosphorus, this in turn lights the sul- 
phur, and the sulphur the wood, — then apply the lighted 
match under the grate, and you have a fire. 

Now blacken the stove. Begin at front of range, and 



18 BOSTON OOOKING-SOHOOL COOK BOOK 

work towards the back; as the iron heats, a good polish 
may be obtained. When the wood is thoroughly kindled, 
add more coal. A blue flame will soon appear, which is the 
gas (CO) in the coal burning to carbon dioxide (C0 3 ), when 
the blue flame changes to a white flame ; then the oven- 
damper should be closed. In a few moments the front 
damper may be nearly closed, leaving space to admit suffi- 
cient oxygen to feed the Are. It is sometimes forgotten that 
oxygen is necessary to keep a fire burning. As soon as the 
coal is well ignited, half close the chimney-damper, unless 
the draft be very poor. 

Never allow the firebox to be more than three-fourths 
filled. When full, the draft is checked, a larger amount of 
fuel is consumed, and much heat is lost. This is a point 
that should be impressed on the mind of the cook. 

Ashes must be removed and sifted daily ; pick over and 
save good coals, — which are known as cinders, — throwing 
out useless pieces, known as clinkers. 

If a fire is used constantly during the day, replenish coal 
frequently, but in small quantities. If for any length of 
time the fire is not needed, open check, the dampers being 
closed ; when again wanted for use, close check, open front 
damper, and with a poker rake out ashes from under fire, 
and wait for fire to burn brightly before adding new coal. 

Coal when red hot has parted with most of its heat. 
Some refuse to believe this, and insist upon keeping dampers 
open until most of the heat has escaped into the chimney. 

To keep a fire over night, remove the ashes from under the 
fire, put on enough coal to fill the box, close the dampers, 
and lift the back covers enough to admit air. This is better 
than lifting the covers over the fire-box and prevents poison- 
ous gases entering the room. 

WATS OF COOKING 

The principal ways of cooking are boiling, broiling, 
stewing, roasting, baking, frying, sauteing, braising, and 
fi'icasseeing. 

Boiling is cooking in boiling water. Solid food so cooked 



WAYS OP COOKING 19 

is called boiled food, though literally this expression is in- 
correct. Examples : boiled eggs, potatoes, mutton, etc. 

Water boils at 212° F. (sea level), and simmers at 185° F. 
Slowly boiling water has the same temperature as rapidly 
boiling water, consequently is able to do the same work, — 
a fact often forgotten by the cook, who is too apt " to wood " 
the fire that water may boil vigorously. 

Watery vapor and steam pass off from boiling water. 
Steam is invisible ; watery vapor is visible, and is often mis- 
called steam. Cooking utensils commonly used admit the 
escape of watery vapor and steam ; thereby much heat is lost 
if food is cooked in rapidly boiling water. 

Water is boiled for two purposes : first, cooking of itself 
to destroy organic impurities; second, for cooking foods. 
Boiling water toughens and hardens albumen in eggs ; 
toughens fibrin and dissolves tissues in meat ; bursts starch- 
grains and softens cellulose in cereals and vegetables. Milk 
should never be allowed to boil. At boiling temperature 
(214° F.) the casein is slightly hardened, and the fat is ren- 
dered more difficult of digestion. Milk heated over boiling 
water, as in a double boiler, is called scalded milk, and 
reaches a temperature of 196° F. When foods are cooked 
over hot water the process is called steaming. 

Stewing is cooking in a small amount of hot water for a 
long time at low temperature ; it is the most economical way 
of cooking meats, as all nutriment is retained, and the 
ordinary way of cooking cheaper cuts. Thus fibre and con- 
nective tissues are softened, and the whole is made tender 
and palatable. 

Broiling is cooking over or in front of a clear fire. The 
food to be cooked is usually placed in a greased broiler or on 
a gridiron held near the coals, turned often at first to sear 
the outside, — thus preventing escape of inner Juices, — 
afterwards turned occasionally. Tender meats and fish may 
be cooked in this way. The flavor obtained by broiling is 
particularly fine ; there is, however, a greater loss of weight 
in this than in any other way of cooking, as the food thus 
cooked is exposed to free circulation of air. When coal is 
not used, of a fire is not in condition for broiling, a plan for 



20 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

pan broiling has been adopted. This is done by placing food 
to be cooked in a hissing hot frying-pan, turning often as in 
broiling. 

Roasting is cooking before a clear fire, with a reflector to 
concentrate the heat Heat is applied in the same way as 
for broiling, the difference being that the meat for roasting 
is placed on a spit and allowed to revolve, thicker pieces 
alway being employed. Tin-kitchens are now but seldom 
used. Meats cooked in a range oven, though really baked, 
are said to be roasted. Meats so cooked are pleasing to the 
sight and agreeable to the palate, although, according to 
Edward Atkinson, not so easily digested as when cooked at 
a lower temperature in the Aladdin oven. 

Baking is cooking in a range oven. 

Frying is cooking by means of immersion in deep fat 
raised to a temperature of 850° to 400° F. For frying pur- 
poses olive oil, lard, beef drippings, cottolene, coto suet, and 
cocoanut butter are used. A combination of two- thirds lard 
and one- third beef suet (tried out and clarified) is better than 
lard alone. Cottolene, coto suet, and cocoanut butter are 
economical, inasmuch as they may be heated to a high tem- 
perature without discoloring, therefore may be used for a 
larger number of fryings. Cod fat obtained from beef is 
often used by chefs for frying. 

Great care should be taken in frying that fat is of the 
right temperature; otherwise food so cooked will absorb 
fat. 

Nearly all foods which do not contain eggs are dipped 
in flour or crumbs, egg, and crumbs, before frying. The in- 
tense heat of fat hardens the albumen, thus forming a coating 
which prevents food from " soaking fat." 

When meat or fish is to be fried, it should be kept in a 
warm room for some time previous to cooking, and wiped 
as dry as possible. If cold, it decreases the temperature 
of the fat to such extent that a coating is not formed 
quickly enough to prevent fat from penetrating the food. 
The ebullition of fat is due to water found in food to be 
cooked. 

Great care must be taken that too much is not put into 



WAYS OP COOKING 21 

the fat at one time, not only because it lowers the tem- 
perature of the fat, but because it causes it to bubble and 
go over the sides of the kettle. It is not fat that boils, but 
water which fat has received from food. 

All fried food on removal from fat should be rained on 
brown paper. 

Rules for Testing Fat for Frying. 1. When the fat 
begins to smoke, drop in an inch cube of bread from soft 
part of loaf, and if in forty seconds it is golden brown, the 
fat is then of right temperature for frying any cooked 
mixture. 

2. Use same test for uncooked mixtures, allowing one 
minute for bread to brown. 

Many kinds of food may be fried in the same fat; new 
fat should be used for batter and dough mixtures, potatoes, 
and fishballs ; after these, fish, meat, and croquettes. Fat 
should be frequently clarified. 

To Clarify Fat. Melt fat, add raw potato cut in quarter- 
inch slices, and allow fat to heat gradually ; when fat ceases 
to bubble and potatoes are well browned, strain through 
double cheesecloth, placed over wire strainer, into a pan. 
The potato absorbs any odors or gases, and collects to itself 
some of the sediment, remainder settling to bottom of 
kettle. 

When small amount of fat is to be clarified, add to cold 
fat boiling water, stir vigorously, and set aside to cool ; the 
fat will form a cake on top, which may be easily removed ; 
on bottom of the cake will be found sediment, which may be 
readily scraped off with a knife. 

Remnants of fat, either cooked or uncooked, should be 
saved and tried out, and when necessary clarified. 

Fat from beef, poultry, chicken, and pork, may be used 
for shortening or frying purposes; fat from mutton and 
smoked meats may be used for making hard and soft soap ; 
fat removed from soup stock, the water in which corned 
beef has been cooked, and drippings from roast beef, may 
be tried out, clarified, and used for shortening or frying 
purposes. 

To Try out Fat. Cut in small pieces and melt in top of 



22 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

a double boiler; in this way it will require less watching 
than if placed in kettle on the back of range. Leaf lard 
is tried out in the same way; in cutting the leaf, remove 
membrane. After straining lard, that which remains may 
be salted, pressed, and eaten as a relish, and is called 
scraps. 

Sautling is frying in a small quantity of fat Food so 
cooked is much more difficult of digestion than when fried 
in deep fat ; it is impossible to cook in this way without the 
food absorbing fat A frying-pan or griddle is used; the 
food is cooked on one side, then turned, and cooked on 
the other. 

Braising is stewing and baking (meat). Meat to be 
braised is frequently first sauted to prevent escape of much 
juice in the gravy. The meat is placed in a pan with a small 
quantity of stock or water, vegetables (carrot, turnip, celery, 
and union) cut in pieces, salt, pepper, and sweet herbs. The 
pan should have a tight-fitting cover. Meat so prepared 
should be cooked in an oven at low uniform temperature for 
a long time. This is an economical way of cooking, and the 
only way besides stewing or boiling of making a large piece 
of tough meat palatable and digestible. 

Fricasseeing is sauteing and serving with a sauce. Ten- 
der meat is fricasseed without previous cooking ; less tender 
meat requires cooking in hot water before fricasseeing. 
Although veal is obtained from a young creature, it requires 
long cooking; it is usually sauted, and then cooked in a 
sauce at low temperature for a long time. 

VARIOUS WATS OF PREPARING FOOD FOE 

COOKING 

Egging and Crumbing. Use for crumbing dried bread 
crumbs which have been rolled and sifted, or soft stale 
bread broken in pieces and forced through a colander. An 
ingenious machine on the market, u The Bread Crumber," 
does this work. Egg used for crumbing should be broken 
into a shallow plate and beaten with a silver fork to blend 
yolk and white; dilute each egg with two tablespoons 



WAYS OP PREPARING FOOD FOR COOKING 23 

water. The crumbs should .be taken on a board ; food to be 
fried should be first rolled in crumbs (care being taken that 
all parts are covered with crumbs), then dipped in egg 
mixture (equal care being taken to cover all parts), then 
roiled in crumbs again ; after the last crumbing remove food 
to a place on the board where there are no crumbs, and 
shake off some of the outer ones which make coating too 
thick. A broad-bladed knife with short handle — the Teller 
knife — is the most convenient utensil for liftiug food to be 
crumbed from egg mixture. Small scallops, oysters, and 
crabs are more easily crumbed by putting crumbs and fish 
in paper and shaking paper until the fish is covered with 
crumbs. The object of first crumbing is to dry the surface 
that egg may cling to it; and where a thin coating is desired 
flour is often used in place of crumbs. 

Larding is introducing small pieces of fat salt pork or 
bacon through the surface of uncooked meat. The flavor 
of lean and dry meat is much improved by larding ; tender- 
loin of beef (fillet), grouse, partridge, pigeon, and liver are 
often prepared in this way. Pig pork being firm, is best 
for larding. Pork should be kept in a cold place that it may 
be well chilled. Remove rind and use the part of pork 
which lies between rind and vein. With sharp knife (which 
is sure to make a clean cut) remove slices a little less than* 
one-fourth inch thick; cut the slices into strips a little less 
than one-fourth inch wide ; these strips should be two and 
one-fourth inches long, and are called lardoons. Lardoons 
for small birds — quail, for example — should be cut smaller 
and not quite so long. To lard, insert one end of lardoon 
into larding- needle, hold needle firmly, and with pointed end 
take up a stitch one-third inch deep and three-fourths inch 
wide ; draw needle through, care being taken that lardoon is 
left in meat and its ends project to equal lengths. Arrange 
lardoons in parallel rows, one inch apart, stitches in the 
alternate rows being directly underneath each other. Lard 
the upper surface of cuts of meat with the grain, never 
across it. In birds, insert lardoons at right angles to breast- 
bone on either side. When large lardoons are forced 
through meat from surface to surface, the process is called

daubing. Example: Beef a la mode. Thin slices of fat 
salt pork placed oyer meat may be substituted for larding, 
but flavor is not the same as when pork is drawn through 
flesh, and the dish is far less sightly. 

Boning is removing bones from meat or fish, leaving the 
flesh nearly in its original shape. For boning, a small 
sharp knife with pointed blade is essential. Legs of mutton 
and veal and loins of beef may be ordered boned at market, 
no extra charge being made. 

Whoever wishes to learn how to bone should first be 
taught boning of a small bird ; when this is accomplished, 
larger birds, chickens, and turkeys may easily be done, 
the processes varying but little. In large birds tendons 
are drawn from legs, and the wings are left on and boned. 

How to Bone a Bird 

In buying birds for boning, select those which have been 
fresh killed, dry picked, and not drawn. Singe, remove 
pinfeathers, head, and feet, and cut off wings close to body. 
Lay bird on a board, breast down. 

Begin at neck and with sharp knife cut through the 
skin the entire length of body. Scrape the flesh from back- 
bone until end of one shoulder-blade is found ; scrape flesh 
from shoulder-blade and continue around wing-Joint, cutting 
through tendinous portions which are encountered; then 
bone other side. Scrape skin from backbone the entire 
length of body, working across the ribs. Free wishbone 
and collar-bones, at same time removing crop and windpipe ; 
continue down breastbone, particular care being taken not 
to break the skin as it lies very near bone, or to cut the 
delicate membranes which enclose entrails. Scrape flesh 
from second joints and drumsticks, laying it back and 
drawing off as a glove may be drawn from the hand. 
Withdraw carcass and put flesh back in its original shape. 
In large birds where wings are boned, scrape flesh to middle 
joint, where bone should be broken, leaving bone at tip end 
to assist in preserving shape. 



HOW TO MEASURE 25 

How to Measure 

Correct measurements are absolutely necessary to insure 
the best results. Good judgment, with experience, has 
taught some to measure by sight; but the majority need 
definite guides. 

Tin. granite-ware, and glass measuring-cups, divided in 
quarters or thirds, holding one half-pint, and tea and table 
spoons of regulation sizes, — which may be bought at any 
store where kitchen furnishings are sold, — and a case knife, 
are essentials for correct measurement Mixing-spoons, 
which are little larger than tablespoons, should not be con- 
founded with the latter. 

Measuring Ingredients. Flour, meal, powdered and con- 
fectioners' sugar, and soda should be sifted before measur- 
ing. Mustard and baking-powder, from standing in boxes, 
settle, therefore should be stirred to lighten ; salt frequently 
lumps, and these lumps should be broken. A cupful is meas- 
ured level. To measure a cupful, put in the ingredient by 
spoonfuls or from a scoop, round slightly, and level with 
a case knife, care being taken not to shake the cup. A 
tabtespoonful is measured level. A teaspoonful is measured 
level. 

To measure tea or table spoonfuls, dip the spoon in the 
ingredient, fill, lift, and level witli a knife, the sharp edge 
of knife being toward tip of spoon. Divide with knife 
lengthwise of spoon, for a half-spoonful; divide halves 
crosswise for quarters, and quarters crosswise for eighths. 
Less than one-eighth of a teaspoonful is considered a few 
grains. 

Measuring Liquids. A cupful of liquid is all the cup will 
hold. 

A tea or table spoonful is all the spoon will hold. 

Measuring Butter, Lard, etc. To measure butter, lard, 
and other solid fats, pack solidly into cup or spoon, and 
level with a knife. 

When dry ingredients, liquids, and fats are called for 
in the same recipe, measure in the order given, thereby 
using but one cup. 



26 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

How to Combine Ingredients 

Next to measuring comes care in combining, — a fact 
not always recognized by the inexperienced. Three ways 
are considered, — stirring, beating, and cutting and folding. 

To stir, mix by using circular motion, widening the circles 
until all is blended. Stirring is the motion ordinarily em- 
ployed in all cookery, alone or in combination with beating. 

To beat, turn ingredient or ingredients over and over, 
continually bringing the under part to the surface, thus 
allowing the utensil used for beating to be constantly 
brought in contact with bottom of the dish and throughout 
the mixture. 

To cut and fold, introduce one ingredient into another 
ingredient or mixture by two motions: with a spoon, a 
repeated vertical downward motion, known as cutting ; and 
a turning over and over of mixture, allowing bowl of spoon 
each time to come in contact with bottom of dish, is 
called folding. These repeated motions are alternated until 
thorough blending is accomplished. 

By stirring, ingredients are mixed; by beating, a large 
amount of air is inclosed ; by cutting and folding, air already 
introduced is prevented from escaping. 

Ways of Preserving 

1. By Freezing. Foods which spoil readily are frozen 
for transportation, and must be kept packed in ice until 
used. Examples : Fish and poultry. 

2. By Refrigeration. Foods so preserved are kept in 
cold storage. The cooling is accomplished by means of 
ice, or by a machine where compressed gas is cooled and 
then permitted to expand. Examples : meat, milk, butter, 
eggs, etc. 

3. By Canning. Which is preserving in air-tight glass 
jars, or tin cans hermetically sealed. When fruit is canned, 
sugar is usually added. 

4. By Sugar. Examples: fruit-juices and condensed 
milk. 

5. By Exclusion of Air. Foods are preserved by ex- 



TABLE OF MEA80RE8 AND WEIGHTS 27 

elusion of air in other ways than canning. Examples: 
grapes in bran, eggs in lime water, etc. 

6. By Drying. Drying consists in evaporation of nearly 
all moisture, and is generally combined with salting, except 
in vegetables and fruits. 

7. By Evaporation. There are examples where con- 
siderable moisture remains, though much is driven off. 
Example : beef extract. 

8. By Baiting. There are two kinds of salting, — dry, 
and corning or salting in brine. Examples : salt codfish, 
beef, pork, tripe, etc. 

9. By Smoking. Some foods, after being salted, are 
huqg in a closed room for several hours, where hickory 
wood is allowed to smother. Examples: ham, beef, and 
fish. 

10. By Piokling. Vinegar, to which salt is added, and 
sometimes sugar and spices, is scalded; and cucumbers, 
onions, and various kinds of fruit are allowed to remain 
in it. 

11. By Oil. Examples: sardines, anchovies, etc. 

12. By Antiseptics. The least wholesome way is by 
the use of antiseptics. Borax and salicylic acid, when 
employed, should be used sparingly.

CHAPTER III 

BEVERAGES 

A BEVERAGE is any drink. Water is the beverage 
provided for man by Nature. Water is an essential 
to life. All beverages contain a large percentage of water, 
therefore their uses should be considered : — 

I. To quench thirst. 
II. To introduce water into the circulatory system. 

III. To regulate body temperature. 

IV. To assist in carrying off waste. 
V. To nourish. 

VI. To stimulate the nervous system and various organs. 
VII. For medicinal purposes 

Freshly boiled water should be used for making hot bev- 
erages ; freshly drawn water for making cold beverages. 

TEA 

Tea is used by more than one-half the human race; 
and, although the United States is not a tea-drinking 
country, one and one-half pounds are consumed per capita 
per annum. 

All tea is grown from one species of shrub, Thea, the 
leaves of which constitute the tea of commerce. Climate, 
elevation, soil, cultivation, and care in picking and cur- 
ing all go to make up the differences. First-quality tea 
is made from young, whole leaves. Two kinds of tea are 
considered : —  

Black tea, made from leaves which have been allowed 
to ferment before curing. 

Green tea, made from unfermented leaves artificially 
colored. 



TEA 33 

The best black tea comes from India and Ceylon. Some 
familiar brands aie Oolong, Formosa, English Breakfast, 
Orange Pekoe, and Flowery Pekoe. The last two named, 
often employed at the "five o'clock tea/ 1 command high 
prices; they are made from the youngest leaves. Orange 
Pekoe is scented with orange leaves. The best green tea 
comes from Japan. Some familiar brands are Hyson, 
Japan, and Gunpowder. 

From analysis, it has been found that tea is rich in 
proteid, but taken as an infusion acts as a stimulant 
rather than as a nutrient. The nutriment is gained from 
sugar and milk served with it. The stimulating property of 
tea is due to the alkaloid, theine, together with an essential 
oil; it contains an astringent, tannin. Black tea contains 
less theine, essential oil, and tannin than green tea. The 
tannic acid, developed from the tannin by infusion, injures 
the coating of the stomach. 

Although tea is not a substitute for food, it appears so 
for a considerable period of time, as its stimulating effect 
is immediate. It is certain that less food is required where 
much tea is taken, for by its use there is less wear of the 
tissues, consequently need of repair. When taken to excess, 
it so acts on the nervous system as to produce sleeplessness 
or insomnia, and finally makes a complete wreck of its 
victim. Taken in moderation, it acts as a mild stimulant, 
and ingests a considerable amount of water into the system ; 
it heats the body in winter, and cools the body in summer. 
Children should never be allowed to drink tea, and it had 
better be avoided by the young, while it may be indulged in 
by the aged, as it proves a valuable stimulant as the func- 
tional activities of the stomach become weakened. 

Freshly boiled water should be used for making tea. 
Boiled, because below the boiling-point the stimulating prop- 
erty, theine, would not be extracted. Freshly boiled, because 
long cooking renders it fiat and insipid to taste on account 
of escape of its atmospheric gases. Tea should always be 
infused, never boiled. Long steeping destroys the delicate 
flavor by developing a larger amount of tannic acid. 



34 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

How to Make Tea 
3 teaspoons tea 2 caps boiling water 

Scald an earthern or china teapot. 

Fat in tea, and pour on boiling water. Let stand on 
back of range or in a warm place five minutes. Strain 
and serve immediately, with or without sugar and milk. 
Avoid second steeping of leaves with addition of a few 
fresh ones. If this is done, so large an amount of tannin is 
extracted that various ills are apt to follow. 

Five o'clock Tea 

When tea is made in dining or drawing room, a " Five 
o'Clock Tea-kettle" (Samovar), and tea-ball or teapot are 
used. 

Russian Tea 

Follow recipe for making tea. Russian Tea may be 
served hot or cold, but always without milk. A thin slice 
of lemon, from which seeds have been removed, or a few 
drops of lemon-juice, is allowed for each cup. Sugar is 
added according to taste. In Russia a preserved straw- 
berry to each cup is considered an improvement. We 
imitate our Russian friends by garnishing with a candied 
cherry. 

De John's Tea 

Follow recipe for making tea and serve hot, allowing 
three whole cloves to each cup. Sugar is added according 
to taste. 

Iced Tea 
4 teaspoons tea 2 caps boiling water 

Follow recipe for making tea. Strain into glasses one- 
third full of cracked ice. Sweeten to taste, and allow one 
slice lemon to each glass tea. The flavor is much finer by 
chilling the infusion quickly. 

Wellesley Tea 

Make same as Iced Tea, having three crushed mint leaves 
in each glass into which the hot infusion is strained.

COFFEE 85 



COFFEE 



The coffee-tree is native to Abyssinia, bat is now grown 
in all tropical countries. It belongs to the genus Coffea, 
of which there are about twenty-two species. The seeds 
of berries of coffee-trees constitute the coffee of commerce. 
Each berry contains two seeds, with exception of maleberry, 
which is a single round seed. In their natural state they are 
almost tasteless ; therefore color, shape, and size determine 
value. Formerly, coffee was cured by exposure to the sun ; 
but on account of warm climate and sudden rainfalls, coffee 
was often injured. By the new method coffee is washed, 
and then dried by steam heat. 

In coffee plantations, trees are planted in parallel rows, 
from six to eight feet apart, and are pruned so as never to 
exceed six feet in height. Banana-trees are often grown in 
coffee plantations, advantage being taken of their outspread- 
ing leaves, which protect coffee- trees from direct rays of the 
sun. Brazil produces about two- thirds the coffee used. 
Central America, Java, and Arabia are also coffee centres. 

Tea comes to us ready for use; coffee needs roasting. 
In process of roasting the seeds increase in size, but lose 
fifteen per cent in weight. Boasting is necessary to develop 
the delightful aroma and flavor. Java coffee is considered 
finest Mocha commands a higher price, owing to certain 
acidity and sparkle, which alone is not desirable; but when 
combined with Java, in proportion of two parts Java to one 
part Mocha, the coffee best suited to average taste is made. 
Some people prefer Maleberry Java ; so especial care is 
taken to have maleberries separated, that they may be sold 
for higher price. Old Government Java has deservedly 
gained a good reputation, as it is carefully inspected, and its 
sale controlled by Dutch government. Strange as it may 
seem to the consumer, all coffee sold as Java does not come 
from the island of Java. Any coffee, wherever grown, hav- 
ing same characteristics and flavor, is sold as Java. The 
same is true of other kinds of coffee. 

The stimulating property of coffee is due to the alkaloid 
caffeine, together with an essential oil. Like tea, it contains 



36 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

* 

an astringent. Coffee is more stimulating than tea, although, 
weight for weight, tea contains about twice as much tlieine 
as coffee contains caffeine. The smaller proportion of tea 
used accounts for the difference. A cup of coffee with 
breakfast, and a cup of tea with supper, serve as a mild 
stimulant for an adult, and form a valuable food adjunct, 
but should never be found in the dietary of a child or dys- 
peptic. Coffee taken in moderation quickens action of the 
heart, acts directly upon the nervous system, and assists 
gastric digestion. Fatigue of body and mind are much les- 
sened by moderate use of coffee ; severe exposure to cold can 
be better endured by the coffee drinker. In times of war, 
coffee has proved more valuable than alcoholic stimulants to 
keep up the enduring power of soldiers. Coffee acts as an 
antidote for opium and alcoholic poisoning. Tea and coffee 
are much more readily absorbed when taken on an empty 
stomach ; therefore this should be avoided except when used 
for medicinal purposes. Coffee must be taken in modera- 
tion; its excessive use means palpitation of the heart, tremor, 
insomnia, and nervous prostration. 

Coffee is often adulterated with chiccory, beans, peas, and 
various cereals, which are colored, roasted, and ground. 
By many, a small amount of chiccory is considered an im- 
provement, owing to the bitter principle and volatile oil 
which it contains. Chiccory is void of caffeine. The addi- 
tion of chiccory may be detected by adding cold water to 
supposed coffee; if chiccory is present, the liquid will be 
quickly discolored, and chiccory will sink; pure coffee will 
float. 

Buying of Coffee. Coffee should be bought for family use 
in small quantities, freshly roasted and ground ; or, if one 
has a coffee mill, it may be ground at home as needed. 
After being ground, unless kept air tight, it quickly deterio- 
rates. If not bought in air-tight cans, with tight-fitting 
cover, or glass jar, it should be emptied into canister as 
soon as brought from grocer's. 

Coffee may be served as filtered coffee, infusion of coffee, 
or decoction of coffee. Commonly speaking, boiled coffee is 



COFFEE 37 

preferred, and is more economical for the consumer. Coffee 
is ground fine, coarse, and medium; and the grinding de- 
pends on the way in which it is to be made. For filtered 
coffee have it finely ground ; for boiled, coarse or medium. 

Filtered Coffee 

(French or Percolated) 

1 cup coffee (finely ground) 6 cups boiling water 

Various kinds of coffee-pots are on the market for making 
filtered coffee. They all contain a strainer to hold coffee 
without allowing grounds to mix with infusion. Some have 
additional vessel to hold boiling water, upon which coffee pot 
may rest. 

Place coffee in strainer, strainer in coffee-pot, and pot 
on the range. Add gradually boiling water, and allow it 
to filter. Cover between additions of water. If desired 
stronger, re-filter. Serve at once with cut sugar and cream. 

Put sugar and cream in cup before hot coffee. There will 
be perceptible difference if cream is added last. If cream is 
not obtainable, scalded milk may be substituted, or part 
milk and part cream may be used, if a diluted cup of coffee 
is desired. 

Boiled Coffee 

1 cup coffee 1 cup cold water 

1 egg 6 eups boiling water 

Scald granite-ware coffee-pot. Wash egg, break, and beat 
slightly. Dilute with one-half the cold water, add crushed 
shell, and mix with coffee. Turn into coffee-pot, pour on 
boiling water, and stir thoroughly. Place on front of range, 
and boil three minutes. If not boiled, coffee is cloudy ; if 
boiled too long, too much tannic acid is developed. The 
spout of pot should be covered or stuffed with soft paper to 
preveut escape of fragrant aroma. Stir and pour some in a 
cup to be sure that spout is free from grounds. Return to 
coffee pot and repeat. Add remaining cold water, which 
perfects clearing. Cold water being heavier than hot water 
sinks to the bottom, carrying grounds with it Place on 



38 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

back of range for ten minutes, where coffee will not boil 
Serve at once. If any is left over, drain from grounds, and 
reserve for making of jelly or other dessert. 

Egg-shells may be saved and used for clearing coffee. 
Three egg-shells are sufficient to effect clearing where one 
cup of ground coffee is used. The shell performs no office 
in clearing except for the albumen which clings to it. Bur- 
nett's Crystal Coffee Settler, or salt fish-skin, washed, dried, 
and cut in inch pieces, is used for same purpose. 

Coffee made with an egg has a rich flavor which egg alone 
can give. Where strict economy is necessary, if great care 
is taken, egg may be omitted. Coffee so made should be 
served from range, as much motion causes it to become 
roiled. 

Tin is an undesirable material for a coffee-pot, as tannic 
acid acts on such metal and is apt to form a poisonous 
compound. 

When coffee and scalded milk are served in equal propor- 
tions, it is called Cafe au laiL Coffee served with whipped 
cream is called Vienna Coffee. 

To Make a Small Pot of Coffee. Mix one cup ground 
coffee with one egg, slightly beaten, and crushed shell. To 
one-third of this amount add one-third cup cold water. 
Turn into a scalded coffee-pot, add one pint boiling water, 
and boil three minutes. Let stand on back of range ten 
minutes; serve. Keep remaining coffee and egg closely 
covered, in a cool place, to use two successive mornings. 

To Make Coffee for One. Allow two tablespoons ground 
coffee to one cup cold water. Add coffee to cold water, 
cover closely, and let stand over night. In the morning 
bring to a boiling-point. If carefully poured, a clear cup of 
coffee may be served. 

After-Dinner Coffee 

(Black Coffee, or Cafe* Noir) 

For after-dinner coffee use twice the quantity of coffee, 
or half the amount of liquid, given in previous recipes. Fil- 
tered coffee is often preferred where milk or cream is not 



£OCOA and chocolate 39 

used, as is always the case with black coffee. Serve in after- 
dinner coffee cups, with or without cat sugar. 

Coffee retards gastric digestion; but where the stomach 
has been overtaxed by a hearty meal, cafe noir may prove 
beneficial", so great are its stimulating effects. 

KOLA 

The preparations on the market made from the kola-nut 
have much the same effect upon the system as coffee and 
chocolate, inasmuch as they contain caffeine and theobro- 
mine ; they are also valuable for their diastase and a milk* 
digesting ferment. 

COCOA AND CHOCOLATE 

The cacao-tree (Theobroma cacao) is native to Mexico. 
Although successfully cultivated between the twentieth par- 
allels of latitude, its industry is chiefly confined to Mexico, 
South America, and the West Indies. Cocoa and chocolate 
are both prepared from seeds of the cocoa bean. The 
bean pod is from seven to ten inches long, and three to four 
and one-half inches in diameter. Each pod contains from 
twenty to forty seeds, imbedded in mucilaginous material. 
Cocoa beans are dried previous to importation. Like coffee, 
they need roasting to develop flavor. After roasting, outer 
covering of bean is removed; this covering makes what is 
known as cocoa shells, which have little nutritive value. 
The beans are broken and sold as cocoa nibs. 

The various preparations of cocoa on the market are made 
from the ground cocoa nibs, from which, by means of hy- 
draulic pressure, a large amount of fat is expressed, leaving 
a solid cake. This in turn is pulverized and mixed with 
sugar, and frequently a small amount of corn-starch or arrow- 
root. To some preparations cinnamon or vanilla is added. 
Broma contains both arrowroot and cinnamon. 

Chocolate is made from cocoa nibs, but contains a much 
larger proportion of fat than cocoa preparations. Bitter, 
sweet, or flavored chocolate is always sold in cakes. 



40 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

The fat obtained from cocoa bean is cocoa butter, which 
gives cocoa its principal nutrient. 

Cocoa and chocolate differ from tea and coffee inasmuch 
as they contain nutriment as well as stimulant. Tlieobro- 
mine, the active principle, is almost identical with theine 
and caffeine in its composition and effects. 

Many people who abstain from the use of tea and coffee 
find cocoa indispensable. Not only is it valuable for its own 
nutriment, but for the large amount of milk added to it. 
Cocoa may be well placed in the dietary of a child after his 
third year, while chocolate should be avoided as a beverage, 
but may be given as a confection. Invalids and those of 
weak digestion can take cocoa where chocolate would prove 
too rich. 

Cocoa Shells 

1 cup cocoa shells 6 cups boiling water 

Boil shells and water three hours; as water boils away 
it will be necessary to add more. Strain, and serve with 
milk and sugar. By adding one-third cup cocoa nibs, a 
much more satisfactory drink is obtained. 

Cracked Cocoa 

% cup cracked cocoa 3 pints boiling water 

Boil cracked cocoa and water two hours. Strain, and 
serve with milk and sugar. If cocoa is pounded in a mortar 
and soaked over night in three pints water, it will require 
but one hour's boiling.

CHAPTER IV 
BREAD AND BREAD MAEING 

BREAD is the most important article of food, and history 
tells of its use thousands of years before the Christian 
era. Many processes have been employed in making and 
baking ; and as a result, from the first flat cake has come 
the perfect loaf. The study of bread making is of no slight 
importance, and deserves more attention than it receives. 

Considering its great value, it seems unnecessary and 
wrong to find poor bread on the table; and would that 
our standard might be raised as high as that of our friends 
across the water! Who does not appreciate the loaf pro- 
duced by the French baker, who has worked months to 
learn the art of bread making? 

Bread is made from flour of wheat, or other cereals, by 
addition of water, salt, and a ferment. Wheat flour is best 
adapted for bread making, as it contains gluten in the right 
proportion to make the spongy loaf. But for its slight de- 
ficiency in fat, wheat bread is a perfect food ; hence arose 
the custom of spreading it with butter. It should be remem- 
bered, in speaking of wheat bread as perfect food, that it 
must be made of flour rich in gluten. Next to wheat flour 
ranks rye in importance for bread making ; but it is best 
used in combination with wheat, for alone it makes heavy, 
sticky, moist bread. Corn also needs to be used in com- 
bination with wheat for bread making, for if used alone the 
bread will be crumbly. 

The miller, in order to produce flour which will make the 
white loaf (so sightly to many), in the process of grinding 
wheat has been forced to remove the inner bran coats, so 
rich in mineral matter, and much of the gluten intimately 
connected with them. 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 47 

To understand better the details of bread making, wheat, 
from which bread is principally made, should be considered. 

A grain of wheat consists of (1) an outer covering or 
husk, which is always removed before milling; (2) bran 
coats, which contain mineral matter ; (3) gluten, the proteid 
matter and fat; and (4) starch, the centre and largest part 
of the grain. Wheat is distinguished as white and soft, or 
red and hard. The former is known as winter wheat, having 
been sown in the fall, and living through the winter; the 
latter is known as spring wheat, having been sown in the 
spring. From winter wheat, pastry flour, sometimes called 
St. Louis, is made; from spring wheat, bread flour, also 
called Haxall. St. Louis flour takes its name from the old 
process of grinding ; Haxall, from the name of the inventor 
of the new process. All flours are now milled by the same 
process. For difference in composition of wheat flours, con- 
sult table in Chapter VI on Cereals. 

Wheat is milled for converting into flour by processes 
producing essentially the same results, all requiring cleans- 
ing, grinding, and bolting. Entire wheat flour has only the 
outer husk removed, the remainder of the kernel being finely 
ground. Graham flour, confounded with entire wheat, is 
too often found to be an inferior flour, mixed with coarse 
bran. 

Grinding is accomplished by one of four systems : (1) low 
milling ; (2) Hungarian system, or high milling ; (3) roller 
milling ; and (4) by a machine known as distintegrator. 

In low milling process, grooved stones are employed for 
grinding. The stones are enclosed in a metal case, and pro- 
vision is made within case for passage of air to prevent 
wheat from becoming overheated. The lower stone being 
permanently fixed, the upper stone being so balanced above 
it that grooves may exactly correspond, when upper stone 
rotates, sharp edges of grooves meet each other, and operate 
like a pair of scissors. By this process flour is made ready 
for bolting by one grinding. 

In high milling process, grooved stones are employed, but 
are kept so far apart that at first the wheat is only bruised, 
and a series of grindings and siftings is necessary. This 



48 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

process is applicable only to the hardest wheats, and is par- 
tially supplanted by roller-milling. 

In roller-milling, wheat is subjected to action of a pair of 
steel or chilled-iron horizontal rollers, having toothed sur- 
faces. They revolve in opposite directions, at different rates 
of speed, and have a cutting action. 

Porcelain rollers, with rough surfaces, are sometimes em- 
ployed. In this system, grinding is accomplished by cutting 
rather than crushing. 

"The disintegrator consists of a pair of circular metal 
disks, set face to face, studded with circles of projecting 
bars so arranged that circles of bars on one disk alternate 
with those of the other. The disks are mounted on the same 
centre, and so closely set to one another that projecting bars 
of one disk come quite close to plane surface of the other. 
They are inclosed within an external casing. The disks 
are caused to rotate in opposite directions with great rapid- 
ity, and the grain is almost instantaneously reduced to a 
powder." 

After grinding comes bolting, by which process the differ- 
ent grades of flour are obtained. The ground wheat is 
placed in octagonal cylinders (covered with silk or linen 
bolting-cloth of different degrees of fineness), which are 
allowed to rotate, thus forcing the wheat through. The 
flour from first siftings contains the largest percentage of 
gluten. 

Flour is branded under different names to suit manufac- 
turer or dealer. In consequence, the same wheat, milled by 
the same process, makes flour which is sold under different 
names. 

In buying flour, whether bread or pastry, select the best 
kept by your grocer. Some of the well-known brands on 
bread flour are King Arthur, Swan's Down, Bridal Veil, 
Columbia, Washburn's Extra, and Pillbury's Best ; of pastry, 
Best St. Louis. Bread flour should be used in ail cases 
where yeast is called for, with few exceptions; in other 
cases, pastry flour. The difference between bread and pas- 
try flour may be readily determined. Take bread flour in 
the hand, close hand tightly, then open, and flour will not 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 49 

keep in shape ; if allowed to pass through fingers it will feel 
slightly granular. Take pastry flour in the hand, close hand 
tightly, open, and flour will be in shape, having impression 
of the lines of the hand, and feeling soft and velvety to 
touch. Flour should always be sifted before measuring. 

Entire wheat flour differs from ordinary flour inasmuch 
as it contains all the gluten found in wheat, the outer husk 
of kernels only being removed, the remainder ground to 
different degrees of fineness and left unbolted. Such flours 
are sold by the different health-food companies, who have 
agencies in the large cities. Franklin Mills, Old Grist Mill, 
and Health Food flours are included in this class. 

Gluten, the proteid of wheat, is a gray, tough, elastic sub- 
stance, insoluble in water. On account of its great power 
of expansion, it holds the gas developed in bread dough by 
fermentation, which otherwise would escape. 

Teaot 

Yeast is a microscopic plant of fungous growth, and is the 
lowest form of vegetable life. It consists of spores, or 
germs, found floating in air, and belongs to a family of 
which there are many species. These spores grow by bud- 
ding and division, and multiply very rapidly under favorable 
conditions, and produce fermentation. 

Fermentation is the process by which, under influence of 
air, warmth, moisture, and some ferment, sugar (or dex- 
trose, starch converted into sugar) is changed into alcohol 
(C 2 H 6 HO) and carbon dioxide (C0 2 ). The product of all 
fermentation is the same. Three kinds are considered, — 
alcoholic, acetic, and lactic. Where bread dough is allowed 
to ferment by addition of yeast, the fermentation is cUco7u>Uc ; 
where alcoholic fermentation continues too long, acetic fer- 
mentation sets in, which is a continuation of alcoholic. 
Lactic fermentation is fermentation which takes place when 
milk sours. * 

Liquid, dry, or compressed yeast may be used for rais- 
ing bread. The compressed yeast cakes done up in tinfoil 
have long proved satisfactory, and are now almost uni- 
versally used, having replaced the home-made liquid yeast 



50 BOSTON COOKTNG-SOHOOL COOK BOOK 

Never use a yeast cake unless perfectly fresh, which 
may be determined by its light color and absence of dark 
streaks. 

The yeast plant is killed at 212° F. ; life is suspended, but 
not entirely destroyed, 32° F. The temperature best suited 
for its growth is from 65° to 68° F. The most favorable 
conditions for the growth of yeast are a warm, moist, sweet, 
nitrogenous soil. These must be especially considered in 
bread making. 

Bread Making 

Fermented bread is made by mixing to a dough, flour, 
with a definite quantity of water, milk, or water and milk, 
salt, and a ferment. Sugar is usually added to hasten fer- 
mentation. Dough is then kneaded that the ingredients may 
be thoroughly incorporated, covered, and allowed to rise in 
a temperature of 68° F., until dough has doubled its bulk. 
This change has been caused by action of the ferment, which 
attacks some of the starch in flour, and changes it to sugar, 
and sugar in turn to alcohol and carbon dioxide, thus light- 
ening the whole mass. Dough is then kneaded a second 
time to break bubbles and distribute evenly the carbon 
dioxide. It is shaped in loaves, put in greased bread pans 
(they being half filled), covered, allowed to rise in tempera- 
ture same as for first rising, to double its bulk. If risen too 
long, it will be full of large holes ; if not risen long enough, 
it will be heavy and soggy. If pans containing loaves are 
put in too hot a place while rising, a heavy streak will be 
found near bottom of loaf. 

How to Shape Loaves and Biscuits. To shape bread 
dough in loaves, divide dough in parts, each part large 
enough for a loaf, knead uutil smooth, and if possible avoid 
seams in under part of loaf. If baked in brick pan, place 
two loaves in one pan, brushed between with a little melted 
butter. If baked in long shallow pan, when well kneaded, 
roll with both hands to lengthen, care being taken that it is 
smooth and of uniform thickness. Where long loaves are 
baked on sheets, shape and roll loosely in a towel sprinkled 
with corn meal for last rising. 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 51 

To shape bread dough in biscuits, pull or cut off as many 
small pieces (having them of uniform size) as there are to be 
biscuits. Flour palms of hands slightly ; take up each piece 
and shape separately, lifting, with thumb and first two 
fingers of right hand, and placing in palm of left hand, con- 
stantly moving dough round and round, while folding to- 
wards the centre ; when smooth, turn it over and roll between 
palms of hands. Place in greased pans near together, 
brushed between with a little melted butter, which will cause 
biscuits to separate easily after baking. For finger rolls, 
shape biscuits and roll with one hand on part of board where 
there is no flour, until of desired length, care being taken to 
make smooth, of uniform size, and round at ends. 

Biscuits may be shaped in a great variety of ways, but 
they should always be small. Large biscuits, though equally 
good, never tempt one by their daintiness. 

Bread is often brushed over with milk before baking, to 
make a darker crust. 

Where bread is allowed to rise over night, a small piece 
of yeast cake must be used ; one-fourth yeast cake to one 
pint liquid is sufficient, one-third yeast cake to one quart 
liquid. Bread mixed and baked during the day requires 
a larger quantity of yeast; one yeast cake, or sometimes 
even more, to one pint of liquid. Bread dough mixed with 
a large quantity of yeast should be watched during rising, 
and cut down as soon as mixture doubles its bulk. If proper 
care is taken, the bread will be found most satisfactory, 
having neither " yeasty " nor sour taste. 

Fermented bread was formerly raised by means of leaven. 

Baking of Bread 

Bread is baked : (1) To kill ferment, (2) to make soluble 
the starch, (3) to drive off alcohol and carbon dioxide, and 
(4) to form brown crust of pleasant flavor. Bread should 
be baked in a hot oven. If the oven be too hot the crust 
will brown quickly before the heat has reached the centre, 
and prevent further rising ; loaf should continue rising for 
first fifteen minutes of baking, when it should begin to brown, 



52 BOSTON COOKING-80HOOL COOK BOOK 

and continue browning for the next twenty minutes. The 
last fifteen minutes it should finish baking, when the heat 
may be reduced. When bread is done, it will not cling to 
sides of pan, and may be easily removed. Biscuits require 
more heat than loaf bread, should continue rising the first 
five minutes, and begin to brown in eight minutes. Experi- 
ence is the best guide for testing temperature of oven. Vari- 
ous oven thermometers have been made, but none have 
proved practical. Bread may be brushed over with melted 
butter, three minutes before removal from oven, if a more 
tender crust is desired. 

Care of Bread after Baking 

Remove loaves at once from pans, and place side down 
on a wire bread or cake cooler. If a crisp crust is desired, 
allow bread to cool without covering; if soft crust, cover 
with a towel during cooling. When cool, put in tin box or 
stone jar, and cover closely. 

Never keep bread wrapped in cloth, as the cloth will ab- 
sorb moisture and transmit an unpleasant taste to bread. 
Bread tins or jars should be washed and scalded twice a 
week in winter, and every other day in summer; otherwise 
bread is apt to mould. As there are so many ways of using 
small and stale pieces of bread, care should be taken that 
none is wasted. 

Unfermented bread is raised without a ferment, the car- 
bon dioxide being produced by the use of soda (alkaline salt) 
and an acid. Soda, employed in combination with cream 
of tartar, for raising mixtures, in proportion of one-third 
soda to two- thirds cream of tartar, was formerly used to a 
great extent, but has been generally superseded by baking 
powder. 

Soda bicarbonate (NaHC0 3 ) is manufactured from sodium 
chloride (NaCl), common salt or cryolite. 

Baking powder is composed of soda and cream of tartar 
in definite, correct proportions, mixed with small quantity 
of dry material (flour or cornstarch) to keep action from 
taking place. If found to contain alum or ammonia, it is 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 53 

impure. In using baking powder, allow two teaspoons 
baking powder to each cup of flour, when eggs are not used ; 
to egg mixtures allow one and one-half teaspoons baking 
powder. When a recipe calls for soda and cream of tartar, 
in substituting baking powder use double amount of cream 
of tartar given. 

These rules apply to the various soda and cream of 
tartar baking powders on the market. Horsford's Baking 
Powder, the only mineral one, requires one-third less than 
others. 

Soda and cream of tartar, or baking powder mixtures, are 
made light by liberation of gas in mixture ; the gas in soda 
is set free by the acid in cream of tartar ; in order to accom- 
plish this, moisture and heat are both required. As soon as 
moisture is added to baking powder mixtures, the gas will 
begin to escape ; whence the necessity of baking as soon as 
possible. If baking powder only is used for raising, put 
mixture to be cooked in a hot oven. 

Cream of tartar (HKC 4 (i H 4 ) is obtained from argols 
found adhering to bottom and sides of wine casks, which 
are ninety per cent cream of tartar. The argols are ground 
and dissolved in boiling water, coloring matter removed 
by filtering through animal charcoal, and by a process of 
recry8tallization the cream of tartar of commerce is obtained. 

The acid found in molasses, sour milk, and lemon juice 
will liberate gas in soda, but the action is much quicker than 
when cream of tartar is used. 

Fermented and unfermented breads are raised to be made 
light and porous, that they may be easily acted upon by the 
digestive ferments. Some mixtures are made light by beat- 
ing sufficiently to enclose a large amount of air, and when 
baked in a hot oven air is forced to expand. 

Aerated bread is made light by carbon dioxide forced 
into dough under pressure. The carbon dioxide is generated 
from sulphuric acid and lime. Aerated bread is of close 
texture, and has a flavor peculiar to itself. It is a product 
of the baker's skill, but has found little favor except in few 
localities.

Water Bread 

2 cups boiling water 1% teaspoons salt 

1 tablespoon butter % yeast cake dissolved in 

1 tablespoon lard % cup lukewarm water 

1 tablespoon sugar 6 cups sifted flour 

Put butter, lard, sugar, and salt in bread raiser, or large 
bowl without a lip ; pour on boiling water ; when lukewarm, 
add dissolved yeast cake and live cups of flour; then stir 
until thoroughly mixed, using a knife or mixing-spoon. 
Add remaining flour, mix, and turn on a floured board, leav- 
ing a clean bowl ; knead until mixture is smooth, elastic to 
touch, and bubbles may be seen under the surface. Some 
practice is required to knead quickly, but the motion once 
acquired will never be forgotten. Return to bowl, cover 
with a clean cloth kept for the purpose, and board or tin 
cover; let rise over night in temperature of 65° F. In 
morning cut down : this is accomplished by cutting through 
and turning over dough several times with a case knife, and 
checks fermentation for a short time ; dough may be again 
raised, and recut down if it is not convenient to shape into 
loaves or biscuits after firBt cutting. When properly cared 
for, bread need never sour. Toss on board slightly floured, 
knead, shape into loaves or biscuits, place in greased pans, 
having pans nearly half full. Cover, let rise again to double 
its bulk, and bake in hot oven. (See Baking of Bread and 
Time-Table for Baking.) This recipe will make a doable 
loaf of bread and pan of biscuit. Cottolene, coto suet, or 
beef drippings may be used for shortening, one-third less 
being required. Bread shortened with butter has a good 
flavor, but is not as white as when lard is used.

mixed, raised, and baked in five hours, by using one yeast 
cake. Bread made in this way has proved most satisfac- 
tory. It is usually mixed in the morning, and the cook is 
able to watch the dough while rising and keep it at uni- 
form temperature. It is often desirable to place bowl con- 
taining dough in pan of water, keeping water at uniform 
temperature of from 95° to 100° F. Cooks who have not 
proved themselves satisfactory bread makers are successful 
when employing this method. 

Entire Wheat Bread 

2 cops scalded milk 1 tetspoqn salt

Add sweetening and salt to milk; cool, and when luke- 
warm add dissolved yeast cake and flour; beat well, cover, 
and let rise to double its bulk. Again beat, and turn into 
greased bread pans, having pans one-half full ; let rise, and 
bake. Entire Wheat Bread should not quite double its bulk 
during last rising. This mixture may be baked in gem pans. 

German Caraway Bread 

Follow recipe for Milk and Water Bread (see p. 54), 
using rye flour in place of entire wheat flour, and one table-

again, and bake in a loaf. 

Entire Wheat and White Floor Bread 

Use same ingredients as for Entire Wheat Bread, with 
exception of flour. For flour use three and one-fourth cups 
entire wheat and two and three-fourths cups white flour. 
The dough should be slightly kneaded, and if handled 
quickly will not stick to board. Loaves and biscuits should 
be shaped with hands instead of pouring into pans, as in 
Entire Wheat Bread.

Add boiling water to oats and let stand one hour; add 
molasses, salt, butter, dissolved yeast cake, and flour; let 
rise, beat thoroughly, turn into buttered bread pans, let rise 
again, and bake. By using one-half cup less flour, the 
dough is better suited for biscuits, but, being soft, is diffi- 
cult to handle. To make shaping of biscuits easy, take up 
mixture by spoonfuls, drop into plate of flour, and have 
palms of hands well covered with flour before attempting to 
shape.

oughly, cover, and let rise until light Add rye meal until 
dough is stiff enough to knead ; knead thoroughly, let rise, 
shape in loaves, let rise again, and bake. 

Date Bread 

Use recipe for Health Food Muffins (see p. 67). After 
the first rising, while kneading, add two-thirds cup each of 
English walnut meats cut in small pieces, and dates stoned 
and cut in pieces. Shape in a loaf, let rise in pan, and bake 
fifty minutes in a moderate oven. This bread is well 
adapted for sandwiches. 

Boston Brown Bread 

1 cup rye meal \ tablespoon soda 

1 cup granulated corn meal 1 teaspoon salt 

1 cup Graham flour % cup molasses 

2 cups sour milk, or \\ cups sweet milk or water 

Mix and sift dry ingredients, add molasses and milk, stir 
until well mixed, turn into a well-buttered mould, and steam 
three and one-half hours. The cover should be buttered 
before being placed on mould, and then tied down with 
string ; otherwise the bread in rising might force off cover. 
Mould should never be filled more than two-thirds full. A 
melon-mould or one-pound baking-powder boxes make the 
most attractive-shaped loaves, but a five-pound lard pail 
answers the purpose. For steaming, place mould on a trivet 
in kettle containing boiling water, allowing water to come 
half-way up around mould, cover closely, and steam, adding, 

needed, more boiling water.

color a golden brown on each side. Toast, if piled compactly 
and allowed to stand, will soon become moist. Toast may 
be battered at table or before sending to table.

allowing one-half teaspoon salt to one cap boiling water. 
Spread slices with batter, and serve at once.

brown other side. Serve for breakfast or luncheon, or with 
a sauce for dessert. 

Brewis 

Break stale bits or slices of brown and white bread in 
small pieces, allowing one and one-half cups brown bread to 
one-half cup white bread. Butter a hot frying-pan, put in 
bread, and cover with equal parts milk and water. Cook 
until soft ; add butter and salt to taste. 

Bread for Garnishing 

Dry toast is often used for garnishing, cut in various 
shapes. Always shape before toasting. Cubes of bread, 
toast points, and small oblong pieces are most common. 
Cubes of stale bread, from which centres are removed, are 
fried in deep fat and called crofistades; half -inch cubes, 
browned in butter, or fried in deep fat, are called croutons. 

Uses for Stale Bread 

All pieces of bread should be saved and utilized. Large 
pieces are best for toast. Soft stale bread, from which 
crust is removed, when crumbed, is called stale bread crumbs, 
or raspings, and is used for puddings, griddle- cakes, omelets, 
scalloped dishes, and dipping food to be fried. Remnants 
of bread, from which crusts have not been removed, are 
dried in oven, rolled, and sifted. These are called dry bread 
crumbs, and are useful for crumbing croquettes, cutlets, 
fish, meat, etc.

BISCUITS, BREAKFAST CAKES, AND SHORTCAKES 

Batters, Sponges, and Doughs 

BATTER is a mixture of flour and some liquid (usually 
combined with other ingredients, as sugar, salt, eggs, 
etc.), of consistency to pour easily, or to drop from a spoon. 
Batters are termed thin or thick, according to their 
consistency. 

Sponge is a batter to which yeast is added. 
Dough differs from batter inasmuch as it is stiff enough to 
be handled.

J4 cup cream 

Mix and sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, and 
salt Rub in butter with tips of fingers; add eggs well 
beaten, and cream. Toss on a floured board, pat, and roll to 
three-fourths inch in thickness. Cut in squares, brush with 
white of egg, sprinkle with sugar, and bake in a hot oven 
fifteen minutes.

to differences in flour. Toss on a floured board, pat and 
roil lightly to one-half inch in thickness. Shape with a bis- 
cuit-cutter. Place on buttered pan, and bake in hot oven 
twelve to fifteen minutes. If baked in too slow an oven, the 
gas will escape before it has done its work. Many obtain 
better results by using bread flour.

CHAPTER VI 



CEREALS 

CEREALS (cultivated grasses) rank first among vege- 
table foods; being of hardy growth and easy culti- 
vation, they are more widely diffused over the globe than 
any of the flowering plants. They include wheat, oats, 
rye, barley, maize (Indian corn), and rice ; some authori- 
ties place buckwheat among them. Wheat probably is the 
roost largely consumed ; next to wheat, comes rice.

Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. 

Macaroni, spaghetti, and vermicelli are made from wheaten 
flour, rich in gluten, moistened to a stiff dough with water, 
and forced through small apertures in an iron plate by 
means of a screw press. Various Italian pastes are made 
from the same mixture. Macaroni is manufactured to 
some extent in this country, but the best comes from Italy, 
Lagana and Pejero, being the favorite brand. When maca- 
roni is colored, it is done by the use of saffron, not by eggs, 
as is generally supposed. The only egg macaroni is manu- 
factured in strips, and comes from Minneapolis. 



86 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Macaroni is valuable food, as it is very cheap and nutri- 
tious; but being deficient in fat, it should be combined 
with cream, butter, or cheese, to make a perfect food. 

From cereals many preparations are made, used alone, 
or in combination with other food products. From rice 
is made rice flour; from oats, oatmeal, and oats steam- 
cooked and rolled, — as Rolled A vena, Quaker Rolled Oats, 
H-O, etc. There are many species of corn, the principal 
varieties being white, yellow, and red. From corn is made 
corn meal, — both white and yellow, — cornstarch, hominy, 
maizena, cerealine, samp, and hulled corn; from wheat, 
wheaten or white flour, Wheatena, Wheatlet, Rolled Wheat, 
Petti John's, etc. Rye is used for Rye Flakes, meal, and flour; 
barley, for flour and pearl barley. Buckwheat, throughout 
the United States, is used only when made into flour for 
buckwheat cakes. 

For family use, cereals should be bought in small quanti- 
ties, and kept in glass jars, tightly covered. Many cereal 
preparations are on the market for making breakfast mushes, 
put up in one and two pound packages, with directions for 
cooking. In nearly all cases, time allowed for cooking is 
not sufficient, unless dish containing cereal is brought in 
direct contact with fire, which is not the best way. Mushes 
should be cooked over hot water after the first five minutes ; 
if a double boiler is not procurable, improvise one. Boiling 
water and salt should always be added to cereals, allowing 
one teaspoon salt to each cup of cereal, — boiled to soften 
cellulose and swell starch grains, salted to give flavor. 
Indian meal and finely ground preparations should be 
mixed with cold water before adding boiling water, to 
prevent lumping.

Core apples, leaving large cavities; pare, and cook until 
soft in syrup made by boiling sugar and water together, 
allowing one cup sugar to one and one-half cups water. 
Fill cavities with oatmeal mush ; serve with sugar and 
cream. The syrup should be saved and re-used. Berries, 
sliced bananas, or sliced peaches, are acceptably served with 
any breakfast cereal.

cream. To serve for breakfast, or as a simple dessert. 

Fried Mushes 

Mush left over from breakfast may be packed in greased, 
one pound baking-powder box, and covered, which will pre- 
vent crust from forming. The next morning remove from 
box, slice thinly, dip in flour, and saute. Serve with maple

French Chef 

Pick over rice; add slowly to boiling, salted water, 
so as not to check boiling of water. Boil thirty minutes, 
or until soft, which may be determined by testing ker- 
nels. Old rice absorbs much more water than new rice, 
and takes longer for cooking. Drain in coarse strainer, 
and pour over one quart hot water ; return to kettle 
in which it was cooked; cover, place on back of range, 
and let stand to dry off, when kernels are distinct. 
When stirring rice, always use a fork to avoid breaking 
kernels.

five minutes, or until kernels are soft ; uncover, that steam 
may escape. When rice is steamed for a simple dessert, 
use one-half quantity of water given in recipe, and steam 
until rice has absorbed water; then add scalded milk for 
remaining liquid. 

To wash rioe. Put rice in strainer, place strainer over

CHAPTER VII 
EGOS 

COMPOSITION 

Proteid, 14.0 % Mineral matter, 1 % 

Fat, 10.6% Water, 73.5% 

EGGS, like milk, form a typical food, inasmuch as they 
contain all the elements, in the right proportion, neces- 
sary for the support of the body. Their highly concentrated, 
nutritive value renders it necessary to use them in combina- 
tion with other foods rich in starch (bread, potatoes, etc.). 
In order that the stomach may have enough to act upon, a 
certain amount of bulk must be furnished. 

A pound of eggs (nine; is equivalent in nutritive value to 
a pound of beef. From this it may be seen that eggs, at 
even twenty-five cents per dozen, should not be freely used 
by the strict economist. Eggs being rich in proteid serve as 
a valuable substitute for meat. In most families, their use 
in the making of cake, custard, puddings, etc., renders them 
almost indispensable. It is surprising how many intelligent 
women, who look well to the affairs of the kitchen, are satis- 
fied to use what are termed " cooking eggs"; this shows 
poor judgment from an economical standpoint. Strictly 
fresh eggs should always be used if obtainable. An egg 
after the first twenty -four hours steadily deteriorates. If 
exposed to air, owing to the porous structure of the shell. 
there is an evaporation of water, air rushes in, and decom- 
position takes place. 

White of egg contains albumen in its purest form. Al- 
bumen coagulates at a temperature of from 134° to 160° F. 
Herein lies the importance of cooking eggs at a low tempera- 
ture, thus rendering them easy of digestion. Eggs cooked 



EGG8 95 

in boiling water are tough and horny, difficult of digestion, 
and should never be served. 

When eggs come from the market, they should be washed, 
and put away in a cold place. 

Ways of Determining Freshness of Eggs. I. Hold in front 
of candle flame in dark room, and the centre should look 
clear. 

II. Place in basin of cold water, and they should sink. 

III. Place large end to the cheek, and a warmth should 
be felt. 

Ways of Keeping Eggs. I. Pack in sawdust, small end 

down. 

II. Keep in lime water. 

III. From July to September a large number of eggs are 
packed, small ends down, in cases having compartments, 
one for each egg, and kept in cold storage. Eggs are often 
kept in cold storage six months, and then sold as cooking 
eggs. 

Boiled Eggs 

Have ready a saucepan containing boiling water. Care- 
fully put in with a spoon the number of eggs desired, cover- 
ing them with water. Remove saucepan to back of range, 
where water will not boil. Cook from six to eight minutes 
if liked "softrboiled," forty to forty-five if liked "hard- 
boiled." Eggs may be cooked by placing in cold water and 
allowing water to heat .gradually until the boiling-point is 
reached, when they will be "soft boiled." In using hard- 
boiled eggs for making other dishes, when taken from the 
hot water they should be plunged into cold water to prevent, 
if possible, discoloration of yolks. 

Eggs perfectly cooked should be placed and kept in water 
at a uniform temperature of 175° F. 

Dropped Eggs (Poached) 

Have ready a shallow pan two-thirds full of boiling salted 
water, allowing one-half tablespoon salt to one quart of 
water. Put two or three buttered muffin rings in the water. 
Break each egg separately into a cup, and carefully slip into 
a muffin ring. The water should cover the eggs. When 



96 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

there is a film over the top, and the white is firm, carefully 
remove with a buttered skimmer to circular pieces of but- 
tered toast, and let each person season his own egg with 
butter, salt, and pepper. If cooked for an invalid, garnish 
with four toast-points and a bit of parsley. An egg-poacher 
may be used instead of muffin rings.

and salt and pepper. Line potato shells with mixture, place 
in each cavity a poached egg, cover with potato mixture, 
and bake until browned. Care must be taken to have eggs 
delicately parched.

evenly, place on range where it will cook slowly, occa- 
sionally turning the pan that omelet may brown evenly. 
When well "puffed" and delicately browned underneath, 
place pan on centre grate of oven to finish cooking the top. 
The omelet is cooked if it is firm to the touch when pressed 
by the finger. If it clings to the finger like the beaten white 
of egg, it needs longer cooking. Fold, and turn on hot plat- 
ter, and pour around one and one-half cups Thin White 
Sauce 

Milk is sometimes used in place of hot water, but hot 
water makes a more tender omelet. A few grains baking 
powder are used by 6ome cooks to hold up an omelet 



106 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

To Fold and Turn an Omelet 

Hold an omelet pan by handle with the left hand. With 
a case knife make two one- half inch incisions opposite each 
other at right angles to handle. Place knife under the part 
of omelet nearest handle, tip pan to nearly a vertical posi- 
tion ; by carefully coaxing the omelet with knife, it will 
fold and turn without breaking.

SOUPS 109 



CHAPTER VIII 
SOUPS 

IT cannot be denied that the French excel all nations in 
the excellence of their cuisine, and to their soups and 
sauces belong the greatest praise. It would be well to follow 
their example, and it is the duty of every housekeeper to 
learn the art of soup making. How may a hearty dinner be 
better begun than with a thin soup? The hot liquid, taken 
into an empty stomach, is easily assimilated, acts as a stim- 
ulant rather than a nutrient (as is the popular opinion), and 
prepares the way for the meal which is to follow. The 
cream soups and purees are so nutritious that, with bread 
and butter, they furnish a satisfactory meal. 

Soups are divided into two great classes: soups with 
stock ; soups without stock. 

Soups with stock have, for their basis, beef, veal, mutton, 
fish, poultry, or game, separately or in combination. They 
are classified as : — 

Bouillon, made from lean beef, delicately seasoned, and 
usually cleared. Exception, — clam bouillon. 

Brown Soup Stock, made from beef (two-thirds lean meat, 
and remainder bone and fat), highly seasoned with vegeta- 
bles, spices, and sweet herbs. 

White Soup Stock, made from chicken or veal, with deli- 
cate seasonings. 

Consomme, usually made from two or three kinds of meat 
(beef, veal, and fowl being employed), highly seasoned with 
vegetables, spices, and sweet herbs. Always served clear. 

Zaaxnb Stock, delicately seasoned, is served as mutton 
broth. 

Soups without stock are classified as : — 

Cream Soups, made of vegetables or fish, with milk, and a 
small amount of cream and seasonings. Always thickened. 

Purees, made from vegetables or fish, forced through 



110 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

a strainer, and retained in soup, milk, and seasonings. 
Generally thicker than cream soup. Sometimes White Stock 
is added. 

Bisques, generally made from shell-fish, milk, and sea- 
sonings, and served with fish dice ; made similarly to purees. 
They may be made of meat, game, or vegetables, with small 
dice of the same. 

Various names have been given to soups, according to 
their flavorings, chief ingredients, the people who use them, 
etc. To the Scotch belongs Scotch Broth ; to the French, 
Pot-au-feu ; to the Indo, Mulligatawny ; and to the Spanish, 
Olla Podrida. 

SOUP MAKING 

The art of soup making is more easily mastered than at 
first appears. The young housekeeper is startled at the 
amazingly large number of ingredients the recipe calls for, 
and often is discouraged. One may, with but little expense, 
keep at hand what is essential for the making of a good 
soup. Winter vegetables — turnips, carrots, celery, and 
onions — may be bought in large or small quantities. The 
outer stalks of celery, often not suitable for serving, should 
be Baved for soups. At seasons when celery is a luxury, 
the tips and roots should be saved and dried. Sweet herbs, 
including thyme, savory, and marjoram, are dried and put 
up in packages, retailing from five to ten cents. Bay leaves, 
which should be used sparingly, may be obtained at first- 
class grocers* or druggists' ; seeming never to lose strength, 
they may be kept indefinitely. Spices, including whole 
cloves, allspice berries, peppercorns, and stick cinnamon, 
should be kept on hand. These seasonings, with the addi- 
tion of salt, pepper, and parsley, are the essential flavorings 
for stock soups. Flour, cornstarch, arrowroot, fine tapioca, 
sago, pearl barley, rice, bread, or eggs are added to give 
consistency and nourishment. 

In small families, where there are few left-overs, fresh 
meat must be bought for the making of soup stock, as a 
good soup cannot be made from a small amount of poor 
material. On the other hand, large families need seldom 



80UPB 111 

buy fresh meat, provided all left-overs are properly cared 
for. The soup kettle should receive small pieces of beef 
(roasted, broiled, or stewed), veal, carcasses of fowl or 
chicken, chop bones, bones left from lamb roast, and all 
trimmings and bones, which a careful housewife should see 
are sent from the market with her order. Avoid the use of 
smoked or corned meats, or large pieces of raw mutton or 
lamb surrounded by fat, on account of the strong flavor so 
disagreeable to many. A small piece of bacon or lean ham 
is sometimes cooked with vegetables for flavor. 

Beef ranks first as regards utility and economy in soup 
making. It should be cut from the fore or hind shin (which 
cuts contain marrow-bone), the middle cuts being most de- 
sirable. If the lower part of shin is used, the soup, although 
rich in gelatin, lacks flavor, unless a cheap piece of lean meat 
is used with it, which frequently is done. It must be remem- 
bered that meat, bone, and fat in the right proportions are 
all necessary; allow two-thirds lean meat, the remaining 
one-third bone and fat From the meat the soluble juices, 
salts, extractives (which give color and flavor), and a small 
quantity of gelatin are extracted; from the bone, gelatin 
(which gives the stock when cold a jelly-like consistency) 
and mineral matter. Gelatin is also obtained from cartilage, 
skin, tendons, and ligaments. Some of the fat is absorbed ; 
the remainder rises to the top and should be removed. 

Soup-stock making is rendered easier by use of proper 
utensils. Sharp meat knives, hardwood board, two pur6e 
strainers having meshes of different size, and a soup digester 
(a porcelain-lined iron pot, having tight-fitting cover, with 
valve in the top), or covered granite kettle, are essentials. 
An iron kettle, which formerly constituted one of the fur- 
nishings of a range, may be used if perfectly smooth. A 
saw, cleaver, and scales, although not necessary, are useful, 
and lighten labor. 

When meat comes from market, remove from paper and 
put in cool place. When ready to start stock, if scales are 
at hand, weigh meat aud bone to see if correct proportions 
have been sent. Wipe meat with clean cheesecloth wrung 
oat of cold water. Cut lean meat in one-inch cubes ; by so 



112 BOSTON COOKTNG-SOHOOL COOK BOOK 

doing, a large amount of surface is exposed to the water, 
and juices are more easily drawn out. Heat frying-pan 
hissing hot; remove marrow from marrow- bone, and use 
enough to brown one-third of the lean meat, stirring con- 
stantly, that all parts of surface may be seared, thus pre- 
venting escape of juices, — sacrificing a certain amount of 
goodness in the stock to give additional color and flavor, 
which is obtained by cararaelization. Put fat, bone, and 
remaining lean meat in soup kettle ; cover with cold water, 
allowing one pint to each pound of meat, bone, and fat. 
Let stand one hour, that cold water may draw out juices 
from meat. Add browned meat, taking water from soap 
kettle to rinse out frying-pan, that none of the coloring may 
be lost. Heat gradually to boiling-point, and cook six or 
seven hours at low temperature. A scum will rise on the 
top, which contains coagulated albuminous juices ; these give 
to soup its chief nutritive value ; many, however, prefer a 
clear soup, and have them removed. If allowed to remain, 
when straining, a large part will pass through strainer. 
Vegetables, spices, and salt should be added the last hour 
of cooking. Strain and cool quickly ; by so doing, stock is 
less apt to ferment. A knuckle of veal is often used for 
making white soup stock. Fowl should be used for stock in 
preference to chicken, as it is cheaper, and contains a larger 
amount of nutriment. A cake of fat forms on stock when 
cold, which excludes air, and should not be removed until 
stock is used. To remove fat, run a knife around edge of 
bowl and carefully remove the same. A small quantity will 
remain, which should be removed by passing a cloth wrung 
out of hot water around edge and over top of stock. This 
fat should be clarified and used for drippings. If time can- 
not be allowed for stock to cool before using, take off as 
much fat as possible with a spoon, and remove the remainder 
by passing tissue or any absorbent paper over the surface. 

How to Clear Soup Stook 

Whites of eggs slightly beaten, or raw, lean beef finely 
chopped, are employed for clearing soup stock. The al- 



soups 113 

bumen foand in each effects the clearing by drawing to itself 
some of the juices which have been extracted from the meat, 
and by action of heat have been coagulated. Some rise to 
the top and form a scum, others are precipitated. 

Remove fat from stock, and put quantity to be cleared in 
stew-pan, allowing white and shell of one egg to each quart 
of stock. Beat egg slightly, break shell in small pieces and 
add to stock. Place on front of range, and stir constantly 
until boiling-Doint is reached ; boil two minutes. Set back 
where it may simmer twenty minutes ; remove scum, and 
strain through double thickness of cheesecloth placed over 
a fine strainer. If stock to be cleared is not sufficiently sea- 
soned, additional seasoning must be added as soon as stock 
has lost its jelly-like consistency ; not after clearing is 
effected. Many think the flavor obtained from a few shav- 
ings of lemon rind an agreeable addition. 

How to Bind Soups 

Cream soups and purees, if allowed to stand, separate, 
unless bound together. To bind a soup, melt butter, and 
when bubbling add an equal quantity of flour; when well 
mixed add to boiling soup, stirring constantly. If recipe 
calls for more flour than butter, or soup is one that should 
be made in double boiler, add gradually a portion of hot 
mixture to butter and flour until of such consistency that it 
may be poured into the mixture remaining in double boiler.

FISH 151 



CHAPTER XI 

FISH 

THE meat of fish is the animal food next in importance 
to that of birds and mammals. Fish meat, with but 
few exceptions, is less stimulating and nourishing than meat 
of other animals, but is usually easier of digestion. Salmon, 
mackerel, and eels are exceptions to these rules, and should 
not be eaten by those of weak digestion. White fish, on 
account of their easy digestibility, are especially desirable 
for those of sedentary habits. Fish is not recommended for 
brain-workers on account of the large amount of phosphorus 
(an element abounding largely in nerve tissue) which it con- 
tains, but because of its easy digestibility. It is a conceded 
fact that many fish contain less of this element than meat. 

Fish meat is generally considered cheaper than meat of 
other animals. This is true when compared with the better 
cuts of meat, but not so when compared with cheaper cuts. 

To obtain from fish its greatest value and flavor, it should 
be eaten fresh, and in season. Turbot, which is improved 
by keeping, is the only exception to this rule. 

To Determine Freshness of Fish. Examine the flesh, and 
it should be firm; the eyes and gills, and they should be 

bright. 

Broiling and baking are best methods for cooking fish. 
White fish may often be fried, but oily rarely. Frozen fish 
are undesirable, but if used, should be thawed in cold water 
just before cooking. 

On account of its strong odor, fish should never be put in 
an ice-box with other food, unless closely covered. A tin 
lard pail will be found useful for this purpose. 



152 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

White and Oily Fish 

White fish have fat secreted in the liver. Examples : cod, 
haddock, trout, flounder, smelt, perch, etc. 

Oily fish have fat distributed throughout the flesh. Ex- 
amples: salmon, eels, mackerel, bluefish, swordfish, shad, 
herring, etc. 

Cod belongs to one of the most prolific fish families 
(Gadidoe), and is widely distributed throughout the northern 
and temperate seas of both hemispheres. On account of its 
abundance, cheapness, and easy procurability, it forms, 
from an economical standpoint, one of the most important 
fish foods. Cod have been caught weighing over a hundred 
pounds, but average market cod weigh from six to ten 
pounds ; a six-pound cod measures about twenty-three inches 
in length. Large cod are cut into steaks. The skin of cod 
is white, heavily mottled with gray, with a white line run- 
ning the entire length of fish on either side. Cod is caught 
in shallow or deep waters. Shallow-water cod (caught off 
rocks) is called rock cod ; deep-water cod is called off-shore 
cod. Rock cod are apt to be wormy. Cod obtained off 
George's Banks, Newfoundland, are called George's cod, 
and are commercially known as the best fish. Quantities of 
cod are preserved by drying and salting. Salted George's 
cod is the best brand on the market Cod is in season 
throughout the year. 

Cod Liver Oil is obtained from cods' livers, and has great 
therapeutic value. Isinglass, made from swimming bladder 
of cod, nearly equals in quality that made from bladder of 
sturgeon. 

Haddock is more closely allied to cod than any other fish. 
It is smaller (its average weight being about four pounds), 
and differently mottled. The distinguishing mark of the 
haddock is a black line running the entire length of fish on 
either side. Haddock is found in the same water and in 
company with cod, but not so abundantly. Like cod, had- 
dock is cheap, and in season throughout the year. Haddock, 
when dried, smoked, and salted, is known as Finnan Haddie. 

Halibut is the largest of the flatfish family (Pleuronectidse), 



FISH 153 

specimens having been caught weighing from three to four 
hundred pounds. Small, or chicken, halibut is the kind 
usually found in market, and weighs from fifteen to twenty- 
five pounds. Halibut are distinctively cold-water fish, being 
caught in water at from 32° to 45° F. They are found in 
the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, where they are 
nearly identical. The halibut has a compressed body, the 
akin on one side being white, on the other light, or dark gray, 
and both eyes are found on the dark side of head. Halibut 
is in season throughout the year. 

Turbot (called little halibut) is a species of the flatfish 
family, being smaller than halibut, and of more delicate 
flavor. Turbot are in season from January to March. 

Flounder is a small flatfish, which closely resembles the 
sole which is caught in English waters, and is often served 
under that name. 

Trout are generally fresh-water fish, varying much in size 
and skin-coloring. Lake trout, which are the largest, reach 
their greatest perfection in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and 
Superior, but are found in many lakes. Salmon trout is the 
name applied to trout caught in New York lakes. Brook 
trout, caught in brooks and small lakes, are superior eating. 
Trout are in season from April to August, but a few are 
found later. 

Whitefish is the finest fish found in the Great Lakes. 

Smelts are small salt-water fish, and are usually caught in 
temperate waters at the mouths of rivers. New Brunswick 
and Maine send large quantities of smelts to market. 
Selected smelts are the largest in size, and command higher 
price. The Massachusetts Fish and Game Protective Law 
forbids their sale from March 15th to June 1st Smelts are 
always sold by the pound. 

Bluefish belongs to the Pomatomidse family. It is widely 
distributed in temperate waters, taking different names in 
different localities. In New England and the Middle States 
it is generally called Bluefish, although in some parts called 
Snappers, or Snapping Mackerel. In the Southern States it 
is called Greenfish. It is in season in our markets from May 
to October; as it is frozen and kept in cold storage from 



154 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

six to nine months, it may be obtained throughout the year. 
The heavier the fish, the better lis quality. Blaefish weigh 
from one to eight pounds, and are from fourteen to twenty* 
nine inches in length. 

Mackerel is one of the best-known food fishes, and is 
caught in North Atlantic waters. Its skin is lustrous dark 
blue above, with wavy blackish lines, and silvery below. It 
sometimes attains a length of eighteen inches, but is usually 
less. Mackerel weigh from three-fourths of a pound to two 
pounds, and are sold by the piece. They are in season from 
May 1st to September 1st. Mackerel, when first in market, 
contain less fat than later in the season, therefore are easier 
of digestion. The supply of mackerel varies greatly from 
year to year, and some years is very small. Spanish 
mackerel are found in waters farther south than common 
mackerel, and in our markets command higher price. 

Salmon live in both fresh and salt waters, always going, 
inland, usually to the head of rivers, during the spawning 
season. The young after a time seek salt water, but 
generally return to fresh water. Penobscot River Salmon 
are the best, and come from Maine and St John, New 
Brunswick. The average weight of salmon is from fifteen 
to twenty-five pounds, and the flesh is of pinkish orange 
color. Salmon are in season from May to September, but 
frozen salmon may be obtained the greater part of the year. 
In the Columbia River and its tributaries salmon are so abun- 
dant that extensive canneries are built along the banks. 

Shad, like salmon, are found in both salt and fresh water, 
always ascending rivers for spawning. Shad is caught on 
the Atlantic Coast of the United States, and its capture con- 
stitutes one of the most important fisheries. Shad have a 
silvery hue, which becomes bluish on the back ; they vary in 
length from eighteen to twenty-eight inches, and are always 
sold by the piece, price being irrespective of size. Jack shad 
are usually cheaper than roe shad. The roe of shad is highly 
esteemed. Shad are in season from January to June. First 
shad in market come from Florida, and retail from one and 
one-half to two dollars each. The finest come from N< 
Brunswick, and appear in market about the first of May. 



SHELLFISH 155 

Caviare is the salted roe of the sturgeon. 
Herring are usually smoked, or smoked and salted, and, 
being very cheap, are a most economical food. 



SHELLFISH 

I. Bivalve Mollaska 

Oysters are mollusks, having two shells. The shells are 
on the right and left side of the oyster, and are called right 
and left valves. The one upon which the oyster re9ts grows 
faster, becomes deeper, and is known as the left valve. 
The valves are fastened by a ligament, which, on account of 
its elasticity, admits of opening and closing of the shells. 
The oyster contains a tough muscle, by which it is attached 
to the shell ; the body is made up largely of the liver (which 
contains glycogen, animal starch), and is partially surrounded 
by fluted layers, which are the gills. Natural oyster beds 
(or banks) are found in shallow salt water having stony bot- 
tom, along tbe entire Atlantic Coast. The oyster industry 
of the world is chiefly in the United States and France, and 
on account of its increase many artificial beds have been 
prepared for oyster culture. Oysters are five years old be- 
fore suitable for eating. Blue Points, which are small, 
plump oysters, take their name from Blue Point, Long 
Island, from which place they originally came. Their popu- 
larity grew so rapidly that the supply became inadequate for 
the demand, and any small, plump oysters were soon sold 
for Blue Points. During the oyster season they form the 
first course of a dinner, served raw on the half-shell. In 
our markets, selected oysters (which are extremely large and 
used for broiling) Providence River, and Norfolk oysters are 
familiarly known, and, taken out of the shells, are sold by 
tbe quart. Farther south, they are sold by count. 

Oysters are obtainable all the year, bat are in season from 
September to May. During the summer months they are 
flabby and of poor flavor, although when fresh they are per- 
fectly wholesome. Mussels, eaten in England and other 
part3 of Europe, arc similar to oysters, though Qt inferior, 



156 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

quality. Oysters are nutritious and of easy digestibility, 
especially when eaten raw. 

To Open Oysters. Pat a thin flat knife under the back 
end of the right valve, and push forward until it cuts the 
strong muscle which holds the shells together. As soon as 
this is done, the right valve may be raised and separated 
from the left. 

To Clean Oysters* Put oysters in a strainer placed over a 
bowl. Pour over oysters cold water, allowing one-half cup 
water to each quart oysters. Carefully pick over oysters, 
taking each one separately in the Angers, to remove any 
particles of shell which adhere to tough muscle. 

Clams, among bivalve mollusks, rank in value next to 
oysters. They are found just below the surface of sand and 
mud, above low-water mark, and are easily dug with shovel or 
rake. Clams have hard or soft shells. Soft-shell clams are 
dear to the New finglander. From New York to Florida 
are found hard-shelled clams (quahaugs). Small qualiaugs 
are called Little Neck Clams and take the place of Blue 
Points at dinner, when Blue Points are out of season. 

Scallops are bivalve mollusks, the best being found in 
Long Island Sound and Narragansett Bay. The central 
muscle forms the edible portion, and is the only part sent to 
market. Scallops are in season from October f.rst to April 
first. 

II. Crustaceans 

Lobsters belong to the highest order of Crustaceans, live 
exclusively in sea-water, generally near rocky coasts, and 
are caught in pots set on gravelly bottoms. The largest 
and best species are found in Atlantic waters from Maine 
to New Jersey, being most abundant on Maine and Massa- 
chusetts coasts. Lobsters have been found weighing from 
sixteen to twenty-five pounds, but such have been exter- 
minated from our coast The average weight is two 
pounds, and the length from ten to fifteen inches. Lob- 
sters are largest and most abundant from June to Septem- 
ber, but are obtainable all the year. When taken from 
the water, shells are of mottled dark green color, except 



SHELLFISH 157 

when found on sandy bottoms, when they are quite red. 
Lobsters are generally boiled, causing the shell to turn 
red. 

A lobster consists of body, tail, two large claws, and 
four pairs of small claws. On lower side of body, in front 
of large claws, are various small organs which surround 
the mouth, and a long and short pair of feelers. Under 
the tail are found several pairs of appendages. In the 
female lobster, also called hen lobster, is found, during 
the breeding season, the spawn, known as coral. Sex is 
determined by the pair of appendages in the tail which lie 
nearest the body ; in the female they are soft and pliable, 
in the male hard and stiff. At one time small lobsters 
were taken in such quantities that it was feared, if the 
practice was long continued, they would be exterminated. 
To protect the continuance of lobster fisheries, a law has 
been passed in many States prohibiting their sale unless 
at least ten inches long. 

Lobsters shed their shells at irregular intervals, when 
old ones are outgrown. The new ones begin to form and 
take on distinctive characteristics before the old ones are 
discarded. New shells after twenty-four hours' exposure 
to the water are quite hard. 

Lobsters, being coarse feeders (taking almost any animal 
substance attainable), are difficult of digestion, and with 
some create great gastric disturbance; notwithstanding) 
they are seldom found diseased. 

To Select a Lobster. Take in the hand, and if heavy in 
proportion to its size, the lobster is fresh. Straighten the 
tail, and if it springs into place the lobster was alive (as it 
should have been) when put into the pot for boiling. There 
is greater shrinkage in lobsters than in any other fish. 

To Open Lobsters. Take off large claws, small claws, 
and separate tail from body. Tail meat may sometimes 
be drawn out whole with a fork ; more often it is neces- 
sary to cut the thin shell portion (using scissors or a can- 
opener) in under part of the tail, then the tail meat may 
always be removed whole. Separate tail meat through 
centre, and remove the small intestinal vein which runs 



158 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

its entire length ; although generally darker than the meat, 
it is sometimes found of the same color. Hold body shell 
firmly in left hand, and with first two fingers and thumb of 
right hand draw out the body, leaving in shell the stomach 
(known is the lady), which is not edible, and also some of 
the green part, the liver. The liver may be removed by 
shaking the shell. The sides of the body are covered with 
the lungs ; these are always discarded. Break body through 
the middle and separate body bones, picking out meat that 
lies between them, which is some of the sweetest and ten- 
derest to be found. Separate large claws at joints. If 
shells are thin, with a knife cut off a strip down the sharp 
edge, so that shell may be broken apart and meat removed 
whole. Where shell is thick, it must be broken with a 
mallet or hammer. Small claws are used for garnishing. 
The shell of body, tail, and lower part of large claws, if not 
broken, may be washed, dried, and used for serving of 
lobster meat after it has been prepared. The portions of 
lobsters which are not edible are lungs, stomach (lady), and 
intestinal vein. 

Crabs among Crustaceans are next in importance to lob- 
sters, commercially speaking. They are about two and one- 
half inches long by five inches wide, and are found along 
the Atlantic Coast from Massachusetts to Florida, and in the 
Gulf of Mexico. Crabs, like lobsters, change their shells. 
Soft-shell crabs are those which have recently shed their old 
shells, and the new shells have not had time to harden ; these 
are considered by many a great luxury. Oyster crabs (very 
small crabs found in shells with oysters) are a delicacy not 
often indulged in. Crabs are in season during the spring 
and summer. 

Shrimps are found largely in our Southern waters, the 
largest and best coming from Lake Pontchartrain. They 
are about two inches long, covered with a thin shell, and are 
boiled and sent to market with heads removed. Their gray- 
ish color is changed to pink by boiling. Shrimps are in sea- 
son from May first to October first, and are generally used 
for salads. Canned shrimps are much used and favorably 
known. 



SHELLFISH 159 

Reptiles. Frogs and terrapin belong to a lower order of 
animals than fish, — reptiles. They are both table delica- 
cies, and are eaten by the few. 

Only the hind legs of frogs are eaten, and have much the 
same flavor as chicken. 

Terrapin, although sold in our large cities, specially be- 
long to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, where they 
are cooked and served at their best. They are shipped from 
the South, packed in seaweed, and may be kept for some 
time in a dark place. Terrapin are found in both fresh and 
salt water. The Diamond Back, salt-water terrapin, coming 
from Chesapeake Bay, are considered the best, and command 
a very high price. Terrapin closely resembling Diamond 
Back, coming from Texas and Florida, are principally sold 
in our markets. Terrapin are in season from November to 
April, but are best in January, February, and March. They 
should always be cooked alive. 

TO PEEPAEE FISH FOR COOKING 

To Clean a Fish. Fish are cleaned and dressed at mar- 
ket as ordered, but need additional cleaning before cooking. 
Remove scales which have not been taken off. This is done 
by drawing a knife over fish, beginning at tail and working 
towards head, occasionally wiping knife and scales from fish. 
Incline knife slightly towards you to prevent scales from 
flying. The largest number of scales will be found on the 
flank. Wipe thoroughly inside and out with cloth wrung out 
of cold water, removing any clotted blood which may be 
found adhering to backbone. 

Head and tail may or may not be removed, according to 
size of fish and manner of cooking. Small fish are generally 
served with head and tail left on. 

To Skin a Fish. With sharp knife remove fins along the 
back and cut off a narrow strip of skin the entire length of 
back. Loosen skin on one side from bony part of gills, and 
being once started, if fish is fresh, it may be readily drawn 
off; if flesh is soft do not work too quickly, as it will be 
badly torn. By allowing knife to closely follow skin this 



160 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

may be avoided. After removing skin from one Bide, torn 
fish and skin the other side. 

To Bone a Fish. Clean and skin before boning. Begin- 
ning at the tail, run a sharp knife under flesh close to back- 
bone, and with knife follow bone (making as clean a cut as 
possible) its entire length, thus accomplishing the removal of 
one-half the flesh ; turn, and remove flesh from other side. 
Pick out with fingers any small bones that may remain. 
Cod, haddock, halibut, and whitefish are easily and fre- 
quently boned ; flounders and smelts occasionally. 

To Fillet Fish. Clean, skin, and bone. A piece of fish, 
large or small, freed from skin and bones, is known as a 
fillet. Halibut, cut in three-fourths inch slices, is more often 
cut in fillets than any kind of fish, and fillets are frequently 
rolled. When flounder is cut in fillets it is served under the 
name of fillet of sole. Sole found in English waters is much 
esteemed, and flounder is our nearest approach to it 

WATS OF COOKING FISH 

To Cook Fish in Boiling Water. Small cod, haddock, or 
cusk are cooked whole in enough boiling water to cover, to 
which is added salt and lemon juice or vinegar. Salt gives 
flavor ; lemon juice or vinegar keeps the flesh white. A long 
fish-kettle containing a rack on which to place fish is useful 
but rathet expensive. In place of fish-kettle, if the fish is 
not too large to be coiled in it, a frying-basket may be used 
placed in any kettle. 

Large fish are cut in thick pieces for boiling, containing 
the number of pounds required. Examples: salmon and 
halibut. 

Pieces cut from large fish for boiling should be cleaned 
and tied in a piece of cheesecloth to prevent scum being 
deposited on the fish. If skin is not removed before serv- 
ing., scald the dark skin and scrape to remove coloring ; this 
may be easily accomplished by holding fish on two forks, 
and lowering into boiling water the part covered with black 
skin ; then remove and scrape. Time required for boiling 
fish depends on extent of surface exposed to water. Con*

rait Time-Table for Boiling, which will serve as a guide. 
The fish is cooked when flesh leaves the bone, do matter 
how long the time. 

To Broil Fish. Cod, haddock, blaefish, and mackerel are 
split down the back and broiled whole, removing head and 
tail or not, as desired. Salmon, chicken halibut, and sword- 
fish are cut in inch slices for broiling. Smelts and other 
small fish are broiled whole, without splitting. Clean and 
wipe fish as dry as possible, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
and place in well-greased wire broiler. Slices of fish should 
be turned often while broiling; whole fish should be first 
broiled on flesh side, then turned and broiled on skin side just 
long enough to make skin brown and crisp. 

To remove from broiler, loosen fish on one side, turn and 
loosen on other side ; otherwise flesh will cling to broiler. 
Slip from broiler to hot platter, or place platter over fish and 
invert platter and broiler together. 

To Bake Fish. Clean, and bake on a greased fish-sheet 
placed in a dripping-pan. If a fish-sheet is not at hand, 
place strips of cotton cloth under fish, by which it may be 
lifted from pan. 

To Fry Fish. Clean fish, and wipe as dry as possible 
Sprinkle with salt, dip in flour or crumbs, egg, and crumbs, 
and fry in deep fat. 

To Sauttf Fish. Prepare as for frying, and cook in frying- 
pan with small amount of fat ; or, if preferred, dip in granu- 
lated corn meal. Cod steak and smelts are often cooked in 
this way.

CHAPTER Xn 



MEAT is the name applied to the flesh of all animals 
used for food. Beef is the meat of steer, ox, or 
cow, and is the most nutritious and largely consumed of 
all animal foods. Meat is chiefly composed of the albumi- 
noids (fibrin, albumen, gelatin), fat, mineral matter, and 
water. 

Fibrin is that substance in blood which causes it to 
coagulate when shed. It consists of innumerable delicate 
fibrils which entangle the blood corpuscles, and form with 
them a mass called blood clot. Fibrin is insoluble in both 
cold and hot water. 

Albumen is a substance found in the blood and muscle. 
It is soluble iu cold water, and is coagulated by hot water 
or heat. It begins to coagulate at 134° F. and becomes 
solid at 160° F. Here lies the necessity of cooking meat 
in hot water at a low temperature; of broiling meat at a 
high temperature, to quickly sear surface. 

Gelatin in its raw state is termed collagen. It is a 
transparent, tasteless substance, obtained by boiling with 
water, muscle, skin, cartilage, bone, tendon, ligament, or 
membrane of animals. By this process, collagen of con- 
nective tissues is dissolved and converted into gelatin. 
Gelatin is insoluble in cold water, soluble in hot water, 
but in boiling water is decomposed, and by much boiling 
will not solidify on cooling. When subjected to cold water 
it swells, and is called hydrated gelatin. Myosin is the 
albuminoid of muscle, collagen of tendons, ossein of bones, 
and chondrin of cartilage and gristle. 

Gelatin, although highly nitrogenous, does not act in the 
system as other nitrogenous foods, as a large quantity passes 
out unchanged.

The Effect of Different Temperatures on the 

Cooking of Meat 

By putting meat in cold water and allowing water to beat 
gradually, a large amount of juice is extracted and meat is 
tasteless; and by long cooking the connective tissues are 
softened and dissolved, which gives to the stock when cold t 
jelly-like consistency. This principle applies to soup-making. 

By putting meat in boiling water, allowing the water to 
boil for a few minutes, then lowering the temperature, 
juices in the outer surface are quickly coagulated, and the 
inner juices are prevented from escaping. This principle 
applies where nutriment and flavor is desired in meat. Ex- 
amples : boiled mutton, fowl. 

By putting in cold water, bringing quickly to the boiling- 
point, then lowering the temperature and cooking slowly 
until meat is tender, some of the goodness will be in the 
stock, but a large portion left in the meat. Examples : fowl, 
when cooked to use for made over dishes, Scotch Broth.

Broiled Beefsteak 

The best cuts of beef for broiling are porterhouse, sirloin, 
cross-cut of rump steaks, and second and third cuts from top 



196 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

of round. Porterhouse and sirloin cuts are the most expen- 
sive, on account of the great loss in bone and fat, although 
price per pound is about the same as for cross-cut of rump. 
Round steak is very juicy, but, having coarser fibre, is not 
as tender. Steaks should be cut at least an inch thick, and 
from that to two and one-half inches. The flank end of sir- 
loin steak should be removed before cooking. It may be pat 
in soup kettle, or lean part may be chopped and utilized for 
meat cakes, fat tried out and clarified for shortening. 

To Broil Steak. Wipe with a cloth wrung out of cold 
water, and trim off superfluous fat. With some of the fat 
grease a wire broiler, place meat in broiler (having fat edge 
next to handle) , and broil over a clear fire, turning every 
ten seconds for the first minute, that surface may be well 
seared, thus preventing escape of juices. After the first 
minute, turn occasionally until well cooked on both sides. 
Steak cut one inch thick will take five minutes, if liked rare; 
six minutes, if well done. Remove to hot platter, spread 
with butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

utes. Baste every five minutes with one-fourth cup butter 
melted in one cup boiling water. Serve with Brown Mush- 
room Sauce I. 

Roast Beef 

The best cuts of beef for roasting are : tip or middle of 
sirloin, back of rump, or first three ribs. Tip of sirloin 
roast is desirable for a small family. Back of rump makes 
a superior roast for a large family, and is more economical 
than sirloin. It is especially desirable where a large quan- 
tity of dish gravy is liked, for in carving the meat juices fol- 
low the knife. Rib roasts contain more fat than either of 
the others, and are somewhat cheaper. 

To Roast Beef. Wipe, put on a rack in dripping-pan, 
©kin side down, rub over with salt, and dredge meat and pan 
with flour. Place in hot oven, that the surface may be 
quickly seared, thus preventing escape of inner juices. 
After flour in pan is browned, reduce heat, and baste with 
fat which has tried out; if meat is quite lean, it may be neces- 
sary to put trimmings of fat in pan. Baste every ten min- 
utes; if this rule is followed, meat will be found more juicy. 
When meat is about half done, turn it over and dredge with 
flour, that skin side may be uppermost for final browning. 
For roasting, consult Time Table for Baking Meats, page 30. 

If there is danger of flour burning in pan, add a small 
quantity of water ; this, however, is not desirable, and seldom 
need be done if size of pan is adapted to size of roast. Beef 
to be well roasted should be started in hot oven and heat 
decreased, so that when carved the slices will be red through- 
oat, with a crisp layer of golden brown fat on the top. 



202 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Beef roasted when temperature is so high that surface is 
hardened before heat can penetrate to the centre is most 
unsatisfactory. 

Sirloin or rib roasts may have the bones removed, and be 
rolled, skewered, and tied in shape. Chicago Butt is cut 
from the most tender part of back of rump. They are 
shipped from Chicago, our greatest beef centre, and if fresh 
and from a heavy creature, make excellent roasts at a small 
price. 

Roast Beef Gravy. Remove some of the fat from pan, 
leaving four tablespoons. Place on front of range, add 
four tablespoons flour, and stir until well browned. The 
flour, dredged and browned in pan, should give additional 
color to gravy. Add gradually one and one-half cups boil- 
ing water, cook Ave minutes, season with salt and pepper, 
and strain. If flour should burn in pan, gravy will be fall 
of black particles. 

To Carve a Roast of Beef. Have roast placed on 
platter skin side up ; with a pointed, thin-bladed, sharp knife 
cut a sirloin or rib roast in thin slices at right angles to the 
ribs, and cut slices from ribs. If there is tenderloin, remove 
it from under the bone, and cut in thin slices across grain 
of meat. Carve back of rump in thin slices with the grain of 
meat ; by so doing, some of the least tender muscle will be 
served with that which is tender. By cutting across grain 
of meat, the tenderest portion is sliced by itself, as is the 
less tender portion.

Larded Fillet of Beef 

The tenderloin of beef which lies under the loin and romp 
is called fillet of beef. The fillet under the loin is known 
as the long fillet, and when removed no porterhouse steaks 
can be cut ; therefore it commands a higher price than the 
short fillet lying under rump. Two short fillets are often 
skewered together, and served in place of a long fillet. 

Wipe, remove fat, veins, and any tendonons portions; 
skewer in shape, and lard upper side with grain of meat, 
following directions for larding on page 23. Place on a rack 
in small pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with 
flour, and put in bottom of pan small pieces of pork. Bake 
twenty to thirty minutes in hot oven, basting three times. 
Take out skewer, remove meat to hot platter, and garnish 
with watercress. Serve with Mushroom, Figaro, or Horse- 
radish Sauce I. 

Fillet of Beef with Vegetables 

Wipe a three- pound fillet, trim, and remove fat. Put one- 
half pound butter in hot frying-pan and when melted add 
fillet, and turn frequently until the entire surface is seared 
and well browned; then turn occasionally until done, the 
time required being about thirty minutes. Remove to 
serving dish and garnish with one cup each cooked peas and 
carrots cut in fancy shapes, both well seasoned, one-half cup 
raisins seeded and cooked in boiling water until soft, and 
the caps from one-half pound fresh mushrooms sautdd in 
butter five minutes. Serve with 

Brown Mushroom Sauce. Pour off one-fourth cup fat 
from frying-pan. add five tablespoons flour, and stir until 
well browned ; then add one cup Brown Soup Stock, one- 
third cup mushroom liquor, and the caps from one-half pound 
mushrooms cut in slices and sauted in butter three minutes. 
Season with salt and pepper, and just before serving add 
gradually, while stirring constantly, the butter remaining in 
frying-pan. 

To obtain mushroom liquor, scrape stems of mushrooms, 
break in pieces, cover with cold water, and cools slowly untU 
liquid is reduced to one-third cup.

kept below the boiling-point. Serve with Horseradish Sauce, 
or with sauce made from liquor in pan. 

Beef a la Mode 

Insert twelve large lardoons in a four-pound piece of beef 
cut from the round. Make incisions for lardoons by running 
through the meat a large skewer. Season with salt and pep- 
per, dredge with flour, and brown the entire surface in pork fat 
Put on a trivet in kettle, surround with one-third cup each 
carrot, turnip, celery, and onion cut in dice, sprig of parsley, 
bit of bay leaf, and water to half cover meat. Cover closely, 
and cook slowly four hours, keeping liquor below the boiling- 
point. Remove to hot platter. Strain liquor, thicken and 
season to serve as a gravy. When beef is similarly prepared 
(with exception of lardoons and vegetables), and cooked in 
smaller amount of water, it is called Smothered Beef, or Pot 
Roast. A bean-pot (covered with a piece of buttered paper, 
tied firmly down) is the best utensil to use for a Pot Roast. 

Pressed Beef Flank 

Wipe, remove superfluous fat, and roll a flank of beef 
Put in a kettle, cover with boiling water, and add one 
tablespoon salt, one-half teaspoon peppercorns, a bit of bay 
leaf, and a bone or two which may be at hand. Cook 
slowly until meat is in shreds; there should be bat little 



BEEF 205 

liquor in kettle when meat is done. Arrange meat in a deep 
pan, pour over liquor, cover, and press with a heavy weight 
Serve cold, thinly sliced. 

Beef Stew with Dumplings 

Aitchbone, weighing 5 lbs. y 2 small onion, cut in thin 

4 cups potatoes, cut in J£ inch slices 

slices % cup flour 

Turnip \ % cup each, cut in Salt 

Carrot \ half-inch cubes Pepper 

Wipe meat, remove from bone, cut in one and one-half 
inch cubes, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dredge with 
floor. Cut some of the fat in small pieces and try out in 
frying-pan. Add meat and stir constantly, that the surface 
may be quickly seared ; when well browned, put in kettle, 
and rinse frying-pan with boiling water, that none of the 
goodness may be lost. Add to meat remaining fat, and 
boue sawed in pieces ; cover with boiling water and boil five 
minutes, then cook at a lower temperature until meat is ten- 
der (time required being about three hours). Add carrot, 
turnip, and onion, with salt and pepper the last hour of 
cooking. Parboil potatoes five minutes, and add to stew 
fifteen minutes before taking from fire. Remove bones, 
large pieces of fat, and then skim. Thicken with one- 
fourth cup flour, diluted with enough cold water to pour 
easily. Pour in deep hot platter, and surround with dump- 
lings. Remnants of roast beef are usually made into a beef 
stew ; the meat having been once cooked, there is no neces- 
sity of browning it. If gravy is left, it should be added to 
the stew. 

Dumplings 
2 cups flour % teaspoon salt 

4 teaspoons baking powder 2 teaspoons butter 

% cup milk 

Mix and sift dry ingredients. Work in butter with tips of 
fingers, and add milk gradually, using a knife for mixing. 
Toss on a floured board, pat, and roll out to one-half inch in 
thickness. Shape with biscuit-cutter, first dipped in flour. 
Place closely together in a buttered steamer, put over kettle of 
boiling water, cover closely, and steam twelve minutes. A 



206 BOSTON COOKING-8OH0OL COOK BOOK 

perforated tin pie-plate may be used in place of steamer. A 
little more milk may be used in tbe mixture, when it may be 
taken up by spoonfuls, dropped and cooked on top of stew. 
In this case some of the liquid must be removed, that dump- 
lings may rest on meat and potato, and not settle into 
liquid. 

Corned Beef 

Corned beef has but little nutritive value. It is used to 
give variety to our diet in summer, when fresh meats prove 
too stimulating. It is eaten by the workingman to give 
bulk to his food. The best pieces of corned beef are the 
rattle rand and fancy brisket. The fancy brisket com- 
mands a higher price and may be easily told from the rattle 
rand by the selvage on lower side and the absence of bones. 
The upper end of brisket (butt end) is thick and composed 
mostly of lean meat, the middle cut has more fat but is not 
well mixed, while the lower (navel end) has a large quantity 
of fat. The rattle rand contains a thick lean end ; the 
second cut contains three distinct layers of meat and fat, 
and is considered the best cut by those who prefer meat 
well streaked with fat. The rattle rand has a thin end, 
which contains but one layer of lean meat and much fat, 
consequently is not a desirable piece. 

To Boil Corned Beef. Wipe tbe meat and tie securely in 
shape, if this has not been already done at market Pat 
in kettle, cover with cold water, and bring slowly to boiling- 
point. Boil five minutes, remove scum, and cook at a lower 
temperature until tender. Cool slightly in water in which it 
was cooked, remove to a dish, cover, and place on cover a 
weight, that meat may be well pressed. The lean meat and 
fat may be separated and put in alternate layers in a 
bread pan, then covered and pressed. 

Boiled Dinner 

A boiled dinner consists of warm impressed corned beef, 
served with cabbage, beets, turnips, carrots, and potatoes. 
After removing meat from water, skim off fat and cook 
vegetables (with exception of beets, which require a long 



BERF 207 

time for cooking) in this water. Carrots require a longer 
time for cooking than cabbage or turnips. Carrots and 
turnips, if small, may be cooked whole ; if large, cut in 
pieces. Cabbage and beets are served in separate dishes, 
other vegetables on same dish with meat. 

Boiled Tongue 

A boiled corned tongue is cooked the same as Boiled 
Corned Beef. If very salt,- it should be soaked in cold 
water several hours, or over night, before cooking. Take 
from water when slightly cooled and remove skin. 

Braised Tongue 

A fresh tongue is necessary for braising. Put tongue 
in kettle, cover with boiling water, and cook slowly two 
hours. Take tongue from water and remove skin and roots. 
Place in deep pan and surround with one-third cup each 
carrot, onion, and celery, cut in dice, and one sprig parsley ; 
then pour over four cups sauce. Cover closely, and bake 
two hours, turning after the first hour. Serve on platter 
and strain around the sauce. 

Sauce for Tongue. Brown one-fourth cup butter, add 
one-fourth cup flour and stir together until well browned. 
Add gradually four cups of water in which tongue was 
cooked. Season with salt and pepper and add one teaspoon 
Worcestershire Sauce. One and one-half cups stewed and 
strained tomatoes may be used in place of some of the 
water. 

Broiled Liver 

Cover with boiling water slices of liver cut one-half inch 
thick, let stand five minutes to draw out the blood ; drain, 
wipe, and remove the thin outside skin and veins. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, place in a greased wire broiler and 
broil five minutes, turning often. Remove to a hot platter, 
spread with butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. 

Liver and Baoon

CHAPTER XIII 
LAMB AND MUTTON 

LAMB is the name given to the meat of lambs ; mutton, 
to the meat of sheep. Lamb, coming as it does from 
the young creature, is immature, and less nutritious than 
mutton. The flesh of mutton ranks with the flesh of beef in 
nutritive value and digestibility. The fat of mutton, on ac- 
count of its larger percentage of stearic acid, is more difficult 
of digestion than the fat of beef. 

Lamb may be eaten soon after the animal is killed and 
dressed ; mutton must hang to ripen. Good mutton comes 
from a sheep about three years old, and should hang from 
two to three weeks. The English South Down Mutton is cut 
from creatures even older than three years. Young lamb, 
when killed from six weeks to three months old, is called 
spring lamb, and appears in the market as early as the last 
of January, but is very scarce until March. Lamb one year 
old is called a yearling. Many object to the strong flavor of 
mutton ; this is greatly overcome by removing the pink skin 
and trimming off superfluous fat. 

Lamb and mutton are divided into two parts by catting 
through entire length of backbone; then subdivided into 
fore and hind quarter, eight ribs being left on hind quarter, 
— while in beef but three ribs are left on hind-quarter. 
These eight ribs are cut into chops and are known as rib 
chops. The meat which lies between these ribs and the leg. 
cut into chops, is known as loin or kidney chops* 

Lamb and mutton chops cut from loin have a small piece 
of tenderloin on one side of bone, and correspond to porter- 
house steaks in the beef creature, Eib chops which have the 



j 



LAMB AND MUTTON 215 

bone cat short and scraped clean, nearly to the lean meat, 
are called French chops. 

The leg is sold whole for boiling or roasting. The fore- 
quarter may be boned, staffed, rolled, and roasted, but is 
more often used for broth, stew, or fricassee. 

For a saddle of mutton the loin is removed whole before 
splitting" the creature. Some of the bones are removed and 
the flank ends are rolled, fastened with wooden skewers, 
and securely tied to keep skewers in place. 

Good quality mutton should be fine-grained and of bright 
pink color ; the fat white, hard, and flaky. If the outside 
skin comes off easily, mutton is sure to be good. Lamb 
chops may be easily distinguished from mutton chops by the 
red color of bone. As lamb grows older, blood recedes 
from bones ; therefore in mutton the bone is white. In leg 
of lamb the bone at joint is serrated, while in leg of mutton 
the bone at joint is smooth and rounded. Good mutton 
contains a larger proportion of fat than good beef. Poor 
mutton is often told by the relatively small proportion of 
fat and lean as compared to bone. 

Lamb is usually preferred well done; mutton is often 
cooked rare. 

Broiled Lamb or Mutton Chops 

Wipe chops, remove superfluous fat, and place in a broiler 
greased with some of mutton fat. In loin chops, flank may 
be rolled and fastened with a small wooden skewer. Follow 
directions for Broiling Beefsteak on page 196. 

Pan-broiled Chops 

Chops for pan broiling should have flank and most of fat 
removed. Wipe chops and put in hissing hot frying-pan. 

Turn as soon as under surface is seared, and sear other 
side. Turn often, using knife and fork that the surface 
may not be pierced, as would be liable if fork alone were 
used. Cook six minutes if liked rare, eight to ten minutes 
if liked well done. Let stand around edge of frying-pan to 
brown the outside fat. When half cooked, sprinkle with 
salt. Drain on brown paper, put on hot platter, and spread 
with batter or serve with Tomato or Soubise Sauce* 



216 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Breaded Mutton Chops 
Wipe and trim chops, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip 
in crumbs, egg, and crumbs, fry in deep fat from five to 
eight minutes, and drain. Serve with Tomato Sauce, or 
stack around a mound of mashed potatoes, fried potato 
balls, or green peas. Never fry but four at a time, and 
allow fat to reheat between fryings. After testing fat for 
temperature, put in chops and place kettle on back of range, 
that surface of chops may not be too brown while the inside 
is still underdone. 

Chops a la Signora 

Gash French Chops on outer edge, extending cut half- 
way through lean meat. Insert in each gash a slice of 
truffle, sprinkle with salt and pepper, wrap in calf s caul. 
Roll in flour, dip in egg, then in stale bread crumbs, and 
saute in butter eight minutes, turning often. Place in oven 
four minutes to finish cooking. Arrange on hot platter for 
serving, and place on top of each a fresh broiled mushroom 
or mushroom baked in cream. To fat in pan add a small 
quantity of boiling water and pour around chops. This is a 
delicious way of cooking chops for a dinner party. 

Lamb Chops a la Marseilles 

Pan broil, on one side, six French chops, cover cooked

CHAPTER XIV 

VEAL 

VEAL is the meat obtained from a young calf killed 
when six to eight weeks old. Veal from a younger 
animal is very unwholesome, and is liable to provoke serious 
gastric disturbances. Veal contains a much smaller per- 
centage of fat than beef or mutton, is less nutritious, and 
(though from a young creature) more difficult of digestion. 
Like lamb, it is not improved by long hanging, but should 
be eaten soon after killing and dressing. It should always 
be remembered that the flesh of young animals does not keep 
fresh as long as that of older ones. Veal is divided in same 
manner as lamb, into fore and hind quarters. The fore- 
quarter is subdivided into breast, shoulder, and neck; the 
hind-quarter into loin, leg, and knuckle. Cutlets, fillets 
(cushion), and fricandeau are cut from the thick part of 
leg. 

Good veal may be known by its pinkish-colored flesh and 
white fat ; when the flesh lacks color, it has been taken from 
a creature which was too young to kill for food, or, if of the 
right age, was bled before killing. Veal may be obtained 
throughout the year, but is in season during the spring. 
Veal should be thoroughly cooked; being deficient in fat 
and having but little flavor, pork or butter should be added 
while cooking, and more seasoning is required than for 
other meats. 

Veal Cutlets 

Use slices of veal from leg cut one-half inch thick. Wipe, 
remove bone and skin, then cut in pieces for serving. The 
long, irregular-shaped pieces may be rolled, and fastened 
with small wooden skewers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; 



\ 



VEAL 227 

dip in flour, egg, and crumbs ; fry slowly, until well browned, 
in salt pork fat or butter ; then remove cutlets to stewpan 
and pour over one and one-half cups Brown Sauce. Place 
on back of range and cook slowly forty minutes, or until 
cutlets are tender* 

Veal may be cooked first in boiling water until tender, 
then crumbed and fried. The water in which veal was 
cooked may be used for sauce. Arrange on hot platter, 
strain sauce and pour around cutlets, and garnish with 
parsley. 

Brown Sauce. Brown three tablespoons butter, add three 
tablespoons flour, and stir until well browned. Add gradu- 
ally one and one-half cups stock or water, or half stock and 
half stewed aod strained tomatoes. Season with salt, pep- 
per, lemon juice, and Worcestershire Sauce. The trimmings 
from veal (including skin and bones) may be covered with 
one and one-half cups cold water, allowed to heat slowly to 
boiling-point, then cooked, strained, and used for sauce. 

Veal Chops Bavarian 

Wipe six loin chops and put in a stewpan with one-half 
onion, eight slices carrot, two stalks celery, one-half tea- 
spoon peppercorns, four cloves, and two tablespoons butter. 
Cover with boiling water and cook until tender. Drain, 
season with salt and pepper, dip in flour, egg, and crumbs, 
fry in deep fat, and drain on brown paper. Arrange chops 
on hot serving dish and surround with boiled flat maccaroni 
to which Soubise Sauce (see p. 267) is added.

CHAPTER XV 
SWEETBREADS 

A SWEETBREAD is the thymus gland of lamb or calf, 
but in cookery, veal sweetbreads only are consid- 
ered. It is prenatally developed, of unknown function, and 
as soon as calf is taken from liquid food it gradually dis- 
appears. Pancreas, stomach sweetbread, is sold in some 
sections of the country, but in our markets this custom is 
not practised. Sweetbreads are a reputed table delicacy, 
and a valuable addition to the menu of the convalescent. 

A sweetbread consists of two parts, connected by tubing 
and membranes. The round, compact part is called the 
heart sweetbread, as its position is nearer the heart; the 
other part is called the throat sweetbread. When sweet- 
bread is found in market separated, avoid buying two of 
the throat sweetbreads, as the heart sweetbread is more 
desirable. 

Sweetbreads spoil very quickly. They should be re- 
moved from paper as soon as received from market, 
plunged into cold water and allowed to stand one hour, 
drained, and put into acidulated salted boiling water 
then allowed to cook slowly twenty minutes ; again drained, 
and plunged into cold water, that they may be kept white 
and firm. Sweetbreads are always parboiled in this manner 
for subsequent cooking.

CHAPTER XVI 
POKE 

PORK is the flesh and fat of pig or hog. Different 
parts of the creature, when dressed, take different 
names. 

The chine and spareribs, which correspond to the loin in 
lamb and veal, are used for roasts or steaks. Two ribs are 
left on the chine. The hind lesrs furnish hams. These are 
cured, salted, and smoked. Sugar-cured hams are considered 
the best. Pickle, to which is added light brown sugar, 
molasses, and saltpetre, is introduced close to bone; hams 
are allowed to hang one week* then smoked with hickory 
wood. Shoulders are usually corned, or salted and smoked, 
though sometimes cooked fresh. Pigs* feez are boiled until 
tender, split, and covered with vinegar made from white 
wine. Hocks, the part just above the feet, are corned, and 
much used by Germans. Heads are soused, and cooked 
by boiling. The flank, which lies just below the ribs, is 
salted and smoked, and furnishes bacon. The best pieces of 
fat salt pork come from the back, on either side of backbone. 

Fat, when separated from flesh aud membrane, is tried 
oat and called lard. Leaf -lard is the best, and is tried out 
from the leaf shaped pieces of solid fat which lie inside the 
flank. Sausages are trimmings of !ean and fat meat, minced, 
highly seasoned, and forced into thin casings made of the 
prepared entrails. Little pigs (four weeks old) are some- 
times killed, dressed, and roasted whole. 

Pork contains the largest percentage of fat of any meat. 
When eaten fresh it is the most difficult of digestion, and 



236 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

although found in market through the entire year, it should 
be but seldom served, and then only during the winter months. 
By curing, salting, and smoking, pork is rendered more whole- 
some. Bacon, next to butter and cream, is the most easily 
assimilated of all fatty foods. 

Pork Chops 

Wipe chops, sprinkle with salt and pepper, place in a hot 
frying-pan, and cook slowly until tender, and well browned 
on each side. 

Pork Chops with Fried Apples 
Arrange Pork Chops on a platter, and surround with 
slices of apples, cut one-half inch thick, fried in the fat 
remaining in pan. 

Roast Pork 

Wipe pork, sprinkle with salt and pepper, place on a rack 
in a dripping-pan, and dredge meat and botton of pan with 
flour. Bake in a moderate oven three or four hours, basting 
every fifteen minutes with fat in pan. Make a gravy as for 
other roasts. 

Pork Tenderloins with Sweet Potatoes 

Wipe tenderloins, put in a dripping-pan, and brown quickly 
in a hot oven ; then sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bake

Broiled Ham 

Soak thin slices of ham one hour in lukewarm water. 
Drain, wipe, and broil three minutes. 

Fried Ham and Eggs 

Wipe ham, remove one-half outside layer of fat, and place 
in frying-pan. Cover with tepid water and let stand on back 
of range thirty minutes ; drain, and dry on a towel. Heat 
pan, put in ham, brown quickly on one side, turn and brown 
other side; or soak ham over night, dry, and cook in hot 
frying-pan. If cooked too long, ham will become hard and 
dry. Serve with fried eggs cooked in the tried-out ham 
fat. 

Barbecued Ham 

Soak thin slices of ham one hour in lukewarm water; 
drain, wipe, and cook in a hot frying-pan until slightly 
browned. Remove to serving dish and add to fat in pan 
three tablespoons vinegar mixed with one and one-half tea- 
spoons mustard, one-half teaspoon sugar, and one-eighth 
teaspoon paprika. When thoroughly heated pour over ham 
and serve at once. 

Boiled Ham 

Soak several hours or over night in cold water to cover. 
Wash thoroughly, trim off hard skin near end of bone, put 
in a kettle, cover with cold water, heat to boiling-point, and 
cook slowly until tender. See Time Table for Cooking, 
page 28. Remove kettle from range and set aside, that ham 
may partially cool ; then take from water, remove outside 
skin, sprinkle with sugar and fine cracker crumbs, and stick 
with cloves one-half inch apart. Bake one hour in a slow 
oven. Serve cold, thinly sliced. 

Roast Ham with Champagne Sauoe 

Place a whole baked ham in the oven fifteen minutes 
before serving time, that outside fat may be heated. Re- 
move to a hot platter, garnish bone end with a paper ruffle, 
and serve with Champagne Sauce.

Weatphalian Bam 

These hams are imported from Germany, and need no 
additional cooking. Cat in very thin slices for serving. 

Broiled Pigs' Feet 

Wipe, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and broil six to 
eight minutes. Serve with Maitre d'Hdtel Butter or Sauce 
Piquante. 

Fried Pigs 1 Feet 

Wipe, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip in crumbs, egg, 
and crumbs, fry in deep fat, and drain. 

Sausages 

Cut apart a string of sausages. Pierce each sausage 
several times with a carving fork. Put in frying-pan, cover 
with boiling water, and cook fifteen minutes ; drain, return 
to frying-pan, and fry until well browned. Serve with fried 
apples. Sausages are often broiled same as bacon and 
apples baked in pan under them. 

Boston Baked Beans 

Pick over one quart pea beans, cover with cold water, 
and soak over night. In morning, drain, cover with fresh 
water, heat slowly (keeping water below boiling-point), and 
cook until skins will burst, — which is best determined by 
taking a few beans on the tip of a spoon and blowing on 
them, when skins will burst if sufficiently cooked. Beans 
thus tested must, of course, be thrown away. Drain beans, 
throwing bean- water out of doors, not in sink. Scald rind of 
three-fourths pound fat salt pork, scrape, remove one-fourth 
inch slice and put in bottom of bean-pot. Cut through rind 
of remaining pork every one-half inch, making cuts one inch 
deep. Put beans in pot and bury pork in beans, leaving 
rind 3xposed. Mix one tablespoon salt, one tablespoon 
molasseo, and three tablespoons sugar; add one cup boiling 
water, and pour over beans ; then add enough more boiling 
water to cover beans. Cover bean-pot, put in oven, and 
bake slowly six or eight hours, uncovering the last hour of 



pork 289 

cooking, that rind may become brown and crisp. Add 
water as needed. Many feel sure that by adding with sea- 
sonings one-half tablespoon -mustard, the beans are more 
easily digested. If pork mixed with lean is preferred, use 
less salt. 

The fine reputation which Boston Baked Beans have 
gained has been attributed to the earthen bean-pot with 
small top and bulging sides in which they are supposed to 
be cooked. Equally good beans have often been eaten 
where a five-pound lard pail was substituted for the broken 
bean -pot. 

Yellow-eyed beans are very good when baked.

CHAPTER XVII 

POULTRY AND GAME 

POULTRY includes all domestic birds suitable for food 
except pigeon and squab. Examples: chicken, fowl, 
turkey, duck, goose, etc. Game includes such birds and 
animals suitable for food as are pursued and taken in field 
and forest. Examples : quail, partridge, wild duck, plover, 
deer, etc. 

The flesh of chicken, fowl, and turkey has much shorter 
fibre than that of ruminating animals, and is not inter- 
mingled with fat, — the fat always being found in layers 
directly under the skin, and surrounding the intestines. 
Chicken, fowl, and turkey are nutritious, and chicken is 
specially easy of digestion. The white meat found on breast 
and wing is more readily digested than the dark meat. The 
legs, on account of constant motion, are of a coarser fibre 
and darker color. 

Since incubators have been so much used for hatching 
chickens, small birds suitable for broiling may be always 
found in market. Chickens which appear in market during 
January weighing about one and one-half pounds are called 
spring chickens. 

Fowl is found in market throughout the year, but is at its 
best from March until June. 

Philadelphia, until recently, furnished our market with 
Philadelphia chickens and capons, but now Massachusetts 
furnishes equally good ones, which are found in market from 
December to June. They are very large, plump, and supe- 
rior eating. At an early age they are deprived of the organs 
of reproduction, penned, and specially fatted for killing. 



J 



POULTBY AND GAME 241 

They are recognized by the presence of head, tail, and wing 
feathers. 

Turkeys are found in market throughout the year, but are 
best during tbe winter months. Tame ducks and geese are 
very indigestible on account of the large quantity of fat 
they contain. Goose meat is thoroughly infiltrated with fat, 
containing sometimes forty to forty-five per cent. Pigeons, 
being old birds, need long, slow cooking to make them ten- 
der. Squabs (young pigeons) make a delicious tidbit for 
the convalescent, and are often the first meat allowed a 
patient by the physician. 

The flesh of game, with the exception of wild duck and 
wild geese, is tender, contains less fat than poultry, is of 
fine though strong flavor, and easy of digestion. Game 
meat is usually of dark color, partridge and quail being ex- 
ceptions, and is usually cooked rare. Venison, the flesh of 
deer, is short-fibred, dark-colored, highly savored, tender, 
and easy of digestion ; being highly savored, it often dis- 
agrees with those of weak digestion. 

Geese are in market throughout the year, Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island furnishing specially good ones. A goose 
twelve weeks old is known as a green goose. They may be 
found in market from May to September. Young geese 
which appear in market September first and continue through 
December are called goslings. They have been hatched 
during May and June, and then fatted for market. 

Toung ducks, found in market about March first, are 
called ducklings. Ganvasback Ducks have gained a fine 
reputation throughout the country, and are found in mar- 
ket from the last of November until March. Redhead 
Ducks are in season two weeks earlier, and are about as 
good eating as Canvasback Ducks, and much less in pf ice. 
The distinctive flavor of both is due to the wild celery on 
which they feed. Many other kinds of ducks are found in 
market during the fall and winter. Examples: Widgeon, 
Mallard, Lake Erie Teal, Black Ducks, and Butterballs. 

Fresh quail are in market from October fifteenth to Janu- 
ary first, the law forbidding their being killed at any other 
time in the year. The same is true of partridge, but both 



242 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

are frozen and kept in cold storage several months. Cali- 
fornia sends frozen quail in large numbers to Eastern mar- 
kets. Grouse (prairie chicken) are always obtainable, — 
fresh ones in the fall; later, those kept in cold storage. 
Plover may be bought from April until December. 

To Seleot Poultry and Game. A chicken is known by 
soft feet, smooth skin, and soft cartilage at end of breast- 
bone. An abundance of pinfeatbers always indicates a 
young bird, while the presence of long hairs denotes age. la 
a fowl the feet have become hard and dry with coarse scales, 
and cartilage at end of breastbone has ossified. Cock turkeys 
are usually better eating than hen turkeys, unless hen turkey 
is young, small, and plump. A good turkey should be 
plump, have smooth dark legs, and cartilage at end of breast- 
bone soft and pliable. Good geese abound in pin feathers. 
Small birds should be plump, have soft feet and pliable bills. 

To Dress and Clean Poultry. Remove hairs and down 
by holding the bird over a flame (from gas, alcohol, or burn- 
ing paper) and constantly changing position until all parts 
of surface have been exposed to flame; this is known as 
singeing. Cut off the head and draw out pinfeathers, using 
a small pointed knife. Cut through the skin around the leg 
one and one-half inches below the leg joint, care being taken 
not to cut tendons ; place leg at this out over edge of board, 
press downward to snap the bone, then take foot in right 
hand, holding bird firmly in left hand, and pull off foot, and 
with it the tendons. In old birds the tendons must be drawn 
separately, which is best accomplished by using a steel 
skewer. Make an incision through skin below breastbone, 
just large enough to admit the hand. With the hand remove 
entrails, gizzard, heart, and liver ; the last three named con- 
stitute what is known as giblets. The gall bladder, lying on 
the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, is removed 
with liver, and great care must be taken that it is not broken, 
as a small quantity of the bile which it contains would im- 
part a bitter flavor to the parts with which it came in contact 
Enclosed by the ribs, on either side of backbone, may be 
found the lungs, of spongy consistency and red color. Care 
must be taken that every part of them is removed. Kidneys, 



POULTRY AND GAME 248 

lying in the hollow near end of backbone, must also be re- 
moved. By introducing first two fingers under skin close to 
neck, the windpipe may be easily found and withdrawn ; also 
the crop, which will he found adhering to skin close to breast 
Draw down neck skin, and cut off neck close to body, leav- 
ing skin long enough to fasten under the back. Remove oil 
bag, and wash bird by allowing cold water to run through it, 
not allowing bird to soak in cold water. Wipe inside and 
outside, looking carefully to see that everything has been 
withdrawn. If there is disagreeable odor, suggesting that 
fowl may have been kept too long, clean at once, wash inside 
and out with soda water, and sprinkle inside with charcoal 
and place some under wings. 

Poultry dressed at market seldom have tendons removed 
unless so ordered. It is always desirable to have them with- 
drawn, as they become hard and bony during cooking. It is 
the practice of market- men to cut a gash through the skin, 
to easier reach crop and windpipe. This gash must be sewed 
before stuffing, and causes the bird to look less attractive 
when cooked. 

To Cut up a Fowl. Singe, draw out pinfeathers, cut off 
head, remove tendons and oil bag. Cut through skin be- 
tween leg and body close to body, bend back leg (thus break- 
ing ligaments), cut through flesh, and separate at joint. 
Separate the upper part of leg, second joint, from lower part 
of leg, drumstick, as leg is separated from body. Remove 
wing by cutting through skin and flesh around upper wing 
joint which lies next to body, then disjoint from body. Cuu 
off tip of wing and separate wing at middle joint. Remove 
leg and wing from other side. Separate breast from back 
by cutting through skin, beginning two inches below breast- 
bone and passing knife between terminus of small ribs on 
either side and extending cut to collar-bone. Before removing 
entrails, gizzard, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, crop, and wind- 
pipe, observe their position, that the anatomy of the bird may 
be understood. The back is sometimes divided by cutting 
through the middle crosswise. The wishbone, with adjoin- 
ing meat, is frequently removed, and the breast meat may 
be separated in two parts by cutting through flesh close to 



244 BOSTON OOOKJNG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

breastbone with cleaver. Wipe pieces, excepting back, with 
cheese-cloth wrung out of cold water. Back piece needs thor- 
ough washing. • 

To Clean GHblets. Remove thin membrane, arteries, veins, 
and clotted blood around heart. Separate gall bladder from 
liver, cutting off any of liver that may have a greenish tinge. 
Cut fat and membranes from gizzard. Make a gash through 
thickest part of gizzard, and cut as far as inner lining, being 
careful not to pierce it Remove the inner sack and discard. 
Wash giblets and cook until tender, with neck and tips of 
wings, putting them in cold water and heating water quickly 
that some of the flavor may be drawn out into stock, which 
is to be used for making gravy. 

To Stuff Poultry. Put stuffing by spoonfuls in neck end, 
using enough to sufficiently fill the skin, that bird may look 
plump when served. Where cracker stuffing is used, allow- 
ance must be made for the swelling of crackers, otherwise 
skin may burst during cooking. Put remaining staffing in 
body; if the body is full, sew skin; if not full, bring skin 
together with a skewer. 

To Truss Fowl. Draw thighs close to body and hold by 
inserting a steel skewer under middle joint running it 
through body, coming out under middle joint on other side. 
Cut piece three-fourths inch wide from neck skin, and with 
it fasten legs together at ends; or cross drumsticks, tie 
securely with a long striug, and fasten to tail. Place wings 
close to body and hold them by inserting a second skewer 
through wing, body, and wing on opposite side. Draw neck 
skin under back and fasten with a small wooden skewer. 
Turn bird on its breast. Cross string attached to tail piece 
and draw it around each end of lower skewer ; again cross 
string and draw around each end of upper skewer ; fasten 
string in a knot and cut off ends. In birds that are not 
stuffed legs are often passed through incisions cut in body 
under bones near tail. 

To Dress Birds for Broiling. Singe, wipe, and with a 
sharp-pointed knife, beginning at back of neck, make a cat 
through backbone the entire length of bird. Lay open the 
bird and remove contents from inside. Cut out rib bonee 




POULTRY AND GAME 245 

on either side of backbone, remove from breastbone, then 
cut through tendons at joints. 

To Fillet a Chicken. Remove skin from breast, and with 
a small sharp knife begin at end of collar-bone and cut 
through flesh, following close to wish and breast bones the 
entire length of meat. Raise flesh with fingers, and with 
knife free the piece of meat from bones which lie under it. 
Cut meat away from wing joint ; this solid piece of breast is 
meat known as a JUlet. This meat is easily separated in two 
parts. The upper, larger part is called the large fillet ; the 
lower part the mignon fillet. The tough skin on the outside 
of large fillet should be removed, also the sinew from mignon 
fillet. To remove tough skin, place large fillet on a board, 
upper side down, make an incision through flesh at top of 
fillet, and cut entire length of fillet, holding knife as close to 
skin as possible. Trim edges, that fillet may look shapely. 

Broiled Chicken 

Dress for broiling, following directions on page 244. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and place in a well-greased 
broiler. Broil twenty minutes over a clear fire, watching 
carefully and turning broiler so that all parts may be equally 
browned. The flesh side must be exposed to the fire the 
greater part of time, as the skin side will brown quickly. 
Remove to a hot platter, spread with soft butter, and 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Chickens are so apt to burn 
while broiling that many prefer to partially cook in oven. 
Place chicken in dripping-pan, skin side down, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, dot over with butter, and bake fifteen min- 
utes in hot oven; then broil to finish cooking. Guinea 
chickens are becoming popular cooked in this way. 

Boiled Fowl 

Dress, clean, and truss a four-pound fowl, tie in cheese- 
cloth, place on trivet in a kettle, half surround with boiling 
water, cover, and cook slowly until tender, turning occa- 
sionally. Add salt the last hour of cooking. Serve with 
Egg, Oyster, or Celery Sauce. It is not desirable to stuff 
a boiled fowl.

Chicken a la Providence 

Prepare and boil a chicken, following recipe for Boiled 
Fowl. The liquor should be reduced to two cups, and used 
for making sauce, with two tablespoons each butter and floor 
cooked together. Add to sauce one-half cup each of cooked 
carrot (cut in fancy shapes) and green peas, one teaspoon 
lemon juice, yolks two eggs, salt and pepper. Place chicken 
on hot platter, surround with sauce, and sprinkle chicken 
and sauce with one-half tablespoon finely chopped parsley. 

Stewed Chicken with Onions 

Dress, clean, and cut in pieces for serving, two chickens. 
Cook in a small quantity of water with eighteen tiny young 
onions. Remove chicken to serving-dish as soon as tender, 
and when onions are soft drain from stock and reduce stock 
to one and one-half cups. Make sauce of three tablespoons 
butter, four tablespoons flour, stock, and one-half cup heavy 
cream ; then add yolks three eggs, salt, pepper, and lemon 
juice to taste. Pour sauce over chicken and onions. 

Chicken a la Stanley 

Melt one-fourth cup butter, add one large onion thinly 
sliced, and two broilers cut in pieces for serving; cover, 
and cook slowly ten minutes ; then add one cup Chicken 
Stock, and cook until meat is tender. Remove chickens, 
rub stock and onions through a sieve, and add one and one- 
half tablespoons each butter and flour cooked together. Add 
cream to make sauce of the right consistency. Season with 
salt and pepper. Arrange chicken on serving dish, poor 
around sauce, and garnish dish with bananas cut in diagonal 
slices dipped in flour and sauted in butter. 

Chili Con Carni 

Clean, singe, and cut in pieces for serving, two young 
chickens. Season with salt and pepper, find saut£ in butter. 



POULTRY AND GAME 247 

Remove seeds and veins from eight red peppers, cover with 
boiling water, and cook until soft ; mash, and rub through a 
sieve. Add one teaspoon salt, one onion finely chopped, 
two cloves of garlic finely chopped, the chicken, and boiling 
water to cover. Cook until chicken is tender. Remove to 
serving dish, and thicken sauce with three tablespoons each 
butter and flour cooked together ; there should be one and 
one-half cups sauce. Canned pimentoes may be used in 
place of red peppers. 

Roast Chicken 

Dress, clean, stuff, and truss a chicken. Place on its back 
on rack in a dripping pan. rub entire surface with salt, and 
spread breast and legs with three tablespoons butter, rubbed 
until creamy and mixed with two tablespoons flour. Dredge 
bottom of pan with flour. Place in a hot oven, and when 
flour is well browned, reduce the heat, then baste. Continue 
basting every ten minutes until chicken is cooked. For 
basting, use one-fourth cup butter, melted in two-thirds cup 
boiling water, and after this is gone, use fat in pan, and 
when necessary to prevent flour burning, add one cup boiling 
water. During cooking, turn chicken frequently, that it 
may brown evenly. If a thick crust is desired, dredge bird 
with flour two or three times during cooking. If a glazed 
surface is preferred, spread bird with butter, omitting flour, 
and do not dredge during baking. When breast meat is 
tender, bird is sufficiently cooked. A four-pound chicken 
requires about one and one-half hours.

or make a sauce by browning butter and flour and adding 
two cups stock, then seasoning with salt and pepper. 

Fowls, which are always made tender by long cooking, 
are frequently utilized in this way. If chickens are em- 
ployed, they are sauted without previous boiling, and al- 
lowed to simmer fifteen to twenty minutes in the sauce. 

Fried Chicken

and wings with one-third cup butter, rubbed until creamy 
and mixed with one-fourth cup flour. Dredge bottom of pan 
with flour. Place in a hot oven, and when flour on turkey 
begins to brown, reduce heat, and baste every fifteen minutes 
until turkey is cooked, which will require about three hours. 
For basting use one- half cup butter melted in one- half cup 
boiling water and after this is used baste with fat in pan. 
Pour water in pan during the cooking as needed to prevent 
flour from burning. During cooking turn turkey frequently, 
that it may brown evenly. If turkey is browning too fast, 
cover with buttered paper to prevent burning. Remove 
string aud skewers before serving. Garnish with parsley, 
or celery tips, or curled celery and rings and discs of carrots 
strung on fine wire.

FISH AND MEAT SAUCES 265 



CHAPTER XVIII 
FISH AND MEAT SAUCES 

THE French chef keeps always on hand four sauces, — 
White, Brown, Bechamel, and Tomato, — and with 
these as a basis is able to make kinds innumerable. Butter 
and flour are usually cooked together for thickening sauces. 
When not browned, it is called roux; when browned, brown 
roux. The French mix butter and flour together, put in 
saucepan, place over fire, stir for five minutes ; set aside to 
cool, again place over fire, and add liquid, stirring constantly 
until thick and smooth. Butter and flour for brown sauces 
are cooked together much longer, and watched carefully lest 
butter should burn. The American cook makes sauce by 
stirring butter in saucepan until melted and bubbling, adds 
flour and continues stirring, then adds liquid, gradually stir- 
ring or beating until the boiling-point is reached. For Brown 
Sauce, butter should be stirred until well browned; flour 
should be added and stirred with butter until both are 
browned before the addition of liquid. The secret in mak- 
ing a Brown Sauce is to have butter and flour well browned 
before adding liquid. 

It is well worth remembering that a sauce of average 
thickness is made by allowing two tablespoons each of butter 
and flour to one cup liquid, whether it be milk, stock, or to- 
mato. For Brown Sauce a slightly larger quantity of flour 
is necessary, as by browning flour its thickening property is 
lessened, its starch being changed to dextrine. When sauces 
are set away, put a few bits of butter on top to prevent crust 
from forming.

W. 0. Atwater, Ph.D. 



Vegetables include, commonly though not botanically 
speaking, all plants used for food except grains and fruits. 
With exception of beans, peas, and lentils, which contain a e^L 



VEGETABLES 281 

large amount of proteid, they are chiefly valuable for their 
potash salts, and should form a part of each day's dietary. 
Many contain much cellulose, which gives needed bulk to 
the food. The legumes, peas, beans, and lentils may be 
used in place of flesh food. 

For the various vegetables different parts of the plant are 
used. Some are eaten in the natural state, others are 
cooked. 

Tubers White potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes 

~_, | Beets, carrots, parsnips, radishes, sweet potatoes, 

\ salsify or oyster plant, and turnips 
Bulbs Garlic, onions, and shallots 
Stems Asparagus, celery, and chives 
_ f Brussels sprouts, beet greens, cabbages, dandelions, 

ave8 \ lettuce, sorrel, spinach, aud watercress 
Flowers Cauliflower 

_ . f Beans, corn, cucumbers, okra, egg-plant, peas, lentils, 
\ squash, and tomatoes. 

Young, tender vegetables, — as lettuce, radishes, cucum- 
bers, water-cress, and tomatoes, — eaten uncooked, served 
separately or combined in salads, help to stimulate a flag- 
ging appetite, and when dressed with oil furnish considerable 
nutriment. 

Beans, and peas when old, should be employed in mak- 
ing purees and soups; by so doing, the outer covering of 
cellulose, so irritating to the stomach, is removed. 

Care of Vegetables 

Summer vegetables should be cooked as soon after gather- 
ing as possible; in case they must be kept, spread on 
bottom of cool, dry, well-ventilated cellar, or place in ice- 
box. Lettuce may be best kept by sprinkling with cold 
water and placing in a tin pail closely covered. Wilted 
vegetables may be freshened by allowing to stand in cold 
water. Vegetables which contain sugar lose some of their 
sweetness by standing; corn and peas are more quickly 
affected than others. Winter vegetables should be kept in 
a cold, dry place. Beets, carrots, turnips, potatoes, etc., 



282 BOSTON COOKING-SOHOOL COOK BOOK 

should be pat in barrels or piled in bins, to exclude as much 
air as possible. Squash should be spread, and needs care* 
f ul watching ; when dark spots appear, cook at once. 

In using canned goods, empty contents from can as soon 
as opened, lest the acid therein act on the tin to produce 
poisonous compounds, and let stand one hour, that it may 
become reoxygenated. Beans, peas, asparagus, etc., should 
be emptied into a strainer, drained, and cold water poured 
over them and allowed to run through. In using dried 
vegetables, soak in cold water several hours before cooking. 
A few years ago native vegetables were alone sold ; but 
now our markets are largely supplied from the Southern 
States and California, thus allowing us fresh vegetables 
throughout the year. 

Cooking of Vegetables 

A small scrubbing-brush, which may be bought for five 
cents, and two small pointed knives for preparing vegetables 
should be found in every kitchen. 

Vegetables should be washed in cold water, and cooked 
until soft in boiling salted water ; if cooked in an uncovered 
vessel, their color is better kept. For peas and beans add 
salt to water last half hour of cooking. Time for cooking 
the same vegetable varies according to freshness and age, 
therefore time-tables for cooking serve only as guides. 

Mushrooms and Truffles 

These are classed among vegetables. Mushrooms, which 
grow about us abundautly, may be easily gathered, and as 
they contain considerable nutriment, should often be found 
on the table. While there are hundreds of varieties, one by 
a little study may acquaint herself with a dozen or more of 
the most common ones which are valuable as food. Consult 
W. Hamilton Gibson, " Our Edible Toadstools and Mash- 
rooms." Many might cause illness, but only a few varieties 
of the Amanita family are deadly poison. Mushrooms 
require heat and moisture, — a severe drought or very wet 
soil being unfavorable for their growth. Never gather 
mushrooms in the vicinity of decaying matter. They appear 



VEGETABLES 288 

the middle of May, and last until frost comes. Campestris 
is the variety always found in market; French canned are 
of this family. Boleti are dried, canned, and sold as cepes. 

Truffles 

Truffles belong to the same family as mushrooms, and 
are grown underground. France is the most famous field 
for their production, from which country they are exported 
in tin cans, and are too expensive for ordinary use. 

Artichokes 

French artichokes, imported throughout the year, are the 
ones principally used. They retail from thirty to forty 
cents each, and are cheapest and best in November, Decem- 
ber, and January. Artichokes are appearing in market from 
California and are somewhat cheaper in price than the 
French Artichoke. Jerusalem artichokes are employed for 
pickling, and can be bought for fifteen cents per quart. 

Boiled Artichokes 

Cut off stem close to leaves, remove outside bottom 
leaves, trim artichoke, cut off one inch from top of leaves, 
and with a sharp knife remove choke; then tie artichoke 
with a string to keep its shape. Soak one-half hour in 
cold water. Drain, and cook thirty to forty-five minutes 
in boiling, salted, acidulated water. Remove from water, 
place upside down to drain, then take off string. Serve 
with Bechamel or Hollandaise Sauce. Boiled Artichokes 
often constitute a course at dinner. Leaves are drawn 
out separately with fingers, dipped in sauce, and fleshy ends 
only eaten, although the bottom is edible. Artichokes may 
be cut in quarters, cooked, drained, and served with Sauce 
Bearnaise. When prepared in this way they are served with 
mutton. 

Fried Artichokes 

Sprinkle Boiled Artichokes cut in quarters with salt, 
pepper, and finely chopped parsley. Dip in Batter I, fry in 
deep fat, and drain. In preparing artichokes, trim off tops 
of leaves closer than when served as Boiled Artichokes.

Artiohoke Bottoms 

Remove all leaves and the choke. Trim bottoms in 
shape, and cook until soft in boiling, salted, acidulated 
water. Serve with Hollandaise or Bechamel Sauce. 

Stuffed Artichokes 

Prepare and cook as Boiled Artichokes, having them 
slightly underdone. Fill with Chicken Force-meat I or 
II, and bake thirty minutes in a moderate oven, basting 
twice with Thin White Sauce. Remove to serving dish and 
pour around Thin White Sauce. 

Asparagus 

Hothouse asparagus is found in market during winter, 
but is not very satisfactory, and is sold for about one 
dollar per bunch. Oyster Bay (white asparagus) appears 
first of May, and commands a very high price. Large and 
small green stalk asparagus is in season from first of June 
to middle of July, and cheapest the middle of June. 

Boiled Asparagus 

Cut off lower parts of stalks as far down as they will 
snap, untie bunches, wash, remove scales, and retie. Cook 
in boiling salted water fifteen minutes or until soft, leaving 
tips out of water first ten minutes. Drain, remove string, 
and spread with soft butter, allowing one and one-half 
tablespoons butter to each bunch asparagus. Asparagus is 
often broken or cut in inch pieces for boiling, cooking tips a 
shorter time than stalks. 

Asparagus on Toast 
Serve Boiled Asparagus on Buttered or Milk Toast. . 

Asparagus in White Sauce 

Boil asparagus cut in one-inch pieces, drain, and add 
to White Sauce I, allowing one cup sauce to each bunch 
asparagus. Serve in Croustades of Bread for a vegetable 
course.

Asparagus in Crusts 

Remove centres from small rolls, fry shells in deep fat, 
drain, and fill with Asparagus in White Sauce. 

Beans 

String Beans that are obtainable in winter come from 
California; natives appear in market the last of June and 
continue until the last of September. There are two varie- 
ties, green (pole cranberry being best flavored) and yellow 
(butter bean). 

Shell Beans, including horticultural and sieva, are sold in 
the pod or shelled, five quarts in pod making one quart 
shelled. They are found in market during July and August. 
Common lima and improved lima shell beans are in season 
in August and September. Dried lima beans are procurable 
throughout the year. 

String Beans 

Remove strings, and snap or cut in one-inch pieces ; wash, 
and cook in boiling water from one to three hours, adding 
salt last half-hour of cooking. Drain, season with butter 
and salt 

Shall Beans 

Wash, and cook in boiling water from one to one and a 
half hours, adding salt last half-hour of cooking. Cook in 
sufficiently small quantity of water, that there may be 
none left to drain off when beans are cooked. Season 
with butter and salt. 

Cream of Lima Beans 

Soak one cup dried beans over night, drain, and cook 
in boiling salted water until soft; drain, add three-fourths 
cup cream, and season with butter and salt. Reheat before 
serving. 



286 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Boiled Beets 

Wash, and cook whole in boiling water until soft; time 
required being from one to four hours. Old beets will never 
be tender, no matter how long they may be cooked. Drain, 
and put in cold water that skins may be easily removed. 
Serve cut in quarters or slices. 

Sugared Beets 

4 hot boiled beets \% tablespoons sugar 

3 tablespoons butter % teaspoon salt

Drain, and reserve one-half cup water in which beets were 
cooked. Plunge into cold water, rub off skins and cut into 
cubes. Reheat in 

Sour Sauoe. Melt two tablespoons butter, add two table- 
spoons flour, and pour on the beet water. Add one-fourth 
cup, each, vinegar and cream, one teaspoon sugar, one-half 
teaspoon salt, and a few grains pepper. 

Harvard Beets 

Wash twelve small beets, cook in boiling water until soft, 
remove skins, and cut beets in thin slices, small cubes, or 
fancy shapes, using French vegetable cutter. Mix one-half 
cup sugar and one-half tablespoon corn-starch. Add one- 
half cup vinegar and let boil five minutes. Pour over beets, 
and let stand on back of range one half hour. Just before 
serving add two tablespoons butter. 

Brussels Sprouts 

Brussels sprouts belong to the same family as cabbage, 
and the small heads grow from one to two inches apart.

quarts. They are imported, and also grow in this country, 
being cheapest and best in December and January. 

Brussels Sprouts in White Banco 

Pick over, remove wilted leaves, and soak in, cold water 
fifteen minutes. Cook in boiling salted water twenty min- 
utes, or until easily pierced with a skewer* Drain, and to 
each pint add one cup White Sauce I. 

Scalloped Brussels Sprouts 

Pick over, remove wilted leaves, and soak in cold water 
one quart sprouts. Cook in boiling salted water uutil soft, 
then drain. "Wash celery and cut in pieces ; there should be 
one and one-half cups. Melt three tablespoons butter, add 
celery, cook two minutes, add three tablespoons flour, and 
pour on gradually one and one-half cups scalded milk ; add 
sprouts and turn mixture into a baking-dish. Cover with 
buttered crumbs and bake in a hot oven until crumbs are 
brown. 

Cabbage 

There are four kinds of cabbage in the market, — drum- 
head, sugar-loaf, Savoy, and purple ; and some variety may 
be found throughout the year. The Savoy is best for boil- 
ing; drum-head and purple for Cole-Slaw. In buying, 
select heavy cabbages. 

Boiled Cabbage 

Take off outside leaves, cut in quarters, and remove 
tough stalk. Soak in cold water and cook in an uncovered 
vessel in boiling salted water, to which is added one-fourth 
teaspoon soda ; this prevents disagreeable odor during cook- 
ing. Cook from thirty minutes to one hour, drain, and serve ; 
or chop, and season with butter, salt, and pepper. 

Escalloped Cabbage

German Cabbage 

Slice red cabbage and soak in cold water. Put one quart 
in stewpan with two tablespoons butter, one-half teaspoon 
salt, one tablespoon finely chopped onion, few gratings of 
nutmeg, and few grains cayenne; cover, and cook until 
cabbage is tender. Add two tablespoons vinegar and one- 
half tablespoon sugar, and cook five minutes. 

Cole-Slaw 

Select a small, heavy cabbage, take off outside leaves, 
and cut in quarters; with a sharp knife slice very thinly. 
Soak in cold water until crisp, drain, dry between towels, 
and mix with Cream Salad Dressing. 

Hot Blaw 

Slice cabbage as for Cole-Slaw, using one-half cabbage. 
Heat in a dressing made of yolks of two eggs slightly 
beaten, one-fourth cup cold water, one tablespoon butter, 
one-fourth cup hot vinegar, and one-half teaspoon salt, 
stirred over hot water until thickened. 

Carrots 

Carrots may always be found in market. New carrots 
appear last of April, and are sold in bunches ; these may be 
boiled and served, but carrots are chiefly used for flavoring 
soups, and for garnishing, on account of their bright color. 
To prepare carrots for cooking, wash and scrape, as best 
flavor and brightest color are near the skin. 

Carrots and Peas 

Wash, scrape, and cut young carrots in small cubes or 
fancy shapes; cook until soft in boiling salted water or 
stock. Drain, add an equal quantity of cooked green peas, 
and season with butter, salt, and pepper. 

Carrots, Poulette Sauce 

Wash, scrape, and cut carrots in strips, cubes, or fancy

drain, and cook in boiling salted water, to which is added 
one-half tablespoon butter, until soft. Add to recipe for 
sauce given under Mac£doine of Vegetables a la Poulette 
(see p. 308). 

Cauliflower 

Cauliflowers comprise the stalks and flowerets of a plant 
which belongs to the same family as Brussels sprouts and 
cabbage ; they may be obtained throughout the year, but are 
cheapest and best in September and October. In selecting 
cauliflowers, choose those with white heads and fresh green 
leaves ; if dark spots are on the heads, they are not fresh. 

Creamed Cauliflower 

Remove leaves, cut off stalk, and soak thirty minutes (head 
down) in cold water to cover. Cook (head up) twenty min- 
utes or until soft in boiling salted water; drain, separate 
flowerets, and reheat in one and one-half cups White 
Sauce I. 

Cauliflower a la Hollandaiae 

Prepare as for Creamed Cauliflower, using Hollandaise 
Sauce I instead of White Sauce.

one-fourth teaspoon paprika. Add yolks three eggs slightly 
beaten, one-fourth cup olive oil, and one-half cup vinegar in 
which one-half teaspoon finely chopped shallot has infused 
five minutes. Cook over hot water until mixture thickens. 
Remove from range, and add one-half tablespoon curry pow- 
der, two tablespoons melted butter, and one teaspoon finely 
chopped parsley. 

Celery 

Celery may be obtained from last of July until April. It 
is best and cheapest in December. Celery stalks are green 
while growing ; but the white celery seen in market has been 
bleached, with the exception of Kalamazoo variety, which 
grows white. To prepare celery for table, cut off roots and 
leaves, separate stalks, wash, scrape, and chill in ice-water. 
By adding a slice of lemon to ice-water celery is kept white 
and made crisp. If tops of stalks are gashed several times 
before putting in water, they will curl back and make celery 
look more attractive. 

Celery in White Sauce 

Wash, scrape, and cut celery stalks in one-inch pieces; 
cook twenty minutes or until soft in boiling salted water; 
drain, and to two cups celery add one cup White Sauce I. 
This is a most satisfactory way of using the outer stalks of 
celery. 

Fried Celery, Tomato Sauce 

Wash and scrape celery, cut in three-inch pieces, dip in 
batter, fry in deep fat, and drain on brown paper. Serve 
with Tomato Sauce. 

Batter. Mix one-half cup bread flour, one-fourth tea- 
spoon salt, a few grains pepper, one-third cup milk, and one 
egg well beaten. 

Chicoory or Endive 

Chiccory or endive may be obtained throughout the year, 
but during January, February, March, and April supply is 
imported. It is used only for salads. 



VEGETABLES 291 

Corn 

Corn may be found in market from first of Jnne to first 
of October. Until native corn appears it is the most unsatis- 
factory vegetable. Native com is obtainable the last of 
July, but is most abundant and cheapest in August. Among 
the best varieties are Crosby for early corn and Evergreen 
for late corn. 

Boiled Green Corn 

Remove husks and silky threads. Cook ten to twenty 
minutes in boiling water. Place on platter covered with

then surrounded by meat. 

Baked Chestnuts 

Remove shells from one pint chestnuts, put in a baking- 
dish, cover with Chicken Stock highly seasoned with salt and 
cayenne, and bake until soft, keeping covered until nearly 
done. There should be a small quantity of stock in pan to 
serve with chestnuts. 

Cucumbers 

Cucumbers may be obtained throughout the year, and are 
generally served raw. During the latter part of the summer 
they are gathered and pickled for subsequent use. Small 
pickled cucumbers are called gherkins. 

Sliced Cucumbers 

Remove thick slices from both ends and cut off a thick 
paring, as the cucumber contains a bitter principle, a large 
quantity of which lies near the skin and stem end. Cut 
in thin slices and keep in cold water until ready to serve. 
Drain, and cover with crushed ice for serving.

or until tender in boiling salted water. Allow two quarts 
water to one peck dandelions. Season with butter, salt, 
and pepper. Serve with vinegar. 

Ifettnce 

Lettuce is obtainable all the year, and is especially 
valuable during the winter and spring, when other green 
vegetables in market command a high price. Although 
containing but little nutriment, it is useful for the large 
quantity of water and potash salts that it contains, and 
assists in stimulating the appetite. Curly lettuce is of less 
value than Tennis Ball, but makes an effective garnish. 

Lettuce should be separated by removing leaves from 
stalk (discarding wilted outer leaves), washed, kept in cold 
water until crisp, drained, and so placed on a towel that 
water may drop from leaves. A bag made from white 
mosquito netting is useful for drying lettuce. Wash lettuce

leaves, place in bag, and hang in lower part of ice-box to 
drain. Wire baskets are used for the same purpose. Ar- 
range lettuce for serving in nearly its original shape. 

Leeks on Toast 

Wash and trim leeks, cook in boiling salted water until 
soft, and drain. Arrange on pieces of buttered toast and 
pour over melted butter, seasoned with salt and pepper. 

Onions 

The onion belongs to the same family (Lily) as do shaMot^ 
garlic^ leek, and cliive. Onions are cooked and served as a 
vegetable. They are wholesome, and contain considerable 
nutriment, but are objectionable on acccount of the strong 
odor they impart to the breath, due to volatile substances 
absorbed by the blood, and by the blood carried to the 
lungs, where they are set. free. The common garden onion 
is obtainable throughout the year, the new ones appearing 
in market about the first of June. In large centres Bermuda 
and Spanish onions are procurable from March 1st to June 
1st, and are of delicate flavor. 

Shallot, leek, garlic, and chive are principally used to 
give additional flavor to food. Shallot, garlic, and chive 
are used, to some extent, in making salads. 

Boiled Onions 

Put onions in cold water and remove skins while under 
water. Drain, put in a saucepan, and cover with boiling 
salted water; boil five minutes, drain, and again cover with 
boiling salted water. Cook one hour or until soft, but not 
broken. Drain, add a small quantity of milk, cook five 
minutes, and season with butter, salt, and pepper.

buttered baking-dish, add highly seasoned brown stock to 
cover bottom of dish, sprinkle with sugar, and bake until 
soft, basting with stock in pan. 

Fried Onions 

Remove skins from four medium-sized onions. Cut in 
thin slices and put in a hot omelet pan with one and one-half 
tablespoons butter. Cook until brown, occasionally shaking 
pan that onions may not burn, or turn onions, using a fork. 
Sprinkle with salt one minute before taking from fire. 

French Fried Onions 

Peel onions, cut in one-fourth inch slices, and separate 
into rings. Dip in milk, drain, and dip in flour. Fry in 
deep fat, drain on brown paper, and sprinkle with salt 

Staffed Onions 

Remove skins from onions, and parboil ten minutes in 
boiling salted water to cover. Turn upside down to cool, 
and remove part of centres. Fill cavities with equal parts 
of finely chopped cooked chicken, stale Loft bread crumbs, 
and finely chopped onion which was removed, seasoned with 
salt and pepper, and moistened with cream or melted butter. 
Place in buttered shallow baking-pan, sprinkle with buttered 
crumbs, and bake in a moderate oven until onions are soft. 

Creamed Oyster Plant (Salsify) 

Wash, scrape, and put at once into cold acidulated water 
to prevent discoloration. Cut in inch slices, cook in boiling 
salted water until soft, drain, and add to White Sauce I. 
Oyster plant is in season from October to March. 

Salsify Fritters 

Cook oyster plant as for Creamed Oyster Plant. Mash, 
season with butter, salt, and pepper. Shape in small flat 
cakes, roll in flour, and saute in butter. 



VEGETABLES 297 

Parsnips 

Parsnips are not so commonly served as other vegetables ; 
however, they often accompany a boiled dinner. They are 
raised mostly for feeding cattle. Unless young they con- 
tain a large amount of woody fibre, which extends through 
centre of roots and makes them undesirable as food. 

Parsnips with Drawn Butter Sauce 

Wash and scrape parsnips, and cut in pieces two inches 
long and one-half inch wide and thick. Cook five minutes 
in boiling salted water, or until soft. Drain, and to two 
cups add one cup Drawn Butter Sauce. 

Parsnip Fritters 

Wash parsnips and cook forty- five minutes in boiling 
8 al ted water. Drain, plunge into cold water, when skins 
will be found to slip off easily. Mash, season with butter, 
salt, and pepper, shape in small flat round cakes, roll in flour, 
and saute* in butter. 



Peas contain, next to beans, the largest percentage of 
proteid of any of the vegetables, and when young are easy 
of digestion. They appear in market as early as April, 
coming from Florida and California, and although high 
in price are hardly worth buying, having been picked so 
long. Native peas may be obtained the middle of June, 
and last until the first of September. The early June are 
small peas, contained in a small pod. McLean, the best 
peas, are small peas in large fiat pods. Champion peas are 
large, and the pods are well filled, but they lack sweetness. 
Marrowfat peas are the largest in the market, and are 
usually sweet 

Boiled Peas 

Remove peas from pods, cover with cold water, and let 
stand one-half hour. Skim off undeveloped peas which rise 
to top of water, and drain remaining peas. Cook until soft 
in a small quantity of boiling water, adding salt the last fif- 



298 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

teen minutes of cooking. (Consult Time Table for Cooking, 
p. 28). There should be but little, if any, water to drain 
from peas when they are cooked. Season with butter, salt, 
and pepper. If peas have lost much of their natural sweet- 
ness, they are improved by the addition of a small amount 
of sugar. 

Creamed Peas 

Drain Boiled Peas, and to two cups peas add three-fourths 
cup White Sauce II. Canned peas are often drained, rinsed, 
and reheated in this way. 

Pea Timbales 

Drain and rinse one can peas, and rub through a sieve. 
To one cup pea pulp add two beaten eggs, two tablespoons 
melted butter, two-thirds teaspoon salt, one-eighth teaspoon 
pepper, few grains cayenne, and few drops onion juice. 
Turn into buttered moulds, set in pan of hot water, cover 
with buttered paper, and bake until firm. Serve with one 
cup white sauce to which is added one-third cup canned peas 
drained and rinsed.

Pumpkins 

Pumpkins are boiled or steamed same as squash, but re- 
quire longer cooking. They are principally used for making 
pies. 

Radishes 

Radishes may be obtained throughout the year. There 
are round and long varieties, the small round ones being 
considered best. They are bought in bunches, six or seven 
constituting a bunch. Radishes are used merely for a relish, 
and are served uncooked. To prepare radishes for table, 
remove leaves, stems, and tip end of root, scrape roots, and 
serve on crushed ice. Round radishes look very attractive 
cut to imitate tulips, when they should not be scraped ; to 
accomplish this, begin at root end and make six incisions 
through skin running three-fourths length of radish. Pass 
knife under sections of skin, and cut down as far as incisions 
extend. Place in cold water, and sections of skin will fold 
back, giving radish a tulip-like appearance. 

Spinach 

Spinach is cheapest and best in early summer, but is ob- 
tainable throughout the year. It gives variety to winter diet, 
when most green vegetables are expensive and of inferior 
quality. 

Boiled Spinach 

Remove roots, carefully pick over (discarding wilted 
leaves), and wash in several waters to be sure that it is free 
from all sand. When young and tender put in a stewpan, 
allow to heat gradually, and boil twenty-five minutes, or 
until tender, in its own juices. Old spinach is better cooked 
in boiling salted water, allowing two quarts water to one 
peck spinach. Drain thoroughly, chop finely, reheat, and 
season with butter, salt, and pepper. Mound on a serving 
dish and garnish with slices of " hard-boiled " eggs and toast 
points. The green color of spinach is better retained by 
oooking in a large quantity of water in an uncovered 
vessel.

Chicken Stock. Season with one teaspoon powdered sugar, 
salt, pepper, and a few gratings each of nutmeg and lemon 

rind. 

Squash 

Summer squash, which are in market during the summer 
months, should be young, tender, and thin skinned. The 
common varieties are the white round and yellow crook- 
neck. Some of the winter varieties appear in market as 
early as the middle of August; among the most common 
are Marrow, Turban, and Hubbard. Turban and Hubbard 
are usually drier than Marrow. Marrow and Turban have 
a thin shell, which may be pared off before cooking. Hub- 
bard Squash has a very hard shell, which must be split in 
order to separate squash in pieces, and squash then cooked 
in the shell. In selecting winter squash, see that it is heavy 
in proportion to its size.

CHAPTER XX 
POTATOES 

COMPOSITION 

Water, 78. 9 % Proteid, 2.1 % 

Starch, 18% Mineral matter, .9% 

Fat 1.% 

OTATOES stand pre-eminent among the vegetables 

used for food. They are tubers belonging to the 

1 Nightshade family ; their hardy growth renders them easy 

; of cultivation in almost any soil or climate, and, resisting 

early frosts, they may be raised in a higher latitude than the 

I cereals. 

They give needed bulk to food rather than nutriment, 
and, lacking in proteid, should be used in combination with 
meat, fish, or eggs. 

Potatoes contain an acrid juice, the greater part of which 
lies near the skin ; it passes into the water during boiling of 
potatoes, and escapes with the steam from a baked potato. 

Potatoes are best in the fall, and keep well through the 
winter. By spring the starch is partially changed to dex- 
trin, giving the potatoes a sweetness, and when cooked a 
waxiness. The same change takes place when potatoes are 
frozen. To prevent freezing, keep a pail of cold water 
standing near them. 

Potatoes keep best in a cool dry cellar, in barrels or piled 
in a bin. When sprouts appear they should be removed; 
receiving their nourishment from the starch, they deteriorate 
the potato. 

New potatoes may be compared to unripe fruit, the starch 
grains not having reached maturity ; therefore they should 
not be given to children or invalids. 



810 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Sweet Potatoes 

Sweet potatoes, although analogous to white potatoes, are 
fleshy roots of the plant, belong to a different family (Con- 
volvulus), and contain a much larger percentage of sugar. 
Our own country produces large quantities of sweet potatoes, 
which may be grown as far north as New Jersey and South- 
ern Michigan. Kiln-dried sweet potatoes are the best, as 
they do not so quickly spoil. 

Baked Potatoes 

Select smooth, medium-sized potatoes. Wash, using a 
vegetable brush, and place in dripping-pan. Bake in hot 
oven forty minutes or until soft, remove from oven, and serve 
at once. If allowed to stand, unless the skin is ruptured for 
escape of steam, they become soggy. Properly baked pota- 
toes are more easily digested than potatoes cooked in any 
other way, as some of the starch is changed to dextrin by 
the intense heat. They are better cooked in boiling water 
than baked in a slow oven. 

Boiled Potatoes 4 

Select potatoes of uniform size. Wash, pare, and drop 
at once in cold water to prevent discoloration; soak one- 
half hour in the fall, and one to two hours in winter and 
spring. Cook in boiling salted water until soft, which is 
easily determined by piercing with a skewer. For seven 
potatoes allow one tablespoon salt, and boiling water to 
cover. Drain from water, and keep uncovered in warm 
place until serving time. Avoid sending to table in a cov- 
ered vegetable dish. In boiling large potatoes, it often 
happens that outside is soft, while centre is underdone. To 
finish cooking without potatoes breaking apart, add one pint 
cold water, which drives heat to centre, thus accomplishing 
the cooking. 

Riced Potatoes 

Force hot boiled potatoes through a potato ricer or coarse, 
strainer. Serve lightly piled ia a hot vegetable diih, 



POTATOES 811

CHAPTER XXI - 

SALADS AITS SALAD DRESSINGS 

SALADS, which constitute a course in almost every dinner, 
but a few years since seldom appeared on the table. They 
are now made in an endless variety of ways, and are com- 
posed of meat, fish, vegetables (alone or in combination) or 
fruits, with the addition of a dressing. The salad plants, 
lettuce, watercress, chiccory, cucumbers, etc., contain but 
little nutriment, but are cooling, refreshing, and assist in 
stimulating the appetite. They are valuable for the water 
and potash salts they contain. The olive oil, which usually 
forms the largest part of the dressing, furnishes nutriment, 
and is of much value to the system. 

Salads made of greens should always be served crisp and 
cold. The vegetables should be thoroughly washed, allowed 
to stand in cold or ice-water until crisp, then drained and 
spread on a towel and set aside in a cold place until serving 
time. See Lettuce, page 294. Dressing may be added at 
table or just before sending to table. If greens are allowed 
to stand in dressing they will soon wilt It should be re- 
membered that winter greens are raised under glass and 
should be treated as any other hothouse plant. Lettuce will 
be affected by a change of temperature and wilt just as 
quickly as delicate flowers. 

Canned or cold cooked left-over vegetables are well utilized 
in salads, but are best mixed with French Dressing and 
allowed to stand in a cold place one hour before serving. 
Where several vegetables are used in the same salad they 
should be marinated separately, and arranged for serving 
just before sending to table. 



SALAD DRESSINGS 323 

Meat for salads should be freed from skin and gristle, cut 
in small cubes, and allowed to stand mixed with French 
Dressing before combining with vegetables. Fish should be 
flaked or cut in cubes. 

Where salads are dressed at table, first sprinkle with salt 
and pepper, add oil, and lastly vinegar. If vinegar is added 
before oil, the greens will become wet, and oil will not cling, 
but settle to bottom of bowl. 

A Chapon. Remove a small piece from end of French 
loaf and rub over with a clove of garlic, first dipped in salt. 
Place in bottom of salad bowl before arranging salad. A 
chapon is often used in vegetable salads, and gives an 
agreeable additional flavor. 

To Marinate. The word marinate, as used in cookery, 
means to add salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar to a salad 
ingredient or mixture, then allow to let stand until well 
seasoned. 



SALAD DRESSINGS 

French Dressing 

J£ teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons vinegar 

% teaspoon pepper 4 tablespoons olive oil 

Mix ingredients and stir until well blended. Some prefer 
the addition of a few drops onion juice. French Dressing 
is more easily prepared and largely used than any other 
dressing.

Few grains cayenne 1)4 cups olive oil 

Mix dry ingredients, add egg yolks, and when well mixed 
add one-half teaspoon of vinegar. Add oil gradually, at 
first drop by drop, and stir constantly. As mixture thickens, 
thin with vinegar or lemon juice. Add oil, and vinegar or 
lemon Juice alternately, until all is used, stirriug or beating 
constantly. If oil is added too rapidly, dressing will have a 
curdled appearance. A smooth consistency may be restored 
by taking yolk of another egg and adding curdled mixture 
slowly to it It is desirable to have bowl containing mix- 
ture placed in a larger bowl of crushed ice, to which a small 
quantity of water has been added. Olive oil for making 
Mayonnaise should always be thoroughly chilled. A silver 
fork, wire whisk, small wooden spoon, or Dover Egg-beater 
may be used as preferred. If one has a Keystone Egg- 
beater, dressing may be made very quickly by its use. 
Mayonnaise should be stiff enough to hold its shape. It soon 
liquefies when added to meat or vegetables; therefore it 
should be added just before serving time. 

Mayonnaise Dressing II 

Use* same ingredients as for Mayonnaise Dressing I, add- 
ing mashed yolk of a " hard-boiled " egg to dry ingredients.

Swedish Timbales 

2£ cup flour y z cup milk 

y z teaspoon salt 1 egg . 

1 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon olive oil 

Mix dry ingredients, add milk gradually, and beaten egg ; 
then add olive oil. Shape, using a hot timbale iron, fry in 
deep fat until crisp and brown ; take from iron and invert 
on brown paper to drain. 

To Heat Timbale Iron. Heat fat until nearly hot enough 
to fry uncooked mixtures. Put iron into hot fat, having fat 
deep enough to more than cover it, and let stand until 
heated. The only way of knowing when iron is of right 
temperature is to take it from fat, shake what fat may drip 
from it, lower in batter to three- fourths its depth, raise from 
batter, then immerse in hot fat. If batter does not cling to 
iron, or drops from iron as soon as immersed in fat, it is 
either too hot or not sufficiently heated. 

To Form Timbales. Turn timbale batter into a cup. 
Lower hot iron into cup, taking care that batter covers 
iron to only three-fourths its depth. When immersed in 
fat, mixture will rise to top of iron, and when crisp and 
brown may be easily slipped off. If too much batter is 
used, in cooking it will rise over top of iron, and in order 
to remove timbale it must be cut around with a sharp knife 
close to top of iron. If the cases are soft rather than crisp, 
batter is too thick and must be diluted with milk. 

Fill cases with Creamed Oysters, Chicken, Sweetbreads, 
or Chicken and Sweetbreads in combination with Mush- 
rooms. 

Bunuelos 

Use recipe for and fry same as Swedish Timbales, using a

Aspic jelly is always made with meat stock, and is princi- 
pally used in elaborate entrees where fish, chicken, game, or 
vegetables are to be served moulded in jelly. In making 
Aspic Jelly, use as much liquid as the pan which is to con- 
tain moulded dish will hold. 

Put vegetables, seasonings, and wine (except two table- 
spoons) in a saucepan ; cook eight minutes, and strain, 
reserving liquid. Add gelatine to stock, then add lemon 
juice. Heat to boiling-point and add strained liquid. Sea- 
son with salt and cayenne. Beat whites of eggs slightly, 
add two tablespoons wine, and dilute with one cup hot mix- 
ture. Add slowly to remaining mixture, stirring constantly 
until boiling-point is reached. Place on back of range and 
let stand thirty minutes. Strain through a double cheese- 
cloth placed over a fine wire strainer, or through a jelly bag. 

Tomatoes in Aspic 

Peel six small firm tomatoes, and remove pulp, having 
opening in tops as small as possible. Sprinkle insides with 
salt, invert, and let stand thirty minutes. Fill with vegeta- 
ble or chicken salad. Cover tops with Mayonnaise to which 
has been added a small quantity of dissolved gelatine, and 
garnish with capers and sliced pickles. Place a pan in ice* 
water, cover bottom with aspic jelly mixture) and let stand 



ENTREES 383 

until jelly is firm. Arrange tomatoes on Jelly garnished sid* 
down. Add more aspic jelly mixture, let stand until firm, 
and so continue until all is used. Chill thoroughly, turn on 
a serving dish, and garnish around base with parsley. 

Staffed Olives in Aspic 

Stone olives, using an olive s toner, and fill cavities thus 
made with green butter. Place small Dario moulds in pan of 
ice- water, and pour in aspic jelly mixture (see p. 382) one- 
fourth inch deep. When firm put an olive in each mould 
(keeping oliyes in place by means of small wooden skewers) 
and add aspic by spoonfuls until moulds are filled. Chill 
thoroughly, remove to circular slices of liver sausage, garnish 
with green butter forced through a pastry bag and tube, yolks 
of u hard-boiled " eggs forced through a strainer, and red pep- 
pers cut in fancy shapes. 

Green Butter. Mix yolk one " hard-boiled " egg, two table- 
spoons butter, one sprig parsley, one sprig tarragon, one 
small shallot, one-half teaspoon anchovy paste, one teaspoon 
capers, and one teaspoon chopped gherkins, and pound in a 
mortar ; then rub through a very fine sieve. Season with 
salt and pepper, and add a few drops vinegar. 

Tongue in Aspio 

Cook a tongue according to directions on page 210. After 
removing skin and roots, run a skewer through tip of tongue 
and fleshy part, thus keeping tongue in shape. When cool, 
remove skewer. Put a round pan in ice-water, cover bottom 
with brown aspic, and when firm decorate with cooked car- 
rot, turnip, beet cut in fancy shapes, and parsley. Cover 
with aspic jelly mixture, adding it by spoonfuls so as not to 
disarrange vegetables. When this layer of mixture is firm, 
put in tongue, adding gradually remaining mixture as in To- 
matoes in Aspic. 

Birds in Aspio 

Clean, bone, stuff, and truss a bird, then steam over body 
bonei or lOftftt* If roasted, do not dredge with flour. Put 



884 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

a pan in ice-water, cover bottom with aspic jelly mixture, 
and when firm garnish with truffles and egg custard thinly 
sliced and cut in fancy shapes. The smaller the shapes 
the more elaborate may be the designs. When garnishing 
with small shapes, pieces are so difficult to handle that 
they should be taken on the pointed end of a larding- needle, 
and placed as desired on jelly. Add aspic mixture by 
spoonfuls, that designs may not be disturbed. When mix- 
ture is added, and firm to the depth of three-fourths inch, 
place in the bird, breast down. If sides of mould are to 
be decorated, dip pieces in jelly and they will cling to pan. 
Add remaining mixture gradually as in Tomatoes in Aspic. 
Small birds, chicken, capon, or turkey, may be put in 
aspic. 

Egg Custard for Decorating 

Separate yolks from whites of two eggs. Beat yolks 
slightly, add two tablespoons milk and few grains salt.

whites slightly, add few grains salt, and cook as yolks. 
Cool, turn from cups, cut in thin slices, then in desired 
shapes.

cooked chicken, or one pound of uncooked lean veal. Add 
one-half cup cracker crumbs, hot stock to moisten, salt, 
pepper, celery salt, cayenne, lemon juice, and one egg

aud wings, being careful that too much stuffing is not used, 
as an allowance must be made for the swelling of cracker 
crumbs.

on the spoon, strain immediately ; chill and flavor. If cooked 
too long the custard will curdle ; should this happen, by 
using a Dover egg-beater it may be restored to a smooth 
consistency, but custard will not be as thick. Eggs should 
be beaten slightly for custard, that it may be of smooth, 
thick consistency. To prevent scum from forming, cover 
with a perforated tin. When eggs are scarce, use yolks two 
eggs and one-half tablespoon corn-starch.

To Whip Cream 

Thin and heavy cream are both used in making and gar- 
nishing desserts. 

Heavy cream is bought in half-pint, pint, and quart glass 
jars, and usually retails at sixty cents per quart ; thin or 
strawberry cream comes in glass jars or may be bought in 
bulk, and usually retails for thirty cents per quart. Heavy 
cream is very rich ; for which reason, when whipped without 



426 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

being diluted, it is employed as a garnish ; even when so 
used, it ie generally diluted with one-fourth to one-third its 
bulk in milk ; when used in combination with other ingredients 
for making desserts, it is diluted from one-half to two-thirds 
its bulk in milk. Thin cream is whipped without being 
diluted. Cream should be thoroughly chilled for whipping. 
Turn cream to be whipped into a bowl (care being taken not 
to select too large a bowl), and set in pan of crushed ice, 
to which water is added that cream may be quickly chilled ; 
without addition of water, cream will not be so thoroughly 
chilled. 

For whipping heavy cream undiluted, or diluted with one- 
third or less its bulk in milk, use Dover egg-beater; un- 
diluted heavy cream if beaten a moment too long will come 
to butter. Heavy cream diluted, whipped, sweetened, and 
flavored, is often served with puddings, and called Cream 
Sauce. 

Thin cream is whipped by using a whip churn, as is heavy 
cream when diluted with one-half to two-thirds its bulk in 
milk. Place churn in bowl containing cream, hold down 
cover with left hand, with right hand work dasher with quick 
downward and slow upward motions; avoid raising dasher 
too high in cylinder, thus escaping spattering of cream. 
The first whip which appears should be stirred into cream, 
as air bubbles are too large and will break ; second whip 
should be removed by spoonfuls to a strainer, strainer 
to be placed in a pan, as some cream will drain through. 
The first cream which drains through may be turned into 
bowl to be rewhipped, and continue whipping as long as 
■possible. 

There will be some cream left in bowl which does not 
come above perforations in whip churn, and cannot be 
whipped. Cream which remains may be scalded and used 
to dissolve gelatine when making desserts which require 

gelatine. Cream should treble its bulk in whipping. By 
following these directions one need have no difficulty, if 
cream is of ri^ht consistency ; always bearing in mind heavy 
cream mist be whipped with a Dover egg-beaetr ; thin cream 
must be, whipped with a churn.

ICES, ICE CKEAMS, ETC. 433 



CHAPTER XXVI 

ICES, ICE CBEAXS, AND OTHEB FBOZEN DESSEBTS 

ICES and other frozen dishes comprise the most popular 
desserts. Hygienically speaking, they cannot be recom- 
mended for the final course of a dinner, as cold mixtures 
reduce the temperature of the stomach, thus retarding diges- 
tion until the normal temperature is again reached. But 
how cooling, refreshing, and nourishing, when properly taken, 
and of what inestimable value in the sick room ! 

Frozen dishes include : — 

Water Ice, — fruit juice sweetened, diluted with water, and 
frozen. 

Sherbet, — water ice to which is added a small quantity of 
dissolved gelatine or beaten whites of eggs. 

Frappi, — water ice frozen to consistency of mush ; in 
freezing, equal parts of salt and ice being used to make it 
granular. 

Punchy — water ice to which is added spirit and spice. 

Sorbet, — strictly speaking, frozen punch; the name is 
often given to a water ice where several kinds of fruit are 
used. 

Philadelphia Ice Cream, — thin cream, sweetened, flavored, 
and frozen. 

Plain Ice Cream, — custard foundation, thin cream, and 
flavoring. 

Mousse, — heavy cream, beaten until stiff, sweetened, 
flavored, placed in a mould, packed in salt and ice (using 
two parts crushed ice to one part salt), and allowed to stand 
three hours ; or whip from thin cream may be used folded 
into mixture containing small quantity of gelatine*.

How to Freeze Desserts 

The prejudice of thinking a frozen dessert difficult to pre* 
pare has long since been overcome. With ice cream freezer, 
burlap bag, wooden mallet or axe, small saucepan, sufficient 
ice and coarse rock salt, the process neither takes much time 
nor patience. Snow may be used instead of ice ; if not 
readily acted on by salt, pour iu one cup cold water. Crush 
ice finely by placing in bag and giving a few blows with 
mallet or broad side of axe ; if there are any coarse pieces, 
remove them. Place can containing mixture to be frozen in 
wooden tub, cover, and adjust top. Turn crank to make 
sure can fits in socket. Allow three level measures ice to 
one of salt, and repeat until ice and salt come to top of can, 
packing solidly, using handle of mallet to force it down. If 
only small quantity js to be frozen, the ice and salt need 
come only a little higher in the tub than mixture to be frozen. 
These are found the best proportions of ice and salt to 
insure smooth, fine-grained cream, sherbet, or water ice, 
while equal parts of salt and ice are used for freezing frappe. 
If a larger proportion of salt is used, mixture will freeze in 
shorter time and be of granular consistency, which is desirable 
only for frappe. 

The mixture increases in bulk during freezing, so the can 
should never be more than three-fourths filled; by over- 
crowding can, cream will be made coarse-grained. Turn the 
crank slowly and steadily to expose as large surface of mix- 
ture as possible to ice and salt. After frozen to a mush, the 
crank may be turned more rapidly, adding more ice and salt 
if needed ; never draw off salt water until mixture is frozen, 
unless there is possibility of its getting into the can, for salt 
water is what effects freezing ; until ice melts, no change 
will take place. After freezing is accomplished, draw off 
water, remove dasher, and with spoon pack solidly. Put 
cork in opening of cover, then put on cover. Re-pack 
freezer, using four measures ice to one of salt. Place over 
top newspapers or piece of carpet ; when serving time comes, 
remove can, wipe carefully, and place in vessel of cool water; 
let stand one minute, remove cover, and run a knife around 



I0E8, ICE CREAMS, ETC. 435 

edge of cream, invert can on serving dish, and frozen mix- 
ture will slip out. Should there be any difficulty, a cloth 
wrung out of hot water, passed over can, will aid in removing 
mixture. 

To Line a Mould 

Allow mould to stand in salt and ice until well chilled. 
Remove cover, put in mixture by spoonfuls, and spread with 
back of spoon or a case knife evenly three-quarters inch 
thick. 

To Mould Frozen Mixtures 

When frozen mixtures are to be bricked or moulded, avoid 
freezing too hard. Pack mixture solidly in moulds and cover 
with buttered paper, buttered side up. Have moulds so well 
filled that mixture is forced down sides of mould when cover 
is pressed down. Re-pack in salt and ice, using four parts 
ice to one part salt. If these directions are carefully fol- 
lowed, one may feel no fear that salt water will enter cream, 
even though moulds be immersed in salt water.

CHAPTER XXVn 

PASTBT 

PASTRY cannot be easily excluded from the menu of 
the New Englander. Who can dream of a Thanks- 
giving dinner without a pie! The last decade has done 
much to remove pies from the daily bill of fare, and in 
their place are found delicate puddings and seasonable 
fruits. 

If pastry is to be served, have it of the best, — light, flaky, 
and tender. 

To pastry belongs, 1st, Pun* Paste ; 2d, Plain Paste. 

Puff paste, which to many seems so difficult of preparation, 
is rarely attempted by any except professionals. As a mat- 
ter of fact, one who has never handled a rolling-pin is less 
liable to fail, under the guidance of a good teacher, than an 
old cook, who finds it difficult to overcome the bad habit of 
using too much force in rolling. It is necessary to work 
rapidly and with a light touch. A cold room is of great 
advantage. 

For making pastry, pastry flour and the best shortenings, 
thoroughly chilled, are essential. Its lightness depends on 
the amount of air enclosed and expansion of that air in bak- 
ing. The flakiness depends upon kind and amount of 
shortening used. Lard makes more tender crust than but- 
ter, but lacks flavor which butter gives. Puff paste is 
usually shortened with butter, though some chefs prefer 
beef suet. Eggs and ice were formerly used, but are not 
essentials. 

Butter should be washed if pastry Is to be of the best, so 
as to remove salt and. buttermilk, thus making it of a waxy 
consistency, easy to handle.

PASTRY 461 

Rolas for 'Washing Butter. Scald and chill an earthen 
bowl. Heat palms of bands in hot water, and chill in cold 
water. By following these directions, butter will not adhere 
to bowl nor hands. Wash butter in bowl by squeezing with 
hands until soft and waxy, placing bowl under a cold-water 
faucet and allowing water to run. A small amount of butter 
may be washed by using a wooden spoon in place of the 
hands. 

For rolling paste, use a smooth wooden board, and wooden 
rolling-pin with handles. 

Puff paste should be used for vol-au-vents, patties, ris- 
soles, bouch&s, cheese straws, tarts, etc. - It may t>e used 
for rims and upper crusts of pies, but never for lower crusts. 
Plain paste may be used where pastry is needed, except for 
Tol-au-vents and patties. 

Puff Paste 

1 pound batter 1 pound pastry flour or 14 ozs. bread flour 

Cold water 

Wash the butter, pat and fold until no water flies Re- 
serve two tablespoons of butter, and shape remainder into a 
circular piece one-half inch thick, and put on floured board. 
Work two tablespoons of butter into flour with the tips of 
fingers of the right hand. Moisteu to a dough with cold 
water, turn on slightly floured board, and knead one minute. 
Cover with towel, and let stand ^\e minutes. 

Pat and roll one-fourth inch thick, keeping paste a little 
wider than long, and corners square. If this cannot be ac- 
complished with rolling-pin, draw into shape with fingers. 
Place butter on centre of lower half of paste. Cover butter 
by folding upper half of paste over it Press edges firmly, 
to enclose as much air as possible. 

Fold right side of paste over enclosed butter, the left side 
under enclosed butter. Turn paste half-way round, cover, 
and let stand Ave minutes. Pat, and roll one-fourth inch 
thick, having paste longer than wide, lifting often to prevent 
paste from sticking, and dredging board slightly with flour 
when necessary. Fold from ends towards centre, making 
three layers. Cover, and let stand five minutes. Repeat 



462 BOSTON COOKING-SOHOOL COOK BOOK 

twice, turning paste half-way round each time before rolling. 
After fourth rolling, fold from ends to centre, and double, 
making four layers. Put in cold place to chill ; if outside 
temperature is not sufficiently cold, fold paste in a towel, put 
in a dripping-pan, and place between dripping pans of crushed 
ice. If paste is to be kept for several days, wrap in a nap- 
kin, put in tin pail and cover tightly, then put in cold place; 
if in ice box, do not allow pail to come in direct contact with 
ice. 

To Bake Puff Paste 

Baking of puff paste requires as much care and judgment 
as making. After shaping, chill thoroughly before baking. 
Puff paste requires hot oven, greatest heat coming from the 
bottom, that the paste may properly rise. While rising it is 
often necessary to decrease the heat by lifting covers or 
opening the check to stove. Turn frequently, that it may 
rise evenly. When it has risen its full height, slip a pan 
under the sheet on which paste is baking to prevent burning 
on the bottom. Puff paste should be baked on a tin sheet 
covered with a double thickness of brown paper, or dripping- 
pan may be used, lined with brown paper. The temperature 
for baking of patties should be about the same as for raised 
biscuit ; vol-au-vents require less heat, and are covered for 
first half -hour to prevent scorching on top. 

Fatty Shells 

Roll puff paste one-quarter inch thick, shape with a patty 
cutter, first dipped in flour ; remove centres from one- half 
the rounds with smaller cutter. Brush over with cold water 
the larger pieces near the edge, and fit on rings, pressing 
lightly. Place in towel between pans of crushed ice, and 
chill until paste is stiff; if cold weather, chill out of doors. 
Place on iron or tin sheet covered with brown paper, and 
bake twenty-five minutes in hot oven. The shells should rise 
their full height and begin to brown in twelve to fifteen min- 
utes ; continue browning, and finish baking in twenty-five 
minutes. Pieces cut from centre of rings of patties may be 
baked and used for patty covers, or put together, rolled, and

cat for unders. Trimmings from puff paste should be care- 
fully laid on top of each other, patted, and rolled oat. 

Vol-au-vents 

Roll puff paste one-third inch thick, mark an oral on paste 
with cutter or mould, and cut out with sharp knife, first 
dipped in flour. Brush over near the edge with cold water, 
pat on a rim three-fourths inch wide, press lightly, chill, and 
bake. Vol-au-vents require for baking forty-five minutes to 
one hour. During the first half- hour they should be covered, 
watched carefully, and frequently turned. The paste cut 
from centre of rim should be rolled one-quarter inch thick, 
shaped same size as before rolling, chilled, baked, and used 
for cover to the Vol-au-vent 

Quick Puff Paste 

1 cup bread flour Cold water 

1 tablespoon lard % cup butter 

Work lard into flour, first using knife then tips of fingers. 
Moisten to a dough with cold water, pat, and roll out same 
as Puff Paste. Dot paste with small pieces of butter, using 
one-third the quantity. Dredge with flour, fold from ends 
toward centre, then double, making four layers. Pat, and 
roll out. Repeat until butter is used. Roll, shape, chill, and 
bake in a hot oven.

Cold water 

Wash butter, pat, and form in circular piece. Add salt 
to flour, and work in lard with tips of fingers or case knife. 
Moisten to dough with cold water ; ice-water is not an essen- 
tial, but is desirable in summer. Toss on board dredged 
sparingly with flour, pat, and roll out ; fold in butter as for 
puff paste, pat, and roll out. Fold so as to make three lay- 
ers, turn half-way round, pat, and roll out; repeat. The 
pastry may be used at once ; if not, fold in cheese-cloth, put 
in covered tin, and keep in cold place, but never in direct

contact with ice. Plain paste requires a moderate oven. 
This is superior paste and quickly made. 

Chopped Paste 

2 cups flour % cup butter - 

2 tablespoons lard % teaspoon salt 

Cold water 

Wash butter. Mix salt with flour, put in chopping tray, 
add lard and butter, and chop until well mixed. Moisten to 
a dough with cold water. Toss on floured cloth (Magic 
Cover), pat, and roll out. Fold so as to make three layers, 
turn half-way round, pat, and roll out; repeat. Should the 
butter be too hard, it will not mix readily with the flour, in 
which case the result will be a tough crust Omit lard, and 
use all butter, if preferred.

a floured board, pat, and roll out. Spread with one table- 
spoon reserved lard, dredge with flour, roll up like a jelly 
roll, pat, and roll out ; again roll up. Cut from the end of 
roll a piece large enough to line a pie plate. Pat and roll 
out, keeping the paste as circular in form as possible. With 
care and experience there need be no trimmings. Worked- 
over pastry is never as satisfactory. The remaining one- 
fourth tablespoon lard is used to dot over upper crust of pie 



PASTRY 465 

just before sending to oven; this gives the pie a flaky 
appearance. Ice-water has a similar effect If milk is 
brushed over the pie it has a glazed appearance. This 
quantity of paste will make one pie with two crusts and a 
few puffs, or two pies with one crust where the rim is built 
up and fluted. 

Entire Wheat Paste

finely chopped add water to make a very stiff dough, using 
as little as possible. Cut the butter into the dough leaving 
it in rather coarse pieces. Chill in icebox for several hours- 
or over night. Place ball of paste on floured cloth, pat and 
roll out. Fold so as to make three layers, turn half way 
round, pat and roll out Pat, roll and fold four times, shape

CHAPTER XXVIII 
PIES 

PASTE for pies should be one-fourth inch thick and 
rolled a little larger than the plate to allow for shrink- 
ing. In dividing paste for pies, allow more for upper than 
under crusts. Always perforate upper crusts that steam 
may escape. Some make a design, others pierce with a 
large fork. 

Flat rims for pies should be cut in strips three-fourths 
inch wide. Under crusts should be brushed with cold water 
before putting on rims, and rims slightly fulled, otherwise 
they will shrink from edge of plate. The pastry-jagger, a 
simple device for cutting paste, makes rims with fluted 
edges. 

Pies requiring two crusts sometimes have a rim between 
the crusts. This is mostly confined to mince pieces, where 
there is little danger of juice escaping. Sometimes a rim 
is placed over upper crust. Where two pieces of paste 
are put together, the under piece should always be brushed 
with cold water, the upper piece placed over, and the two 
pressed lightly together ; otherwise they will separate during 
baking. 

When juicy fruit is used for filling pies, some of the 
juices are apt to escape during baking. As a precaution, 
bind with a strip of cotton cloth wrung out of cold water 
and cut one inch wide and long enough to encircle the 
plate. Squash, pumpkin, and custard pies are much less 
care during baking when bound. Where cooked fruits are 
used for filling, it is desirable to bake crusts separately. 
This is best accomplished by covering an inverted deep 
pie plate with paste and baking for under crust Prick 
with a fork before baking. Slip from plate, and fill. For 



pies 467 

tipper cruets, roll a piece of paste a little larger than the 
pie plate, prick, and bake on a tin sheet. 

For baking pies, perforated tin plates are used. They 
may be bought shallow or deep. By the use of such plates 
the under crust is well cooked. Pastry should be thor- 
oughly baked and well browned. Pies require from thirty- 
five to forty-five minutes for baking. Never grease a pie 
plate ; good pastry greases its own tin. Slip pies, when 
slightly cooled, to earthen plates. 

Apple Fie I 

4 or 5 sour apples % teaspoon salt 

y z cup sugar 1 teaspoon butter 

>4 teaspoon grated nutmeg 1 teaspoon lemon juice 

Few gratings lemon rind 

Line pie plate with paste. Pare, core, and cut the apples 
into eighths, put row around plate one-half inch from edge, 
and work towards centre until plate is covered; then pile 
on remainder. Mix sugar, nutmeg, salt, lemon juice, and 
grated rind, and sprinkle over apples. Dot over with 
butter. Wet edges of under crust, cover with upper crust, 
and press edges together. 

Bake forty to forty-five minutes in moderate oven. A 
very good pie may be made without butter, lemon juice, and 
grated rind. Cinnamon may be substituted for nutmeg. 
Evaporated apples may be used in place of fresh fruit. If 
used, they should be soaked over night in cold water. 

Apple Pie II 

Use same ingredients as for Apple Pie I. Place in small 
earthen baking-dish and add hot water to prevent apples 
from burning. Cover closely, and bake three hours in very 
slow oven, when apples will be a dark red color. Brown 
sugar may be used instead of white sugar, a little more 
being required. Cool, and bake between two crusts. 

Blackberry Pie 

Pick over and wash one and one-half cups berries. Stew 
until soft with enough water to prevent burning. Add sugar 



468 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

to taste, and one-eighth teaspoon salt. Line plate with 
paste, put on a rim, fill with berries (which have been 
cooled) ; arrange six strips pastry across the top, cut same 
width as rim ; put on an upper rim. Bake thirty minutes in 
moderate oven. 

Blueberry Pie 

2)£ cups berries % cup sugar 

Flour % teaspoon salt 

Line a deep plate with Plain Paste, fill with berries 
slightly dredged with flour; sprinkle with sugar and salt, 
cover, and bake forty-five to fifty minutes in a moderate 
oven. For sweetening, some prefer to use one-third molas- 
ses, the remaining two-thirds to be sugar. Six green grapes 
(from which seeds have been removed) cut in small pieces 
much improve the flavor, particularly where huckleberries 
are used in place of blueberries. 

Cranberry Pie 

\% cups cranberries % cup water 

% cup sugar 

Put ingredients in saucepan in order given, and cook ten 
minutes ; cool, and bake in one crust, with a rim, and strips 
across the top.

1 cup currants )£ cup flour 

1 cup sugar 2 egg yolks 

2 tablespoons water 

Mix flour and sugar, add yolks of eggs slightly beaten 
and diluted with water. Wash currants, drain, remove 
stems, then measure ; add to first mixture and bake in one 
crust; cool, and cover with Meringue I. Cook in slow oven 
until delicately browned. 

Cream Pie 

Bake three crusts on separate pie plates. Put together 
with Cream Filling and dust over with powdered sugar. If 



pies 469 

allowed to stand after filling for any length of time, the 
pastry will soften. 

Custard Pie 

2 eggs % teaspoon salt 

3 tablespoons sugar \% cups milk 

Few gratings nutmeg 

Beat eggs slightly, add sugar, salt, and milk. Line plate 
with paste, and build up a fluted rim. Strain in the mix- 
ture and sprinkle with few gratings nutmeg. Bake in quick 
oven at first to set rim, decrease the heat afterwards, as 
egg and milk in combination need to be cooked at low 
temperature." 

Date Pie 

2 cups milk 2 eggs 

% pound sugar dates M teaspoon salt 

Few gratings nutmeg 

Cook dates with milk twenty minutes in top of double 
boiler. Strain, and rub through sieve, then add eggs and 
salt. Bake same as Custard Pie.

beaten, milk, butter, whites of eggs beaten stiff, and salt. 
Bake in one crust, and cover with meringue or not, as 
desired. 

Mince Pies 

Mince pies should be always baked with two crusts. 
For Thanksgiving and Christmas pies, Puff Paste is often 
used for rims and upper crusts, but is never satisfactory 
when used for under crusts.

MERINGUES 

For Pies, ictiddings, and Desserts 

Eggs for meringues should be thoroughly chilled, and 
beaten with silver fork, wire spoon, or whisk. Where sev- 
eral eggs are needed, much time is saved by using a whisk. 
Meringues on pies, puddings, or desserts may be spread 
evenly, spread and piled in the centre, put on lightly by 
spoonfuls, or spread evenly with part of the mixture, the 
remainder being forced through a pastry bag and tube. 

Meringues I and III should be baked fifteen minutes in 
slow oven. Meringue II should be cooked eight minutes

ping-pan. Crease in three-inch squares, and bake in a slow 
oven until delicately browned. Place pan on back of range, 
cut squares apart with a sharp knife, and roil while warm in 
tubular or cornucopia shape. If squares become too brittle 
to roll, place in oven to soften. If rolled tubular shape, tie 
in bunches with narrow ribbon. These are very attractive, 
and may be served with sherbet, ice cream, or chocolate. If 
rolled cornucopia shape, they may be filled with whipped 
cream just before sending to table. Colored wafers may be 
made from this mixture by adding leaf green or fruit red. 
If colored green, flavor with one-fourth teaspoon almond and 
three-fourths teaspoon vanilla. If colored pink, flavor with 
rose. Colored wafers must be baked in a very slow oven 
and turned frequently, otherwise they will not be of the 
uniform color that is desired.

CHAPTER XXXI 
CAKE 

THE mixing and baking of cake requires more care and 
judgment than any other branch of cookery ; notwith- 
standing, it seems the one most frequently attempted by the 
inexperienced. 

Two kinds of cake mixtures are considered : — 

I. Without butter. Example : Sponge Cakes. 

II. With butter. Examples : Cup and Pound Cakes. 

In cake making (1) the best ingredients are essential ; (2) 
great care must be taken in measuring and combining in' 
gredients; (3) pans must be properly prepared; (4) oven 
heat must be regulated, and cake watched during baking. 

Best tub butter, fine granulated sugar, fresh eggs, and 
pastry flour are essentials for good cake. Coarse granulated 
sugar, bought by so many, if used in cake making, gives a 
coarse texture and hard crust. Pastry flour contains more 
starch and less gluten than bread flour, therefore makes a 
lighter, more tender cake. If bread flour must be used, 
allow two tablespoons less for each cup than the recipe calls 
for. Flour differs greatly in thickening properties; for 
this reason it is always well when using from a new bag to 
try a small cake, as the amount of flour given may not 
make the perfect loaf. In winter, cake may be made of less 
flour than in summer. 

Before attempting to mix cake, study How to Measure 
(p. 25) and How to Combine Ingredients (p. 26). 

Look at the fire, and replenish by sprinkling on a small 
quantity of coal if there is not sufficient heat to effect the 
baking. 



498 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

To Mix Sponge Cake. Separate yolks from whites of 
eggs. Beat yolks until thick and lemon-colored, using an 
egg-beater ; add sugar gradually, and continue beating ; 
then add flavoring. Beat whites until stiff and dry, — when 
they will fly from the beater, — and add to the first mixture. 
Mix and sift flour with salt, and cut and fold in at the last. 
If mixture is beaten after the addition of flour, much of the 
work already done of enclosing a large amount of air will 
be undone by breaking air bubbles. These rules apply to a 
mixture where baking powder is not employed. 

To Mix Butter Cakes. An earthen bowl should always 
be used for mixing cake, and a wooden cake-spoon with slits 
lightens the labor. Measure dry ingredients, and mix and 
sift baking powder and spices, if used, with flour. Count 
out number of eggs required, breaking each separately that 
there may be no loss should a stale egg chance to be found 
in the number, separating yolks from whites if rule so speci- 
fies. Measure butter, then liquid. Having everything in 
readiness, the mixing may be quickly accomplished. If but- 
ter is very hard, by allowing it to stand a short time in a 
warm room it is measured and creamed much easier. If 
time cannot be allowed for this to be done, warm bowl by 
pouring in some hot water, letting stand one minute, then 
emptying and wiping dry. Avoid overheating bowl, as but- 
ter will become oily rather than creamy. Put butter in bowl, 
and cream by working with a wooden spoon until soft and 
of a creamy consistency ; then add sugar gradually, and con- 
tinue beating. Add yolks of eggs or whole eggs beaten 
until light, liquid, and flour mixed and sifted with baking 
powder; or liquid and flour may be added alternately. 
When yolks and whites of eggs are beaten separately, whites 
are usually added at the last, as is the case when whites of 
eggs alone are used. A cake can be made fine-grained only 
by long beating, although light and delicate with a small 
amount of beating. Never stir cake after the final beating, 
remembering that beating motion should always be the last 
used. Fruit, when added to cake, is usually floured to pre- 
vent its settling to the bottom. This is not necessary if it is 
added directly after the sugar, which is desirable in all dark 



CAKE 499 

cakes. If a light fruit cake is made, fruit' added in this way 
discolors the loaf. Citron is first cut in thin slices, then in 
strips, floured, and put in between layers of cake mixtures. 
Raisins are seeded and cut, rather than chopped. To seed 
raisins, wet tips of fingers in a cup of warm water. Then 
break skins with fingers or cut with a vegetable knife ; re- 
move seeds, and put in cup of water. This is better than 
covering raisins with warm water; if this be done, water 
clings to fruit, and when dredged with flour a pasty mass is 
formed on the outside. Washed currants, put up in pack- 
ages, are quite free from stems and foreign substances, and 
need only picking over and rolling in flour. Currants bought 
in bulk need thorough cleaning. First roll in flour, which 
helps to start dirt ; wash in cold water, drain, and spread to 
dry ; then roll again in flour before using. 

To Butter and Fill Pans. Grease pans with melted fat, 
applying the same with a butter brush. If butter is used, 
put in a small saucepan and place on back of range ; when 
melted, salt will settle to the bottom; butter is then called 
clarified. Just before putting in mixture, dredge pans thor- 
oughly with flour, invert, and shake pan to remove all super- 
fluous flour, leaving only a thin coating which adheres to 
butter. This gives to cake a smooth under surface, which is 
especially desirable if cake is to be frosted. Pans may be 
lined with paper. If this is done, paper should just cover 
bottom of pan and project over sides. Then ends of pan 
and paper are buttered. 

In filling pans, have the mixture come well to the corners 
and sides of pans, leaving a slight depression in the centre, 
and when baked the cake will be perfectly flat on top. Cake 
pans should be filled nearly two-thirds full if cake is expected 
to rise to top of pan. 

To Bake Cake. The baking of cake is more critical than 
the mixing. Many a well- mixed cake has been spoiled in 
the baking. No oven thermometer has yet proved practical, 
and although many teachers of cookery have given oven 
tests, experience alone has proved the most reliable teacher. 
In baking cake, divide the time required into quarters. Dur- 
ing the first quarter the mixture should begin to rise ; second 



500 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

quarter, continue rising and begin to brown ; third quarter, 
continue browning ; fourth quarter, finish baking and shrink 
from pan. If oven is too hot, open check and raise back 
covers, or leave oven door ajar. It is sometimes necessary 
to cover cake with brown paper ; there is, however, danger 
of cake adhering to paper. Cake should be often looked at 
during baking, and providing oven door is opened and closed 
carefully, there is no danger of this causing cake to fall. 
Cake should not be moved in oven until it has risen its full 
height ; after this it is usually desirable to move it that it 
may be evenly browned. Cake when done shrinks from the 
pan, and in most cases this is a sufficient test ; however, in 
pound cakes this rule does not apply. Pound and rich fruit 
cakes are tested by pressing surface with tip of finger. If 
cake feels firm to touch and follows finger back into place, 
it is safe to remove it from the oven. When baking cake 
arrange to have nothing else in the oven, and place loaf or 
loaves as near the centre of oven as possible. If placed close 
to fire box, one side of loaf is apt to become burned before 
sufficiently risen to turn. If cake is put in too slow au oven, 
it often rises over sides of pan and is of very coarse texture ; 
if put in too hot an oven, it browns on top before sufficiently 
risen, and in its attempt to rise breaks through the crust, 
thus making an unsightly loaf. Cake will also crack on top 
if too much flour has been used. The oven should be kept 
at as nearly uniform temperature as possible. Small and 
layer cakes require a hotter oven than loaf cakes. 

To Remove Cake From Pans. Remove cake from pans 
as soon as it comes from the oven, by inverting pan on a 
wire cake cooler, or on a board covered with a piece of old 
linen. If cake is inclined to stick, do not hurry it from pfin, 
but loosen with knife around edges, and rest pan on its four 
sides successively; thus by its own weight cake may be 
helped out. 

To Frost Cake. Where cooked frostings are used, it 
makes but little difference whether they are spread on hot 
or cold cake. Where uncooked frostings are used, it is best 
to have the cake slightly warm, with the exception of Con- 
fectioners' Frosting, where boiling water is employed.

and dry. When whites are partially mixed with yolks, 
remove beater, and carefully cut and fold in flour mixed and 
sifted with salt. Bake one hour in a slow oven, in an angel 
cake pan or deep narrow pan. 

Genuine sponge cake contains no rising properties, but is 
made light by the quantity of air beaten into both yolks and 
whites of eggs, and the expansion of that air in baking. It 
requires a slow oven. All so-called sponge cakes which have 
the addition of soda and cream of tartar or baking powder 
require same oven temperature as butter cakes. When 
failures are made in Sunshine and Angel Cake, they are 
usually traced to baking in too slow an oven, and removing 
from oven before thoroughly cooked.

Fondant Icing 

The mixture in which small cakes are dipped for icing is 
fondant, the recipe for which may be found in chapter on 
Confections. Cakes for dipping must first be glazed. 

To Glaze Cakes. Beat white of one egg slightly, and add 
one tablespoon powdered sugar. Apply with a brush to top 
and sides of cakes. After glazing, cakes should stand over 
night before dipping. 

To Dip Cakes. Melt fondant over hot water, and color 
and flavor as desired. Stir, to prevent crust from forming 
on top. Take cake to be dipped on a three-tined fork and 
lower in fondant three-fourths the depth of cake. Remove 
from fondant, invert, and slip from fork to a board. Deco- 
rate with ornamental frosting and nut meat, candied cherries, 
angelica, or candied violets. For small ornamented cakes, 
pound cake mixture is baked a little more than one inch 
thick in shallow pans, and when cool cut in squares, dia- 
monds, triangles, circles, crescents, etc. 

Marshmallow Frosting 

Melt one cup white fondant; add the white of one egg 
beaten until stiff, and stir over the fire two minutes. Re- 
move from range, and beat until of right consistency to 
spread. Flavor with one-fourth teaspoon water white vanilla.

This is a most delicious frosting for chocolate cake, but will 
never spread perfectly smooth. 

Ornamental Frosting I 

2 cups auger Whites 3 eggs 

1 cup water J£ teaspoon tartaric acid 

Boil sugar and water until syrup when dropped from tip 
of spoon forms a long thread. Pour syrup gradually on 
beaten whites of eggs, beating constantly; then add acid 
and continue beating. When stiff enough to spread, put a 
thin coating over cake. Beat remaining frosting until cold 
and stiff enough to keep in shape after being forced through 
a pastry tube. After first coating on cake has hardened, 
cover with a thicker layer, and crease for cutting. If frost- 
ing is too stiff to spread smoothly, thin with a few drops of 
water. With a pastry bag and variety of tubes, cake may 
be ornamented as desired. 

Ornamental Frosting II 

Whites 3 eggs 1 tablespoon lemon juice 

Confectioners' sugar, sifted 

Put eggs in a large bowl, add two tablespoons sugar, and 
beat three minutes, using a perforated wooden spoon. Re- 
peat until one and one-half cups sugar are used. Add 
lemon juice gradually, as mixture thickens. Continue add- 
ing sugar by spoonfuls, and beating until frosting is stiff 
enough to spread. This may be determined by taking up 
some of mixture on back of spoon, and with a case knife 
making a cut through mixture ; if knife makes a clean cut 
and frosting remains parted, it is of right consistency. 
Spread cake thinly with frosting ; when this has hardened, 
put on a thicker layer, having mixture somewhat stiffer than 
first coating, and then crease for cutting. To remaining 
frosting add enough more sugar, that frosting may keep in 
shape after being forced through a pastry bag and tube. 

With a pastry bag and variety of tubes, cake may be 
ornamented as desired.

FANCj CAKES AND CONFECTIONS 533 



CHAPTER XXXIII 
FANCY CAKES AITD CONFECTIONS 

ALMOND paste for making macaroons and small fancy 
cakes may be bought of dealers who keep confectioners' 
supplies, although sometimes a resident baker or confectioner 
will sell a small quantity. Almond paste is put up in five- 
pound tin pails, and retails for one and one-half dollars per 
pail. During the cold weather it will keep after being opened 
for a long time. 

Macaroons 

>2 lb. almond paste Whites 3 eggs 

% lb. powdered sugar 

Work together almond paste and sugar on a smooth board 
or marble slab. Then add whites of eggs gradually, and 
work until mixture is perfectly smooth. Confectioners at 
first use the hand, afterwards a palette knife, which is not 
only of use for mixing but for keeping board clean. Shape, 
using a pastry bag and tube, on a tin sheet covered with 
buttered paper, one-half inch apart ; or drop mixture from 
tip of spoon in small piles. Macaroon mixture is stiff enough 
to hold its shape, but in baking spreads. Bake fifteen to 
twenty minutes in a slow oven. If liked soft, they should 
be slightly baked. After removing from oven, invert paper, 
and wet with a cloth wrung out of cold water, when macaroons 
will easily slip off. 

Almond Macaroons 

Sprinkle Macaroons, before baking, with almonds blanched 
and shredded, or chopped. 



584 BOSTON COOKING-80HOOL COOJI BOOK 

Crescents 

X lb. almond paste Almonds, blanched and 

2 ozs. confectioners' sugar finely chopped 

White 1 small egg 

Mix same as Macaroons. Shape mixture, which is quite 
soft, in a long roll. Cut pieces from roll three-fourths inch 
long. Roll each separately in chopped nuts, at the same 
time shaping to form a crescent. Bake twenty minutes on a 
buttered tin sheet in a slow oven. Cool, and frost with Con- 
fectioners' Frosting, made thin enough to apply with a brush, 
and flavored with lemon juice until quite acid. Other nuts 
may be used in place of almonds. 

Cinnamon Bars 

10 ozs. almond paste White 1 egg 

5 ozs. confectioners' sugar % teaspoon cinnamon 

Mix same as Macaroons. Dredge a board with sugar, 

knead mixture slightly, and shape in a long roll. Pat, and 

roll one-fourth inch thick, using a rolling-pin. After rolling 

the piece should be four inches wide. Spread with frosting 

made of white of one egg and two-thirds cup confectioners* 

sugar beaten together until stiff enough to spread. Cut in 

strips four inches long by three-fourths inch wide. This must 

be quickly done, as a crust soon forms over frosting. To 

accomplish this, use two knives, one placed through mixture 

where dividing line is to be made, and the other used to 

make a clean sharp cut on both sides of first knife. Knives 

should be kept clean by wiping on a damp cloth. Remove 

strips as soon as cut, to a tin sheet, greased with lard and 

then floured. Bake twenty minutes on centre grate in a 

slow oven. 

Horseshoes 

Use Cinnamon Bar mixture. Cover with frosting colored 
with fruit red. Cut in strips six inches long by one-half 
inch wide. As soon as cut, shape quickly, at the same time 
carefully, in form of horseshoes. Bake same as Cinnamon 
Bars. When cool, make eight dots with chocolate frosting 
to represent nails.

Stuffed Dates I 

Make a cut the entire length of dates and remove stones. 
Fill cavities with castanea nuts, English walnuts, or blanched 
almonds, and shape in original form. Roll in granulated 
sugar. Pile in rows on a small plate covered with a doily. 
If castanea nuts are used, with a sharp knife cut off the 
brown skin which lies next to shell. 

Stuffed Dates II 

Remove stones from dates and fill cavities with Neufchatel 
cheese. 

Salted Almonds I 

Blanch one-fourth pound Jordan almonds and dry on a 
towel. Put one-third cup olive oil in a very small sauce- 
pan. When hot, put in one-fourth of the almonds and fry 
until delicately browned, stirring to keep almonds constantly 
in motion. Remove with a spoon or small skimmer, taking 
up as little oil as possible. Drain on brown paper and 
sprinkle with sail; repeat until all are fried. It may be 



686 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

necessary to remove some of the salt by wiping nuts with a 
napkin. 

Salted Almonda II 

Prepare almonds as for Salted Almonds I. Fry in one- 
third cup fat, using half lard and half clarified butter or all 
cocoanut butter. Drain, and sprinkle with salt 

Salted Peanuts 

In buying peanuts for salting, get those which have not 
been roasted. Remove skins and fry same as Salted 
Almonds I or II. 

Salted Pecans 

Shelled pecans may be bought by the pound, which is 
much the best way when used for salting, as it is difficult to 
remove the nut meat without breaking. Fry same as salted 
Almonds I or II. Care must be taken that they do not re- 
main in fat too long; having a dark skin, color does not 
determine when they are sufficiently cooked. 

Parisian Sweets 

1 lb. figs 1 lb. English walnut meat 

1 lb. dates Confectioners' sugar 

Pick over and remove stems from figs and stones from 
dates. Mix fruit with walnut meat, and force through a 
meat-chopper. Work, using the hands, on a board dredged 
with confectioners' sugar, until well blended. Roll to one- 
fourth inch thickness, using confectioners' sugar for dredg- 
ing board and pin. Shape with a small round cutter, first 
dipped in sugar, or cut with a sharp knife in three-fourth 
inch squares. Roll each piece in confectioners' sugar, and 
shake to remove superfluous sugar. Pack in layers in a tin 
box, putting paper between each layer. These confections 
may be used at dinner in place of bonbons or ginger chips. 
A combination of nut meat (walnut, almond, and filbert) 
may be used in equal proportions.

water. Bring to boiling-point, and let boil sixteen minutes. 
Pour over corn, and stir until every kernel is well coated 
with sugar. 

Molasses Candy 

2 cups Porto Rico molasses 3 tablespoons butter 
% cup sugar 1 tablespoon vinegar 

An iron kettle with a rounding bottom (Scotch kettle) or 
copper kettle is best for candy making. If one has no cop- 
per kettle, a granite kettle is best for sugar candies. 

Put butter in kettle, place over fire, and when melted, add 
molasses and sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. During 
the first of the boiling Stirling is unnecessary, but when 
nearly cooked, it should be constantly stirred. Boil until, 
when tried in cold water, mixture will become brittle. Add 
vinegar just before taking from fire. Pour into a well but- 
tered pan. When cool enough to handle, pull until porous 
and light-colored, allowing candy to come in contact with 
tips of fingers and thumbs, not to be squeezed in the hand. 
Cut in small pieces, using large shears or a sharp knife, and 
then arrange on slightly buttered plates to cool. 

Velvet Molasses Candy 

1 cup molasses 3 tablespoons vinegar 

3 cups sugar % teaspoon cream of tartar

platter, and when cool enough to handle, pull until light- 
colored. Shape on a floured board, having strip wide enough 
to enclose a roll of fondant one inch in diameter. Place 
fondant on candy, bring edges of candy together, and press 
firmly over fondant. With both hands pull candy into a 
long strip. Cut in small pieces ; each piece will consist of 
fondant encircled with molasses candy. Care must be taken 
that candy is not cooked too long, as it should be soft rather 
than brittle.

parts, and as soon as cool enough to handle shape in long 
rolls about one-third inch in diameter, keeping rolls in 
motion until almost cold. When cold, snap in pieces one 
and one- half inches long. This is done by holding roll 
at point to be snapped over the sharp edge of a broad- 
bladed knife and snapping. Melt confectioners' chocolate 
over hot water, beat with a fork until light and smooth, 
and when slightly cooled dip pieces in chocolate and with 
a two-tined fork or bonbon dipper remove from chocolate 
to oiled paper, drawing dipper through top of each the en-

BOILED SUGAR FOE CONFECTIONS 

Eleven tests are considered for boiling sugar : — 

Small thread, 215° F. The feather, 232© 

Large thread, 217° Soft ball, 238° 

Pearl, 220° Hardball, 248° 

Large pearl, 222° Small crack, 290° 

The blow, 230° Crack, 310° 

Caramel, 350° 

Fondant, the basis of all French candy, is made of sugar 
and water boiled together (with a small quantity of cream 
of tartar to prevent sugar from granulating) to soft ball, 238° 
F. The professional confectioner is able to decide wheu 
syrup has boiled to the right temperature by sound while 
boiling, and by testing in cold water; these tests at first 
seem somewhat difficult to the amateur, but only a little 
experience is necessary to make fondant successfully. A 
sugar thermometer is often employed, and proves valuable, 
as by its use one need not exercise his judgment. 

White Fondant 

1% lbs. sugar \)i cups hot water 

34 teaspoon cream of tartar 

Put ingredients into a smooth granite stewpan. Stir, 
place on range, and heat gradually to boiling point. Boil 
without stirring until, when tried in cold water, a soft ball 
may be formed that will just keep in shape, which is 238° F. 
After a few minutes' boiling, sugar will adhere to sides of 
kettle ; this should be washed off with the hand first 
dipped in cold water. Have a pan of cold water near at 



CONFECTIONS 545 

hand, dip hand in cold water, then quickly wash off a email 
part of the sugar with tips of fingers, and repeat until all 
sugar adhering to side of saucepan is removed. If this is 
quickly done, there is no danger of burning the fingers. 
Pour slowly on a slightly oiled marble slab. Let stand a few 
minutes to cool, but not long enough to become hard around 
the edge. Scrape fondant with chopping knife to one end of 
marble, and work with a wooden spatula until white and 
creamy. It will quickly change from this consistency, and 
begin to lump, when it should be kneaded with the hands 
until perfectly smooth. 

Put into a bowl, cover with oiled paper to exclude air, 
that a crust may not form on top, and let stand twenty-four 
hours. A large oiled platter and wooden spoon may be used 
in place of marble slab and spatula. Always make fondant 
on a clear day, as a damp, heavy atmosphere has an unfa- 
vorable effect on the boiling of sugar. 

Coffee Fondant 

2>£ lbs. sugar J£ cup ground coffee 

\% cups cold water )£ teaspoon cream of tartar 

Put water and coffee in saucepan, and heat to boiling- 
point Strain through double cheese-cloth ; then add sugar 
and cream of tartar. Boil, and work same as White Fondant. 

Maple Fondant 

1)4 lbs. maple sugar 1 cup hot water 

\% lbs. sugar % teaspoon cream of tartar 

Break maple sugar in pieces and add to remaining ingre- 
dients. Boil, and work same as White Fondant. 

Bonbons 

The centres of bonbons are made of fondant shaped in 
small balls. If White Fondant is used, flavor as desired, — 
vanilla being usually preferred. For cocoanut centres, work 
as much shredded coacoanut as possible into a small quantity 
of fondant ; for nut centres, surround pieces of nut meat with 
fondant, using just enough to cover. French candied cher- 



540 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

ries axe often used in this way. Allow halls to stand over 
night, and dip the following day. 

To Dip Bonbons. Put fondant in saucepan* and melt 
over hot water; color and flavor as desired. In coloring 
fondant, dip a small wooden skewer in coloring paste, take 
up a small quantity, and dip skewer in fondaut. if eare is 
not taken, the color is apt to be too intense. During dipping, 
keep fondant over hot water that it may be kepi of right 
consistency. For dipping, use a two-tined fork or confec- 
tioners' bonbon dipper. Drop -centres in fondant one at a 
time, stir until covered, remove from fondant, put on oiled 
paper, and bring end of dipper over the top of bonbon, Hi us 
leaving a tail-piece which shows that bonbons have been 
hand dipped. Stir fondaut between dippings to preyeat a 
crust from forming. 

Cream Mints 

Melt fondant over hot water, flavor with a few drops of 
oil of peppermint, wintergreen, clove, cinnamon, or orange, 
and color if desired. Drop from tip of spoon on oiled paper. 
Confectioners use rubber moulds for shaping cream mints ; 
but these are expensive for home use, unless one is to make 
mints in large quantities. 

Cream Nat Bars 

Melt fondant and flavor, stir in any kind of nut meat, cut 
in pieces. Turn in an oiled pan, cool, aud cut iu bars with 
a sbarp knife. Maple Fondant is delicious with nuts. 

Dipped 'Walnuts 

Melt fondant and flavor. Dip halves of walnuts as bon- 
bon centres are dipped. Halves of pecan or whole blanched 
almonds may be similarly dipped. 

Tutti-Frutti Candy 

Fill an oiled border mould with three layers of melted 
fondant. Have bottom layer maple, well mixed with Eng- 
lish walnut meat; the second layer colored pink, flavored 



CONFECTIONS 547 

with rose, and mixed with candied cherries cut in quarters 
and figs finely chopped ; the third layer white, flavored with 
vanilla, mixed with nuts* candied cherries cut in quarters, 
and candied pineapple cut in small pieces. Cover mould 
with oiled paper, and let stand over night* Remove from 
mould, and place on a plate covered with a lace paper 
napkin. Fill centre with Bonbons and Glace' Nuts. 

Glace* Nuts 
2 cops sugar 1 cup boiling water 

% teaspoon cream of tartar 

Put ingredients in a smooth saucepan, stir, place on 
range, and heat to boiling-point. Boil without stirring until 
syrup begins to discolor, which is 310° F. Wash off sugar 
which adheres to sides of saucepan, as in making fondant. 
Remove saucepan from fire, and place in larger pan of cold 
water to instantly stop boiling. Remove from cold water 
and place in a saucepan of hot water during dipping. Take 
nuts separately on a long pin, dip in syrup to cover, remove 
from syrup, and place on oiled paper. 

Glac6 Fruits 

For Glace* Fruits, grapes, strawberries, sections of man- 
darins and oranges, and candied cherries are most commonly 
used. Take grapes separately from clusters, leaving a short 
stem on each grape. Dip in syrup made as for Glace Nuts, 
holding by stem with pincers. Remove to oiled paper. Glace 
fruits keep but a day, and should only be attempted in cold 
and clear weather. 

Candied Orange Peel 

Remove peel from four thin-skinned oranges in quarters. 
Cover with cold water, bring to boiling-point, and cook 
slowly until soft. Drain, remove white portion, using a 
spoon, and cut yellow portion in thin strips, using scissors. 
Boil one-half cup water and one cup sugar until syrup will 
thread when dropped from tip of spoon. Cook strips in 
syrup five minutes, drain, and coat with fine granulated 
sugar. 



548 BOSTON OOOKING-SOHOOL COOK BOOK 

Spun Sugar 

2 lbs. sugar 2 cups boiling water 

J£ teaspoon cream of tartar 

Pat ingredients in a smooth saucepan. Boil without stir- 
ring until syrup begins to discolor, which is 300° F. Wash 
off sugar which adheres to sides of saucepan, as in making 
fondant. Remove saucepan from fire, and place in a larger 
pan of cold water to instantly stop boiling. Remove from 
cold water, and place in saucepan of hot water. Place two 
broomstick-handles over backs of chairs, and spread paper 
on the floor under them. When syrup is slightly cooled, 
put dipper in syrup, remove from syrup, and shake quickly 
back and forth over broomhandles. Carefully take off spun 
sugar as soon as formed, and shape in nests, or pile lightly 
on a cold dish. Syrup may be colored if desired. Spun 
Sugar is served around bricks or moulds of frozen creams 
and ices. 

Dippers for spinning sugar are made of coarse wires; 
about twenty wires, ten inches long, are put in a bundle, 
and fastened with wire coiled round and round to form a 
handle.

CHAPTER XXXIV 
8AHDW1CHBS AM) CANAPES 

IN preparing bread for sandwiches, cut slices as thinly as 
possible, and remove crusts. If butter is used, cream 
the butter, and spread bread before cutting from loaf. 
Spread half the slices with mixture to be used for filling, 
cover with remaining pieces, and cut in squares, oblongs, or 
triangles. If sandwiches are shaped with round or fancy 
cutters, bread should be shaped before spreading, that there 
may be no waste of butter. Sandwiches which are prepared 
several hours before serving-time may be kept fresh and 
moist by wrapping in a napkin wrung as dry as possible out 
of hot water, and keeping in a cool place. Paraffin e paper 
is often used for the same purpose. Bread for sandwiches 
cuts better when a day old. Serve sandwiches piled on a 
plate covered with a doily. 

Rolled Bread 

Cut fresh bread, while still warm, in as thin slices as pos- 
sible, using a very sharp knife. Spread evenly with butter 
which has been creamed. Roll slices separately, and tie 
each with baby ribbon. 

Bread and Butter Folds 

Remove end slice from bread. Spread end of loaf spar- 
ingly and evenly with butter which has been creamed. Cut 
off as thin a slice as possible. Repeat until the number of 
slices required are prepared. Remove crusts, put together 
in pairs, and cut in squares, oblongs, or triangles. Use 
white, entire wheat, Graham, or brown bread. Three layer 
sandwiches are attractive when made of entire wheat bread 
between white slices.

CHAPTER XXXV 
KECIPES FOB THE CHAFING-DISH 

THE chafing-dish, which, within the last few years, has 
gained so much favor, is by no means a utensil of 
modern invention, as its history may be traced to the time 
of Louis XIV. It finds its place on the breakfast table, 
when the eggs may be cooked to suit the most fastidious; 
on the luncheon table, when a dainty hot dish may be pre- 
pared to serve in place of the so-oft seen cold meat; but it 
is made of greatest use for the cooking of late suppers, and 
always seems to accompany hospitality and good cheer. 

It is appreciated and enjoyed by the housekeeper who 
does her own work, or has but one maid, as well as by the 
society girl who, by its use, first gains a taste for the art of 
cooking. The simple tin chafing-dishes may be bought for 
as small a sum as ninety cents, while the elaborate silver 
ones command as high a price as one hundred dollars. Very 
attractive dishes are made of granite ware, nickel, or copper. 
The latest patterns have the lamp with a screw adjustment 
to regulate the flame, and a metal tray on which to set disb : 
that it may be moved if necessary while hot, without danger 
of burnt fingers, and that it may not injure the polished 
table. 

A chafing-dish has two pans, the under one for holding 
hot water, the upper one with long handle for holding food 
to be cooked. A blazer differs from a chafing-dish, inas- 
much as it has no hot-water pan. 

Wood alcohol, which is much lower in price than high-proof 
spirits, is generally used in chafing-dishes. 

The Davy Toaster may be used over the chafing-dish for 
toasting bread and broiling.

CHAPTER XXXVI 
FRUITS: FRESH, PRESERVED, AND CANNED 

FRUITS are usually at their best when served ripe and 
in season; however, a few cannot be taken in their 
raw state, and still others are rendered more easy of diges- 
tion by cooking. The methods employed are stewing and 
baking. Fruit should be cooked in earthen or granite ware 
utensils, and silver or wooden spoons shonld be employed 
for stirring. It must be remembered that all fruits contain 
one or more acids, and when exposed to air and brought in 
contact with an iron or tin surface, a poisonous compound 
may be formed. 

How to Prepare Strawberries for Serving 

1. Pick over strawberries, place in colander, pour over 
cold water, drain thoroughly, hull, and turn into dish. Serve 
with powdered sugar and cream. 

2. Pick over selected strawberries, place in colander, pour 
over cold water, and drain thoroughly. Press powdered 
sugar into cordial glasses. Remove from glasses on centres 
of fruit plates. Arrange twelve berries around each mound 
of sugar. Berries served in this way should not be 
hulled. 

$Xow to Prepar* <?an$aloupes and Muskm&lona for gerviflg 

Canteloupes and muskmeions should be very ripe and 
thoroughly chilled in ice box before being prepared for 
serving. Wipe mejons, — if small., cut in halves lengthwise ; if 
larger, cut in sections, and remove seeds and stringy portion. 
If one-half is served as a portion, put in cavity one table- 
spoon crushed ice. Serve with salt or powdered sugar.

How to Prepare Grapes for Serving 

Put bunches in colander and pour over cold water, drain, 
chill, and arrange on serving dish. Imperfect grapes, as 
wel} as those under-ripe or over-ripe, should be removed. 
Garnish with grape leaves, if at hand. 

Ways of Preparing Oranges for Serving 

1. Wipe orange and cut in halves crosswise. Place one- 
half on a fruit plate, having an orange spoon or teaspoon on 
plate at right of fruit. 

2. Peel an orange and remove as much of the white por- 
tion as possible. Remove pulp by sections, which may be 
accomplished by using a sharp knife and cutting pulp from 
tough portion first on one side of section, then on the other. 
Should there be any white portion of skin remaining on pulp 
it should be cut off. Arrange sections on glass dish or fruit 
plate. If the orange is a seeded one, remove seeds. 

3. Remove peel from an orange in such a way that there 
remains a one-half inch band of peel equal distance from 
stem and blossom end. Cut band, separate sections, and 
arrange around a mould of sugar. 

How to Prepare Grape Fruit for Serving 

Wipe grape fruit and cut in halves crosswise. With a 
8m all, sharp-pointed knife make a cut separating pulp from 
skin around entire circumference ; then make cuts separating 
pulp from tough portion which divides fruit into sections. 
Remove tough portion in one piece, which may be accom- 
plished by one cutting with scissors at stem or blossom end 
close to skin. Sprinkle fruit pulp left in grape fruit skin 
generously with sugar. Let stand ten minutes, and serve 
very cold. Place on fruit plate and garnish with a candied 
cherry. 

Grape Fruit with Sherry 

Prepare grape fruit for serving, add to each portion one 
tablespoon Sherry wine, and let stand one hour in ice box or 
cold place.

Grape Fruit 'with Apricot Brandy 

Prepare grape fruit for serving and add to each portion 
one-half tablespoon apricot brandy. 

Grape Fruit with Sloe Gin 

Prepare grape fruit for serving and add to each portion 
oue-half tablespoon sloe gin. 

Fruit Cocktail 

Remove pulp from grape fruit, and mix with shredded 
pineapple, bananas cut in slices and slices cut in quarters, 
and strawberries cut in halves, using half as much pine- 
apple and banana as grape fruit, and allowing four straw- 
berries to each serve. There should be two cups fruit. 
Pour over a dressing made of one-third cup Sherry wine, 
three tablespoons apricot brandy, one-half cup sugar, and a 
few grains salt. Chill thoroughly, serve in double cocktail 
glasses, and garnish with candied cherries and leaves. 

Baked Apples 

Wipe and core sour apples. Put in a baking-dish, and fill 
cavities with sugar and spice. Allow one -half cup sugar 
and one-fourth teaspoon cinnamon or nutmeg to eight apples. 
If nutmeg is used, a few drops lemon juice and few gratings 
from rind of lemon to each apple is an improvement. Cover 
bottom of dish with boiling water, and bake in a hot oven 
until soft, basting often with syrup in dish. Serve hot or 
cold with cream. Many prefer to pare apples .before bak- 
ing. When this is done, core before paring, that fruit may 
keep in shape. In the fail, when apples are at their best, 
do not add spices to apples, as their flavor cannot be im- 
proved ; but towards spring they become somewhat taste- 
less, and spice is an improvement. 

Baked Sweet Apples 

Wipe and core eight sweet apples. Put in a baking-dish, 
and fill cavities with sugar, allowing one-third cup, or 
sweeten with molasses. Add two-thirds cup boiling water.

Cover, and bake three hours in a slow oven, adding more 
water if necessary. 

Apple Sauce 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare eight sour apples. Make a 
syrup by boiling seven minutes one cup sugar and one cup 
water with thin shaving from rind of a lemon. Remove 
lemon, add enough apples to cover bottom of saucepan, 
watch carefully during cooking, and remove as soon as soft 
Continue until all are cooked. Strain remaining syrup over 
apples. 

Spioed Apple Battbe 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare eight sour' apples. Put in 
a saucepan, sprinkle with one cup sugar, add eight cloves, 
and enough water to prevent apples from burning. Cook to 
a mush, stirring occasionally. 

Apple Ginger 

Wipe, quarter, core, pare, and chop sour apples; there 
should be two and one-half pounds. Put in a stewpan 
and add one and one-half pounds light brown sugar, juice 
and rind of one and one-half lemons, one-half ounce ginger 
root, a few grains salt, and enough water to prevent apples 
from burning. Cover, and cook slowly four hours, adding 
water as necessary. Apple Ginger may be kept for several 
weeks. 

Apple Porcupine 

Make a syrup by boiling eight minutes one and one- half 
cups sugar and one and one-half cups water. Wipe, core, 
and pare eight apples. Put apples in syrup as soon as pared, 
that they may not discolor. Cook until soft, occasionally 
skimming syrup during cooking. Apples cook better cov- 
ered with the syrup; therefore it is better to use a deep 
saucepan and have two cookings. Drain apples from syrup, 
cool, fill cavities with jelly, marmalade, or preserved fruit, 
and stick apples with almonds blanched and split in halres 
lengthwise. Serve with Cream Sauce L

Cranberry Sauce • 

Pick over and wash three cups cranberries. Put in % 
stewpan, add one and one-fourth caps sugar and one cap 
boiling water. Cover, and boil ten minutes. Care must be 
taken that they do not boil over. Skim and cool. 

Cranberry Jelly 

Pick over and wash four cups cranberries. Put in a ate*- 
pan with one cup boiling water, and boil twenty minutes. 
Rub through a sieve, add two cups sugar, and cook fto 
minutes. Turn into a mould or glasses. 

Stewed Prunes 

Wash and pick over prunes. Put in a saucepan, covet 
with cold water, and soak two hours ; then cook until soft 
in same water. When nearly cooked, add sugar or mol&sa& 
to sweeten. Many prefer the addition of a small quantity of 
lemon juice. 

Rhubarb Sauce 

Peel and cut rhubarb in one-inch pieces. Put in a sauce 
pan, sprinkle generously with sugar, and add enough water 
to prevent rhubarb from burning. Rhubarb contains such i 
large percentage of water that but little additional water is 
needed. Cook until soft If rhubarb is covered with bod- 
ing water, allowed to stand five minutes, then drained and 
cooked, less sugar will be required. Rhubarb is sometimes 
baked in an earthen pudding-dish. If baked slowly for a 
long time it has a rich red color. 



JELLIES 

Jellies are made of cooked fruit juice and sugar, in neari; 
all cases the proportions being equal. Where failures occe 
they may usually be traced to the use of too ripe fruit.

ually to boiling-point. Remove glasses, and drain. Place 
glasses while filling on a cloth wrung out of hot water. 

To Cover Jelly Glasses. Cut letter paper in circular 
pieces just to fit in top of glasses. Dip in brandy, and cover 
jelly. Put on tin covers or circular pieces of paper cut 
larger than the glasses, and fastened securely over the edge 
with mucilage. Some prefer to cover jelly with melted 
paraffine then to adjust covers. 

To Make a Jelly Bag. Fold two opposite corners of a piece 
of cotton and wool flannel three-fourths yard long. Sew up 
in the form of a cornucopia, rounding at the end. Fell the 
seam to make more secure. Bind the top with tape, and fur- 
nish with two or three heavy loops by which it may be hung. 

Apple Jelly 

Wipe apples, remove stem and blossom ends, and cut in 
quarters. Put in a granite or porcelain-lined preserving ket- 
tle, . and add cold water to come nearly to top of apples. 
Cover, and cook slowly until apples are soft; mash, and 
drain through a coarse sieve. Avoid squeezing apples, which 
makes jelly cloudy. Then allow juice to drip through a 
double thickness of cheese-cloth or a jelly bag. Boil twenty 
minutes, and add an equal quantity of heated sugar; boil 
five minutes, skim, and turn in glasses. Put in a sunny win- 
dow, and let stand twenty-four hours. Cover, and keep in a 
cool, dry place. Porter apples make a delicious flavored 
jelly. If apples are pared, a much lighter jelly may be 
made. Gravenstein apples make a very spicy jelly. 

To Heat Sugar. Put in a granite dish, place in oven, 
leaving oven door ajar, and stir occasionally. 

Quince Jelly 

Follow recipe for Apple Jelly, using quinces in place of 

apples, and removing seeds from fruit. Quince parings are

Currant Jelly- 
Currants are in the best condition for making jelly between 
June twenty-eighth and July third* and should not be picked 
directly after a rain. Cherry currants make the best jelly. 
Equal proportions of red and white currants are considered 
desirable, and make a lighter colored jelly. 

Pick over currants, but do not remove stems j wash and 
drain. Mash a few in the bottom of a preserving kettle, 
using a wooden potato masher ; so continue until berries are 
used. Cook slowly until currants look white. Strain through 
a course strainer, then allow juice to drop through a double 
thickness of cheese-cloth or a jelly bag. Measure, bring to 
boiling-point, and boil five minutes ; add an equal measure 
of heated sugar, boil three minutes, skim, and pour into 
glasses. Place in a sunny window, and let stand tweflty-

inch pieces. Heat to boiling-point, and boil one-half hour; 
then add four pounds cut sugar and cut rind. Cook slowly 
two hours. Turn into glasses. 

Quince Honey 

Pare and grate five large quinces. To one pint boiling 
water add five pounds sugar. Stir over fire until sugar is 
dissolved, add quince, and cook fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Turn into glasses. When cold it should be about the color 
and consistency of honey. 

CANNING AND PRESERVING 

Preserving fruit is cooking it with from three-fourths to its 
whole weight of sugar. By so doing, much of the natural 
flavor of the fruit is destroyed ; therefore canning is usually 
preferred to preserving. 

Canning fruit is preserving sterilized fruit in sterilized air- 
tight jars , the sugar being added to give sweetness. Fruits 
may be canned without sugar if perfectly sterilized, that is, 
freed from all germ life. 

Directions for Canning 

Fruit for canning should be fresh, firm, of good quality, 
and not over-ripe ; if over-ripe, some of the spores may sur- 
vive the boiling, then fermentation will take place in a short 

time. 

For canning fruit, allow one-third its weight in sugar, 
and two and one-half to three cups water to each pound of 
sugar. Boil sugar and water ten minutes to make a thin; 



578 BG8T0N COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

syrup ; then cook a small quantity of the fruit at a time in 
the syrup ; by so doing, fruit may be kept in perfect shape. 
Hard fruits, like pineapple and quince, are cooked in boiling 
water until nearly soft, then put in syrup to finish cooking. 
Sterilized jars are then filled with fruit, and enough syrup 
added to overflow jars. If there is not sufficient syrup, add 
boiling water, as jars must be filled to overflow. Introduce 
a spoon between fruit and jar, that air bubbles may rise to 
the top and break ; then quickly put on rubbers and screw 
on sterilized covers. Let stand until cold, again screw cov- 
ers, being sure this time that jars are air-tight. While filling 
jars, place them on a cloth wrung out of hot water. 

To Sterilise Jars 

Wash jars and fill with cold water. Set in a kettle on a 
trivet, and surround with cold water. Heat gradually to 
boiling-point, remove from water, empty, and fill while hot. 
Put covers in hot water and let stand five minutes. Dip rub- 
ber bands in hot water, but do not allow them to stand. 
New rubbers should be used each season, and care must be 
taken that rims of covers are not bent, as jars cannot then 
be hermetically sealed. 

Canned Porter Apples 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare Porter apples, then weigh. 
Make a syrup by boiling for ten minutes one-third their 
weight in sugar with water, allowing two and one-half 
cups to each pound of sugar. Cook apples in syrup until 
soft, doing a few at a time. Fill jars, following Directions 



for Canning. 



Canned Peaches 



Wipe peaches and put in boiling water, allowing them to 
stand just long enough to easily loosen skins. Remove skins 
and cook fruit at once, that it may not discolor, following 
Directions for Canning. Some prefer to pare peaches, 
sprinkle with sugar, and let stand over night. In morning 
drain, add water to fruit syrup, bring to boiling-point;, and 
then cook fruit. Peaches may be cut in halves, or smaller 
pieces if desired. 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 579 

Canned Pears 

Wipe and pare fruit. Cook whole with stems left on, or 
remove stems, cut in quarters, and core. Follow Directions 
for Canning. A small piece of ginger root or a few slicings 
of lemon rind may be cooked with syrup. Bartlett pears are 
the best for canning. 

Canned Pineapples 

Remove skin and eyes from pineapples ; then cut in half- 
inch slices, and slices in cubes, at the same time discarding 
the core. Follow Directions for Canning. Pineapples may be 
shredded and cooked in one-half their weight of sugar with- 
out water, and then put in jars. When put up in this way 
they are useful for the making of sherbets and fancy des- 
serts* 

Canned Quinces 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare quinces. Follow Directions 
for Canning. Quinces may be cooked with an equal weight 
of sweet apples wiped, quartered, cored, and paired ; in this 
case use no extra sugar for apples. 

Canned Cherries 

Use large white or red cherries. Wash, remove stems, 
then follow Directions for Canning. 

Canned Huckleberries 

Pick over and wash berries, then put in a preserving ket- 
tle with a small quantity of water to prevent berries from 
burning. Cook until soft, stirring occasionally, and put 
in jars. No sugar is required, but a sprinkling of salt is 
an agreeable addition. 

Canned Rhubarb 

Pare rhubarb and cut in one-inch pieces. Pack in a jar, 
put under cold water faucet, and let water run twenty min- 
utes, then screw on cover. Rhubarb canned in this way has 
often been known to keep a year.

Canned Tomatoes 

Wipe tomatoes, cover with boiling water, and let stand 
until skins may be easily removed. Cut in pieces and cook

jars, following directions given. 

Damson Preserves 

Wipe damsons with a piece of cheese-cloth wrung out 
of cold water, and prick each fruit five or six times, using 
a large needle ; then weigh. Make a syrup by boiling three- 
fourths their weight in sugar with water, allowing one cap to 
each pound of sugar. As soon as syrup reaches boiling- 
point, skim, and add plums, a few at a time, that fruit may 
better keep in shape during cooking. Cook until soft It is 
well to use two kettles, that work may be more quickly done, 
and syrup need not cook too long a time. Put into glass or 
stone jars. 

Strawberry Preserves 

Pick over, wash, drain, and hull strawberries ; then weigh. 
Fill glass jars with berries. Make a syrup same as for 
Damson Preserve, cooking the syrup fifteen minutes. Add 
syrup to overflow jars ; let stand fifteen minutes, when fruit 
will have shrunk, and more fruit must be added to fill jars. 
Screw on covers, put on a trivet in a kettle of cold water, 
heat water to boiling-point, and keep just below boiling-point 
one hour. 

Raspberries may be preserved in the same way. 

Pear Chips

To Scald Milk. Put in top of double boiler, having 
water boiling in under part Cover, and let stand on top of 
range until milk around edge of double boiler has a bead- 
like appearance. 

For Buttered Craoker Crumbs, allow from one- fourth to 
one-third cup melted butter to each cup of crumbs. Stir 
lightly with' a fork in mixing, that crumbs may be evenly 
coated and light rather than compact. 

To Cream Butter. Put in a bowl and work with a wooden 
spoon until soft and of creamy consistency. Should butter- 
milk exude from butter it should be poured off. 

To Extract Juice from Onion. Cut a slice from root end 
of onion, draw back the skin, and press onion on a coarse 
grater, working with a rotary motion. 

To Chop Parsley. Remove leaves from parsley. If 
parsley is wet, first dry in a towel. Gather parsley between 
thumb and fingers and press compactly. With a sharp 
vegetable knife cut through and through. Again gather in 
fingers and recut, so continuing until parsley is finely cut. 

To Caramelize Sugar. Put in a smooth grauite saucepan 
or omelet pan, place over hot part of range, and stir con- 
stantly until melted and of the color of maple syrup. Cw 
must be taken to prevent sugar from adhering to sides of

it Add an equal quantity of boiling water, and simmer 
until of the consistency of a thick syrup. Of use in coloring 
soups, sauces, etc. 

Acidulated Water is water to which vinegar or lemon 
juice is added One tablespoon of the acid is allowed to 
one quart water. 

To Blanch Almonds. Cover Jordan almonds with boiling

and put in an omelet pan, allowing one-half teaspoon butter 
to each cup chestnuts. Shake over range until butter is 
melted. Put in oven and let stand five minutes. Remove 
from oven, and with a small knife take off shells. By this 
method shelling and blanching is accomplished at the same 
time, as skins adhere to shells. 

Flavoring Bxtraots and Wine should be added if possible 
to a mixture when cold. If added while mixture is hot, 
much of the goodness passes off with the steam. 

Meat Glaze. Four quarts stock reduced to one cup.

To Wash Mirrors and Windows. Rub over with chamois 
skin wrung out of warm water, then wipe with a piece of dry 
chamois skin. This method saves much strength. 

To Remove White Spots from Furniture. Dip a cloth 
in hot water nearly to boiling-point. Place over spot, remove 
quickly, and rub over spot with a dry cloth. Repeat if spot 
is not removed. Alcohol or camphor quickly applied may 
be used. 

Tumblers which have contained milk should be first rinsed 
in cold water before washing in hot water. 

To keep a Sink Drain free from grease, pour down once 
a week at night one-half can Babbitt's potash dissolved in 
one quart water. 

Should Sink Drain chance to get choked, pour into sink 
one-fourth pound copperas dissolved in two quarts boiling 
water. If this is not efficacious, repeat before sending for a 
plumber. 

Never put Knives with ivory handles in water. Hot water 
causes them to crack and discolor. 



HELPFUL HINTS FOR THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER 589 

To prevent Glassware from being easily broken, put in a 
kettle of cold water, heat gradually until water baa reached 
boiling-point. Set aside ; when water is cold take out glass. 
This is a most desirable way to toughen lamp chimneys. 

To Remove Grease Spots. Cold water and Ivory Soap 
will remove grease spots from cotton and woollen fabrics. 
Castilian Cream is useful for black woollen goods, but leaves 
a light ring on delicately colored goods. Ether is always sure 
and safe to use. 

To Remove Iron Rust. Saturate spot with lemon juice, 
then cover with salt. Let stand in the sun for several hours; 
or a solution of hydrochloric acid may be used. 

Iron Rust may be removed from delicate fabrics by cov- 
ering spot thickly with cream of tartar, then twisting cloth 
to keep cream of tartar over spot ; put in a saucepan of cold 
water, and heat water gradually to boiling-point. 

To Remove Grass Stains from cotton goods, wash in 
alcohol. 

To Remove Ink Stains. Wash in a solution of hydro- 
chloric acid, and rinse in ammonia water. Wet the spot 
with warm water, put on Sapolio, rub gently between the 
hands, and generally the spot will disappear. 

Cut Glass should be washed and rinsed in water that is 
not very hot and of same temperature. 

In Sweeping Carpets, keep broom close to floor and work 
with the grain of the carpet. Occasionally turn broom that 
it may wear evenly. 

Tie Strands of a New Broom closely together, put into 
a pail of boiling water, and soak two hours. Dry thoroughly 
before using. 

Never wash the inside of Tea or Coffee Pots with soap- 
suds. If granite or agate ware is used, and becomes badly 
discolored, nearly fill pot with cold water, add one table- 
spoon borax, and heat gradually until water reaches the boil-

ing-point. Rinse with hot water, wipe, and keep on back of 
range until perfectly dry. 

Never put cogs of a Dover Egg-beater in water. 

Never wash Bread Boards in a sink. . Scrub with grain of 
wood, using a small brush. 

Before using a new Iron Kettle, grease inside and outside, 
and let stand forty -eight hours ; then wash in hot water in 
which a large lump of cooking soda has been dissolved. 

To clean a Copper Boiler, use Putz Pomade Cream. Ap- 
ply with a woollen cloth when boiler is warm, not hot ; then 
rub off with second woollen cloth and polish with flannel or 
chamois. If badly tarnished, use oxalic acid. Faucets and 
brasses are treated in the same way. 

A bottle containing Oxalic Acid should be marked poison, 
and kept on a high shelf. 

To keep an Ice Chest in good condition, wash thoroughly 
once a week with cold or lukewarm water in which washing 
soda has been dissolved. If by chance anything is spilt in 
an ice chest, it should be wiped off at once. 

Milk and butter very quickly absorb odors, and if in ice 
chest with other foods, should be kept closely covered. 

Hard Wood Floors and Furniture may be polished by 
using a small quantity of kerosene oil applied with a woollen 
cloth, then rubbing with a clean woollen cloth. A very good 
furniture polish is made by using equal parts linseed oil and 
turpentine. 

Polish for Hard Wood Floors. Use one part beeswax 
to two parts turpentine. Put in saucepan on range, and 
when wax is dissolved a paste will be formed. 

To clean Piano Keys, rub over with alcohol. 

To remove old Tea and Coffee Stains, wet spot with cold 
water, cover with glycerine, and let stand two or three hours. 
Then wash with cold water and hard soap. Repeat it 
necessary. 



HELPFUL HINT8 FOB THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER 691 

Before Sweeping Old Carpets, sprinkle with pieces of 
newspaper wrung out of water. After sweeping, wipe over 
with a cloth wrung out of a weak solution of ammonia water, 
which seems to brighten colors* 

Piatt's Chloride is one of the best Disinfectants. Chloride 
of lime is a valuable disinfectant, and much cheaper than 
Piatt's Chloride. 

Listerine is an excellent disinfectant to use for the mouth 
and throat 

To Make a Pastry Bag. Fold a twelve-inch square of 
rubber cloth from two opposite corners. Sew edges together, 
forming a triangular bag. Cut off point to make opening 
large enough to insert a tin pastry tube. A set comprising 
bag and twelve adjustable tubes may be bought for two and 
one-half dollars. 

Smoked Ceilings may be cleaned by washing with cloths 
wrung out of water in which a small piece of washing soda 
has been dissolved. 

For a Burn apply equal parts of white of egg and olive 
oil mixed together, then cover with a piece of old linen ; if 
applied at once no blister will form. Or apply at once cook- 
ing soda, then cover with cloth and keep the same wet with 
cold water. This takes out the pain and prevents blistering. 

Curtain and Portiere Poles allow the hangings to slip 
easily if rubbed with hard soap. This is much better than 
greasing. 

Creaking Doors and Drawers should be treated in the 
same way. 

To Remove Dust from Rattan Furniture use a painter's 
small brush.

A Full Course Dinner 

First Course 

Little Neck Clams or Bluepoints, with brown-bread sand- 
wiches. Sometimes canape's are used in place of either. For 
a gentleman's dinner, canape's accompanied with Sherry wine 
are frequently served before guests enter the dining-room. 

Second Course 

Clear soup, with bread sticks, small rolls, or crisp crackers. 
Where two soups are served, one may be a cream soup. 
Cream 6bups are served with croutons. Radishes, celery, or 
olives are passed after the soup. Salted almonds may be 
passed between any of the courses. 



A FULL COURSE DINNER 601 

Third Course 
Bouche'es or rissoles. The filling to be of light meat. 

Fourth Course 

Fish, baked, boiled, or fried. Cole slaw, dressed cucum- 
bers, or tomatoes accompany this course; with fried fish 
potatoes are often served. 

Fifth Course 
Roast saddle of venison or mutton, spring lamb, or fillet 
of beef ; potatoes and one other vegetable. 

Sixth Course 
Entree, made of light meat or fish. 

Seventh Course 

A vegetable. Mushrooms, cauliflower, asparagus, or arti- 
chokes are served. 

Eighth Course 
Punch or cheese course. Punch, when served, always 
precedes the game course. 

Ninth Course 
Game, with vegetable salad, usually lettuce or celery ; or 
cheese sticks may be served with the salad, and game omitted. 

Tenth Course 
Dessert, usually cold. 

Eleventh Course 
Frozen dessert and fancy cakes. Bonbons are passed 
after this course. 

Twelfth Course 

Cracker, cheese, and cafe* noir. Cafe* noir is frequently 
served in the drawing and smoking rooms after the dinner. 

Where wines and liquors are served, the first course is not 
usually accompanied by either ; but if desired, Sauterne or 
other white wine may be used. 

With soup, serve Sherry ; with fish, white wine ; with 
game, Claret ; with roast and other courses, Champagne. 



602 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

After serving cafe* noir in drawing-room, pass pony of 
brandy for men, sweet liqueur (Chartreuse, Benedictine, or 
Parfait d' Amour) for women ; then Cr£me de Menthe for all. 

After a short time Apollinaris should be passed. White 
wines should be served cool; Sherry should be as near the 
temperature of the room in which it is served as possible. 
Champagne should be served very cold by allowing it to 
remain in salt and ice at least one-half hour before dinner 
time. Claret, served without cooling, and as it contains so 
small amount of alchohol, is not good the day after opening. 

For a simpler dinner, the third, seventh, eighth, and tenth 
courses, and the game in the ninth course, may be omitted. 

For a home dinner, it is always desirable to serve for first 
course a soup; second course, meat or fish, with potatoes 
and two other vegetables; third course, a' vegetable salad, 
with French dressing ; fourth course, dessert ; fifth course, 
crackers, cheese, and cafe' noir. 

At a ladies' luncheon the courses are as many as at a 
small dinner. In winter, grape fruit is sometimes served 
in place of oysters; in summer, selected strawberries in 
small Swedish Timbale cases.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF COURSES 

The aim of this School is to afford such instruction as will 
elevate cookery to its proper place as a science and an art. 
The courses are so arranged, combining the practical and 
the theoretical, that the knowledge gained may be applied 
to daily living. The needs of the body are not forgotten. 
The classification, composition, and nutritive value of foods 
are considered. The correct proportion of each of the food- 
principles necessary for a day's ration, for those of different 
age, sex, and occupation, is emphasized, thus enabling the 
pupil to arrange well-balanced dietaries. Attention is paid 
to the selection of supplies. with reference to economy and 
utility, thus tending to develop an interest in marketing and 
accounts
