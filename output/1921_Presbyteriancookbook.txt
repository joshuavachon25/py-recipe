PREFACE. 

The Ladies Aid Society of the First Presbyterian Church com- 
piled the first edition of the "Presbyterian Cook Book" in April, 
1905. 

Since that date 2500 books have been sold. The last edition 
was exhausted more than two years ago, still the demand continues. 
And so earnest has been the request, and from so many sources, 
even from other states, that the Society has now placed on sale thft 
fourth edition. 

In arranging these pages the ladies have endeavored to fur- 
nish simple, practical, well-balanced recipes with special attention 
to economy to meet the present high cost of living. 

In most cases the matter has been inserted as received, where 
condensed it has been to save space. 

In this book some material has been omitted in order to make 
room for new contributions. The Steeleville department has been 
arranged under the classified headings of the book. 

We heartily thank those who have so willingly furnished re- 
cipes or in any way assisted in the compilation of the book.

HOME CANNING BY THE COLD-PACK METHOD. 

The following instructions are taken from Farmer's Bulletin 
8o9 which '.an be obtained from the U. -3. Department of Agricui- 
tu.e, Washington, D. C, care of Publications Di.v 

"Those engaged in the work should start with clean hands, 
clean utensils, clean, sound, fresh products, and pure, clean soft 
water. No vegetables or fruit which are withered or unsouna 
should be canned. If po.^sible, only fruits and vegetables picked 
the day of canning should be used. Peas and corn, which lose their 
flavor rapidly, should be canned within five hours after gathering. 
The jars for canning should be placed in a ves:el of cold water over 
a fire to heat while products are being prepared to insure their 
being thoroughly heated when needed. 

The canning proceedure for most products consists of five 
teps — scalding or blanching, cold-dipping, packing, processing, and 
sealing. With berries and soft fruits the blanching is dispensed 
with. 

To blanch, place the product in a cheesecloth bag or dipping 
basket into boiilng water and allow to remain from one to fifteen 
minutes depending on the kind of product. Next dip it into clean 
cold water and remove. Pack carefully into hot pars adding hot 
water and salt for seasoning- The scalded rubbers and tops of jars 
are put into place; after turning the lid tight reverse it one-quarter 
round to allow for expansion. Then place in hot-water bath foi 
processing, the length of time being determined by accompanying 
table. Immediately after the termination of the processing period 
while products are still hot, remove from container and seal very 
tightly. Jars should then be turned upside down to cool closely ex- 
amined for leak;. If leakage occurs covers should then be tightened 
until completely closed. If defective rubbers are found the contents 
must be replaced in container and reheated after new rubbers are 
fitted. 

Homemade outfits are as good ag commercial if properly made 
with false bottom to prevent direct contact with heat from below. 
Have the hot water cover tops of jars at least one inch. Count 
time as soon as the wa^er begins to boil vigorously. Remove jars 
and tighten covers as soon as time is up.
