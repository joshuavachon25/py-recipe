Bread 

Mrs. Charlhs Xiolson. 



"And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort yo your 
lu-arls; after that ye shall pass on."— Genesis 1S:5. 



In the iiiakiii^' of ^ood bread there is nothino" 
intricate or dillicult, nothing- which an}- person of 
average intelligence cannot understand, hut there* 
,iss liQ department of cooking where so ninch de- 
pends upon care in little details, and where fail- 
ure 5^0 surely follows any deviation from certain 
well established principles. 

Good Hour, good veast, pure water and sweet 
milk are the first essentials to making good bread. 
Flour should always "be sifted before measuring 
and if kept in a cold pantry, it should bs warmed 
before using. x».Iilk and water should also be 
warm. 

There are various ways of making l)read, with 
milk, water, potatoes, etc., but the tvv^o points, 
sweetness and lightness, remain always the chief 
consideiati(m. If milk is used, it should be scald- 
ed and cooled as this i)revents its souring. Ne.xt 
comes the mixing or vsponging of the bread. 
1'his is not a mere mixture, but an actual chemic- 
al combination, and as we cannot use v\'ater alone 
to eifect tliis, it must be supplemented by knead- 
ing, and thus comes our most im]:)ortant part. 

The excellence of bread dejjends much u])on its 
kneading, .First work the duugh in the pan un- 
til it h)ses part of its stickine-s, then Hour the 



II KKF.AD 

board thickly, flour the hands, take out the dou<j^h 
and knead rapidly and continuously by drawing 
the dough farthest from you over to the center, 
and pressing it down with the ball of the hand. 
Repeat this several times turning- the dough 
around until every part is thoroughlv and evenly 
kneaded. When you first begin the dough will be 
soft and sticky, but when you can knead it on an 
unfloured dry board, kneading may be discon- 
tinued. After this you set it away to rise. Give 
it time to fully expand, but be careful that the 
dough does not fall as it is then sour and cannot 
be restored to the original sweetness. 

Next comes the moulding. After the dough is 
very light, divide it carefully into loaves, knead 
lightly on the board until formed, place in well 
greased pans and set in a warm place to rise un- 
til double its bulk. 

Now comes the baking. Great care should be 
taken to have the oven just right. If you can 
hold your hand in the oven while counting twenty 
slowly, it is all right. The bread should be in 
the oven ten minutes before it begins to brown. 
Brush the tops of the loaves with butter before 
putting in to bake. This keeps the crust moist. 

POTATO YEAST NO. 1. 

Peel three or four medium sized potatoes. 
Grate them and add one tablespoonful of salt and 
one tablespoonful of sugar. Pour enough boiling 
water over the potatoes to thoroughly cook all 
the starch; when milk warm add either one dis- 
solved yeast cake or one cup of veast left over 
from the last time. 

Helen L. Waterman.

POTATO YEAST NO. 2. 

Borrow one cup of yeast from vour neijjchbor. 
At nio^ht peel three larj^e potatoes and cook in 
one quart of water until tender. Mash them and 
add one tablespoonful of salt and two tablespoon - 
fuls of sugar. Pour the water in which they were 
cooked over them and let cool. Add the cup of 
yeast, cover, and let stand until morning". Keej^ 
out enouo-h to start with and set your bread with 
the rest. 

Mrs. Charles Nelson. 
HOT WEATHER YEAST 

2 jj^ood sized potatoes 

3 tablepoonfuls of su^^ar

1 yeast cake 
Grate the potatoes then add suyfar and salt and 
mix well. Add one pint of warm (not hot) water. 
Add yeast cake dissolved in a little water. Stir 
well and vSet to rise.^ One cup of yeast will make

knead until perfectly smooth and free from sticki- 
ness. Place in greased bowl and set in a warm 
place to rise. Keep the bread warm and let rise

Emma Barnktt. 
WHOLE WHEAT BREAD 

One cake compressed yeast and two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar creamed together. Add two 
cups warm water and stir. Then add two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt. Add w^hole wheat tlour until 
stiff enough to beat, but not stiff enough to 
knead. Add one tablevspoonful of shortening and 
beat about ten minutes, then grease the top, 
cover and set in warm place to rise. 

Emma Barnrtt. 
GOOD LIGHT BREAD 

Take one quart of wdieat bran, put it into 
warm water with a teaspooniui of salt and set 
in a warm place to rise. When light, strain 
through a cloth' to keej) out all the Oian. Put 
into a vessel with flour enough to make a sponge, 
add a small pinch of soda, one teas{)oonful f)f salt 
and one tablespoonful of sugar, let rise, then add 
flour to make dough. Knead well. When light 
mould into loaves, let rise and bake in a moder- 
eratelv hot oven.

GRAHAM YEAST BRKAD 

Mix at nio-ht two cups of water with one-half 
cake compressed yeast and enough white flour to 
make a thin batter, beating- five minutes with a 
vSpoon. Next morning add one small cup molavss- 
es, one teaspoonful soda, twoteaspoonfuls of salt 
and enough Graham flour to make a thin batter. 
Put in baking pans to rise. 

P. J. ALvSTP, Presno. 



Otb<ir Breads. 



RAISIN BRKAD 

Take a pound package of seeded raisins, pour 
boiling water over them and stir vigorously and 
dump into a colander. Pick out all stems and poor 
raisins and grind through a meat grinder. Have 
ycmr bread for four loaves sponged (us;ng any 
formula you choose) and ready to mould. Drop in 
your raisins and thoroughly incorporate with the 
dough, adding flour and kneading until elastic. 
Leave in the pan until light, then divide into loaves 
and let stand until light and bake. When you re- 
move from the oven, grease the crust with olive 
oil (Gower's). This bread is fine eaten with 
olive oil. Mrs. Amos Harris. 

SALT RISING BRKAD 

]4 pint new milk, corn nie:l to thicken. 
1 tablesi)oonl'ul sugar, 



15 15KEAD 

1 teasp(K)nful salt 

Pinch of soda. Flour 
Set the milk on the fire and heat to boilings. 
Remove and stir in corn meiil until as thick 
as thin mush. Keep .it in a warm place all 
nio'ht. In the morning" it will be lig-lit. Put the 
flour in a bowl (if cold, heat or slightly warm 
the hour) pour in the mush and mix \vith warm 
sweet milk and water, equal parts. Add the 
sugar, salt and soda. Mix a stiff batter, cover 
and keep warm. In an hour or two it will be 
lig-ht. Work in flour to make a stiff dough. Let 
it rivSe. Mould in loaves, put in greased ]jans, let 
rise and bake. 

MRvS. MaR(xARET TROWBRITKiK. 

SALT RISING LIGHT BRKAD 

Take one-half pint nevv-^ sweet milk. At night 
put on the lire and let come to scalding heat. 
Stir in corn meal to make a stiff batter. Set in 
a warm place over ni^^ht. Next morning put one- 
half pint warm water into the meal batter then 
stir in encnigh flour to make a moderatelv thick 
batter to which add one teaspoonful of sug"ar, set 
in a kettle of warm water, keep the water warm 
and in two hours your veast will be ready to 
make into bread. Sift one gallon of flour, a scant 
teaspoonful of salt, pour in vour veast, put in 
warm water to rinse all the veast out of vessel 
and pour it in with the veast. Work vour dough 
well, put in a Inicket, (I use a one-gallon tin 
bucket to raise bread in as it rises much better 
in a small deep vessel than where it is allowed to 
spread out so much) vset bucket back in water and 
keep covered. In one hour it will be ready to 



mould into loaves. Put on hoard, work well. 
Have your pans «j;-reased well with lard or butter, 
cut your loaves, roll them in butter which will 
keep them from ^ettin^ hard while risin<J-, set in 
a warm place and in half an hour it will bereadv 
to bake. Have your oven hot when puttin(>- in 
but let it cool down so the bread will not burn 
and let bake one hour with moderate heat. This 
will make three loaves. Mrs. N. J. Sloan. 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD 

Scald one quart of whole w^heat flour with one 
(juart of boilin«>- water, pourin^fthe water on verv 
gradually that no lumps be formed. When this 
has cooled to luke warm, add one-half cup home 
made yeast or one-half cake compressed veast 
dissolved in a little luke warm water and leave to 
rise, carefully covered and kept in a warm room. 
When the ferment is li^ht which will be shown 
by its beintJ- a mass of white substance like sea- 
foam, rather than by haviny^ jjfreatly risen; add 
sufticient warm sifted flour to make a verv thick 
batter and having beaten it well, leave it to rise 
a^ain. When well risen and cracked over the 
to]) like "crazed" china, sufficient flour to make 
it of the proper consistency must be added and 
the dou,i^h thonrnj^rhj y kneaded. When the douj^-h 
clin«-s too-ether and works away from l^he sides of 
the bowl, encmo-h flour has been added. Bread 
should always be kneaded as soft as it can be 
handled and only sufficient tl(mr added to keep it 
from stickintr to the board. Mtmld into loaves, 
I>lace in l)read ]>ans and put in a warm place to 
rise. When risen to nearly double their size, put 
in the oven and let bake from one to one and one- 
hallhours. When done, remove from the pan

Soup. 



Mrs. J. P. Duff. 



"The fiiiio'i is a homely plant, 
As rank as most thut grr.ws, 
And yet it t)eats, to mix with soup, 
The lilv or the rose." 



While the meiking' of a soup is a simple erou^h 
process and seemint^ly requires little of either art 
or experience, the soups we often meet in public 
places teach us that not all soups are either de- 
sirable or palatable and to make a |)alatable, nu- 
tritious and healthful soup with the proper com- 
ming'ling" of flavors, requires some experience and 
no little study. 

The best base is always lean uncooked meat — 
fresh is the best — a pound of meat to a quart of 
water, is a good rule. For white soups veal or 
fowl must be used. 

STOCK 

Take four pounds of lean meat, the inferior 
parts are just as good, or a cracked shin bone. 
After washing, place in a kettle with four quarts 
of cold w^ater. Let it cook slowly at flrst and 
skim carefully just before it boils. Add salt and 
simmer gently for five or six hours closelv cover- 
ed, then set away to cool. The next da}' remove 
the fat which has hardened on top (save it for 
drippings) and after straining you will have a 
good rich stock from which a g^reat variety of 
different kinds of soup may be made according to 



SOUP 32 

the different flavors and seasonin^^s you may 
choose to use. If soup is required daily, a soup 
stock kettle is an indispensable article and indeed 
every thrifty and economical house-wife will have 
her soup kettle at hand, for into this kettle may 
be put the remains of yesterday's roast, the trim- 
minyrs and undesirable ends of the beef steaks and 
the bones. We do not advise using pieces ol pork 
or mutton, beef alone is better — of course addinj^ 
water a^^ain as new material goes in. Quite often 
too, it will'be necessary to empty the kettle, wash 
clean and begin again. 

A plain, simple soup may have only pepper and 
salt for seasoning, while a very rich soup may 
have a dozen different savors so delicately blend- 
ed that no one is noticea*l)le and herein lies the 
art. Thvme, summersavory, mint, sweet marjo- 
ram, parsley, celery, cloves and tarragon are a 
few of the delectable savors much sought after 
by the experienced cook. Rice, sago, vermicelli 
and macaroni are all valuable in making the desir- 
ed varietv of soups. When either of the is used, 
it is advisable to partially cook it before putting 
into the soup as the stock you use is already 
cooked and requires only to be heated and then 
added in proper quantities to the other ingre 
ents.

"Mmsut, I iniirvel lidw tlie fishes live in the sea." 
"W h\ lis men do aland, the Kieat ones eat u]) the little ones." 

Peric-les. 



Kxceptini^" salmon, fish is much more easily di- 
gested than meats but not so nutritious. Fish to 
be good, must be fresh, the fresher the better. A 
fresh fish will have bright eyes and shinv vscales 
and when in season will boil white and curdy; but 
when out of season, the muscles will look trans- 
parent and bluish although thoroughly cooked. 

Do not use too much water when cleaning tish, 
only what water is really necessary, then drain, 
wipe drv and place on ice until ready to cook. 
Sprinkle fresh-water fish with salt and let stand 
several hours or over night, then rinse, drv thor- 
oughly and cook. Never soak fresh-water fish 
except wdien thev are frozen; then place them in 
ice water to thaw and cook immediately. Salt 
fish may be soaked over night in cold water. Al- 
wa3\s place it skin side up so that the salt may go 
down to the bottom of the ])an. 

In boiling fish, allow from five to ten minutes 
to the pound after putting into the boiling water. 
To test, pae^s a knife along the bone and if done, 
the fiv^h will separate easilv. When boiling fish, 
always add a little salt and vinegar to the water 
and fish will be more nutritious. Plunge fish in- 
to boil in p- water, then set where It will simmer 



FISH 42 

g-ently until done. Put salmon into tc-])id water 
to retain its color. 

Fish should always be well done and should be 
served very hot. Serve fresh tish with squash 
and trreen peas; salt fish with beets and carrots; 
salt pork, potatoes and parsnips with either. 
Garnishes for fish are parsley, sliced beets, fried 
smelts and lobster coral.

When selecting- f()\vls for c<)()kin<4", always if 
possible, secure vountr ones. Select a young' hen 
turkey of about ten pounds. Never cook chicken 
over two years old. Turkeys are greatly improv- 
ed by steaming' an hour before roasting; a little 
vinegar added to the fowl when boiling makes it 
more tender. When dressing turkey or chicken, 
wash thoroughly, wipe them dry, then rub well 
with salt, putting some on the inside also. The 
garnishes for chicken or turkey are slices of 
orange or lemon, aj)])le sauce, parsley, thin slices ol

'■'Tis not the food, but the content, 
That makes tlie table's ineiriment. 
Where trouble serves the board, we eat

A little pipkin, with a bit 
Of mutton, or of veal in it,

More than a feast contenteth me." 

Herrick. 



To be a g^ood meat cook, one should know the 
parts of the animals sold in the markets and their 
economical uses. The piece to select for a prime 
roast is the first five ribs. The middle ribs are 
«j"ood for roasts and the next or chuck ribs are 
second choice. Very good steak may be cut from 
these ribs also. The shoulder is considered best 
for pot roasts, stews, soups, hash, and mince-meat; 
the brisket for soups or corned beef; neck for saus- 
ages, mince pie meat and soup. Rump makes good 
corned beef, stews and steaks. The round for 
steaks, pot roasts, boiling and stewing; shin for 
hashes and soups; thick flank for stews, corned 
and pressed beef, also a nice boiling piece; thin 
flank for corned beef and boiling. 

In pork, the leg makes roasts and smoked ham; 
sirloin, fine chops and roasts; foreloin, second 
choice roasts and chops; neck, inferior roasts and 
boiling pieces; the shoulder is used mostly for 
pickling and smoking and is also very fine for 
boiling, whether fresh or corned. The head is 
used for head cheese, puddings and the like. Jowl 
is nice for smoking; the feet are used for souse 
and for pickling. 



POULTRY AND GAME 72 

The loin of mutton, the best end, is used for 
fillinjj- and roasts and makes fine chops. The rest 
of the loin, second choice, is used for chops 
and roasts; the rump end for boiling and roast- 
inj^; shoulder for boilinj^-, filling- and roasting; leg 
mostly used for chops, roasting and boiling; breast 
and .flank used for stews, meat pies and cheap 
roasts; neck for stews. 

Good beef is a bright red with plenty of fat. 
()ld beef is a dark red and coarse grain. If the 
rind of pork is rough and thick and cannot easily 
be impressed with the finger, it is old. Measly 
pork is almost poisonous and may be easily de- 
tected, the fat being full of small kernels. " The 
flesh of fresh pork will look cool and smooth; 
when moist or clammy, it is stale. Good mutton 
is a bright red color and a firm grain. The fat is 
white and clear. 

The more gently meat boils, the more tender 
it will become. Allow twenty minutes for the 
boiling of each pound of meat. In boiling fresh 
meat, to make it rich and nutritious, it should be 
placed in a kettle of boiling water and skimmed 
well as soon as it begins to boil. The meat should 
be turned occasionally and kept well under the 
water and fresh hot water supplied, as it evapor- 
ates very rapidly in boiling. No salt should be 
added until the meat is nearly done, as it extracts 
the juices in boiling. Salt meat should be put on in 
cold water so that it may freshen in cooking. Al- 
low twenty minutes to the pound for fresh, and 
thirty-five for salt m.eats, the time to be modified, 
of course, by the (|uality of the meat. A pod of 
red pei)pers in the water will prev<.mt anv un- 
pleasant Oder from filling the house. Roast meats 
re()uir(' a brisk fire. Baste often. Twenty min- 
utes is rc'(juired for roasting each pound of frt-sh

meat. Broiled meatvS, to retain their juices, should 
be broiled over red hot coals, entirely free from 
smoke, and the coals sufficiently low enoug^h in the 
grate so as not to sear the meat when first plac- 
ed over the heat. Turn steaks and chops fre- 
(juently, that every part may be evenly done. Do 
not stick the fork in the lean part, always in the 
fat or outer skin. The best pieces for broiling- 
are the porter-house, sirloin and rump. 

Plow TO MAKJi: A ROUND vSTKAK 
TENDER 

Any piece from the round mav be prepared so 
as to be as tender as the most delicate sirloin if 
care be taken with it. Spread vour steak with 
(xower's olive oil instead of beating it to bruivse 
the fibres, which lets the juice run out into the 
fire. Let it remain an hour or so in the oil before 
cooking. Broil (juicklv so that each side will be 
thoroughly charred, then prop up your broiler so 
as to be a little further from the fire for the slov\ - 
er heating through that cooks the inside juices 
without losing them. Melt a bit of l)utter in two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar and pour it over the 
steak while hot. This finishes the tendering ])ro- 
cess and makes appeti;cing gravy. You can sub- 
stitute lemon juice for the vinegar; all that is 
needed is an acid that will make the fibre tender. 
Additions can also be made to the vinegar of a 
little chopped onion and the yolks of one or two 
eggs with a very little cayenne, if vou wish to 
have a rich gravy. 

There are two methods of frving, one with a 
very little fat. The pan and the fat must be hot 
before the meat to be fried is put into it. If the 
pan is hot and just enough fat to keej) the meat 



MEATS 74 

from stickino- to it, the heat bcinj? inaiiitained 80 
that it will cook quickly, it will be nearly as nice 
as if broiled. The other method of frying con- 
sists of entirely immersing- the article to be cook- 
ed in sufficient smoking hot fat to cover it, and 
keepino- the fat at that de.i^^ree of heat until the 
food is brown. It should then be taken out with 
a skimmer and laid on brown paper for a moment 
to free it from ^rrease. 

BKKF ROAST 

Place the top round of beef in pan of very hot 
fat and put in a hot oven to sear quickly. Turn 
when the lower side is seared and let the top side 
rest in the fat and sear. Then place the ^rate 
underneath the meat so that the meat will not 
come in contact with the fat. Baste about every 
ten minutes. After it is seared, sift a little flour 
ov^er the meat. Cook about fifteen minutes to the 
pound. Have verv hot oven for the first one- 
quarter of an hour, then moderate oven.

Ground mace, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, 

ginger and salt. 
Take out the bcmes and rub meat well all over 
with sugar. Next day rub in the spices which 
should be well mixed. Then rub in sufficient salt 
to make a brine. Rub with salt and turn each day 
for ten davs or two weeks according to the size 
of the meat. Take out of brine, roll and bind 
tightly. Cut into cold water and boil not less than 
four hours. Place in a dish with weights to press 
it. Donotremove the binding until cold. A tongue 
prepared in the same wav is very good.

BACON, RIGHTLY BROILKD 

The only way to cook bacon — both for the 
matter of appearance and for digestive qualities — 
is to broil it, not over a bed of coals, but in a very 
hot ov^en. Cut the bacon in thin slices, rejecting 
the rind. Lay the pieces on a fine wire broiler. 
Place it over a dripping pan and set it in a hot 
oven. It requires to be turned just once. Drain 
the bacon on brown paper. If vou wish to serve 
calf's liver with this, sprinkle the liver with pep- 
per and salt, roll it in flour and fry brown in the 
bacon drippings. Serve with a curled morsel of 
bacon on top of each piece of liver.

BRAINS 

Take two or more cplves' brains; lay in salted 
water for two or three hours, then remove the 
outer skin and boil in salted water for ten min- 
utes. Take out and divide into sizable pieces for 
serving, roll in egg and then in cracker crumbs 
and fry a nice brown, turning them in the pan 
when one side is done until both sides are a nice 
brown. Don't have the pieces too large and be 
sure each one is thoroughly done. Serve with 
slices of lemon, or if preferred, you may lay each 
piece of the brains (without njlling in egg and 
cracker crumbs) on a large slice of bacon. Put in 
baking pan and bake one-half hour or until brown. 
I prefer the first method.

Mrs. a. E. Wagstaff. 

"Now good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both." 

Shakespeare, 

Vegetables do not contain the food values that 
cereals, nuts and fruits do, yet they form a very 
important element in the dietary of those who 
still adhere to the practise of meat eating, and a 
cook should not only be familiar with their nu- 
tritive values, but should also have a correct idea 
of the chemical effect of heat and water and salt 
upon the vegetables she uses for dinner. Here are 
a few things for her to remember: the most nu- 
tritious part of potatoes, carrots, pansnips and 
similiar tubers, lies near to the surface, so care 
should be taken to scrape or pare as thinly as 
possible. Steam or bake vegetables whenever 
practicable, as their finer flavors are thus more 
easily retained and they suffer less diminution in 
food value. In boiling, use no more water than is 
needful ,to cook them, as the water drained off 
carries with it desirable food properties. Be care- 
ful not to burn, as the least scorch ruins the deli- 
cate flavor of any vegetable. If necessarv to add 
more water have it boiling hot. 

In referring to the time-table at the end of this 
department, use judgment and count from the 
moment the pot actually begins to boil. Young 
vegetables require less time in cooking than those 
more fully matured. N. P. H. 

ARTICHOKES 

Pare and cut artichokes into slices about one- 



VEGETABLES 92 

eig-hth of an inch thick. Fry in sufficient boiling 
lard or olive oil (Gower's) to swim them. When 
a rich brown, sprinkle them with salt and serve 
hot. 

ASPARAGUS 

Choose fresh asparagus. Scrape off white skin 
from lower end. Lay in cold water until crisp. 
Put in boiling water which has been salted. When 
done, lay on slices of toast and serve with melt- 
ed butter. 

ASPARAGUS WITH CRKAM 

Wash asparagus, tie in bundles and plunge in- 
to boiling water salted, a teaspoonful for every 
quart of water. Boil rapidly for fifteen minutes. 
Take up, cut off the tender heads and put in a 
vessel with a cupful of milk or cream to every 
. quart of asparagus. Simmer ten minutes. Mix one 
tablespoonful of flour and butter together and 
stir into the milk. Add salt and pepper to taste 
and simmer five minutes longer. 

K. Marden. 

BEANS, SPANISH 

Boil one pint of dried beans in the regular way. 
When nearly done, let the water boil down and 
add one can of tomatoes. Let boil one hour and add 
a dash of cayenne pepper and one-half cupful of 
grated cheese. Mrs. D. S. Hallock. 

LIMA bf:ans 

Shell, wash and put into boiling water with a 



93 VEGETABLES 

little salt. When boiled tender, drain, season and 
dress with cream or large lumps of butter and let 
simmer for a few moments. 

BEANS AND OLIVK OIL 

Pick over and carefully wash two cupfuls of 
beans. Add six cupfuls of water and set on the 
back of the stove t& parboil. Have at hand an 
earthen bean crock. Into this slice a small onion, 
drop in a pepper-pod with the seeds removed, a 
dessert spoonful of salt and three tablespoonfuls 
of olive oil (Gower's), also a sprinkle each of mus- 
tard and thyme. When the beans are swelled out 
and tender, but not soft, pour them into the crock 
adding" two cupfuls more of water. Cover, set in 
the oven and bake twelve hours, or until a delicate 
brown. Mrs. Amos Harris. 

STRING BEANS 

Choose fine young beans. Remove strings and 
ends. Break in two and throw into a sauce pan 
of boiling water, well salted. When tender, 
drain in a colander and put in a small piece of 
butter and dash of pepper. 

GENUINE MEXICAN BEANS AS 
PREPARED IN MEXICO 

Use pink beans which may be procured at all 
grocery stores. To two cupfuls of beans add six 
cupfuls of water and soak over night. If in a hurry 
one may boil beans without previous soaking, but 
the soaking reduces the time of cooking by one 
hour. Add a small onion and boil gently until 
beans will mash between fini^ers. Do not throw 



VEGETABLES 94 

away liquid in which beans are boiled. Into a deep 
frying pan place a large cooking spoonful of 
fresh lard. Allow to become very hot. With 
perforated spoon, lay beans gently into pan. To 
avoid setting setting fire to lard, move to back of 
stove. After laying in as many as will absorb 
lard place pan again over hot fire and mix beans 
and lard thoroughly until beans appear to have a 
coating of lard and begin to burst. Add a cupful 
of the liquid in which beans were boiled and 
gently crush beans with cooking spoon, but do not 
mash. Add the remainder of liquid and allow to 
simmer on back of stove for one-half hour or until 
beans are of consistency desired, either with con- 
siderable liquid but thick, or quite dry. Success 
depends upon observing the following rules: do 
not add salt until beans are boiled soft. The onion 
is not perceptible after cooking, only giving the 
beans the characteristic Mexican flavor which no 
spice can produce. Have lard boiling. Do not 
boil beans in tin. Prepared spices or Mexican 
chili may be added after last portion of liquid is 
used. Repeated warmings improve taste. If very 
dry, add a little water and place in oven a few 
minutes. 

BRUSSKLS SPROUTS 

Pick, trim and wash a number of sprouts. Put 
into boiling water. Add a teaspoonful of salt.

avside until cold. Chop fine, add two beaten eggs, 
tablespoonful butter, three of cream, salt and 
pepper to taste. Stir well and bake in buttered 
dish until brown. 

CARROTS 

To prepare them, — If they are plunged into 
boiling water for five minutes, the skin can be 
rubbed off much more easily than by the scraping 
process. After cutting into thin slices, put into 
a sauce pan with three tablespoonfuls of butter 
and three of water, a little salt and pepper. 
Cover the dish and stev^^ for thirty minutes. 
Meanwhile, beat light, the yolks of two eggs, 
and one-half cupful of cream. When carrots are 
cooked tender, pour this mixture over them in 
sauce pan and let it remain long enough for eggs 
to cook. 

CARROTS, PRKNCH METHOD

some butter in hot spider. When butter bubbles, 
lay in carrots. Sprinkle with sugar, salt, pepper 
and chopped parsley. Fry until crisp and brown.

water to make the cooked sauce sufficientl}- juicy. 
Peel and cut them in inch-long pieces, put them 
in the upper part of a double boiler with a little 
sugar and steam until they are tender. The juice 
will be a rich, delicate syrup, tinged with a deep 
pink color.

Salads. 

Mrs. G. S. Waterman. 



"Cheerf\il looks make every dish a feast, 
And 'tis tliat crowns a welcome." 



In making salads, it is necessary to have all the 
ingredients cold and all the vegetables fresh and 
crisp. If for any reason lettuce and celery and 
cabbage are not perfectly fresh, they can be made 
to seem so by putting them in water and setting 
them in a cold place for several hours. A little 
lemon juice added to the water in which celery is 
standing will help to blanch it — and it must be 
remembered that the appearance of the salad is 
fully as important as the taste. Almost an3^thing 
that is fresh and crisp and pretty may be used to 
garnish a salad, radishes cut in thin slices or fancy 
shapes, beets cut in dice, lettuce hearts, hard- 
boiled eggs, parsley, slices of tomato, olives, aspic 
or tomato jelly cut in cubes, nasturtium leaves 
and flowers.

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Put the yolks of one or more raw eggs into a 
bowl; add a pinch of salt, pepper and dry mus- 
tard; then take a Dover egg beater and beat until 
thick, add two or three drops of Gower's olive 
oil, beat again, then a few drops of oil, beat 
again continuing thus until so thick as to clog 
the beater, then thin with a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice or vinegar, beat well; then add olive oil 
again, then lemon juice, continuing thus until you 
have used a pint of oil or as much as desired. 
When through beating it should be thick like 
whipped cream, and after being thoroughly chill- 
ed on the ice will be stiff like jelly. Will keep 
finely. In making this dressing the eggs, oil, vine- 
gar and bowl should be as cold as possible, and it 
should be made in a cold room. It takes but fif- 
teen minutes to make a pint. The old wav of 
making it with a fork would take from two to 
four hours for this amount.

€ggs. 



Mrs. Z. L. Ward. 



Kggs are regarded by some as a g^reat delicac}- 
by others as a prime article of food, but in either 
case, the mode of cooking- has much to do with the 
healthfulness and satisfaction of eating. The 
yolk is considered much more nutritious than the 
white. The quality of eggs vary considerably 
according to the food upon which the fowls are 
fed. Certain foods communicate distinct flavors. 
Powls that get plenty of grain produce the best 
and heaviest eggs; the yolks are darker and the 
whole egg is stronger than those produced from 
grass and fruit. It is said that dark shelled eggs 
are much richer in flavor and have larger yolks 
than white shelled eggs. 

There are several ways to test eggs. A good 
way is to drop them into a bucket of water. A 
fresh egg will go quickly to the bottom and rest 
on its side. An older one will stand on the little 
end and as they get older and lighter, will rest 
farther and farther from the bottom. A bad egg 
always floats. This is an infallible rule to distin- 
guish a good egg from a bad one. E^ggs should 
be kept in a cool, dry place and handled with care 
as rough treatment may cause the yolks to mingle 
with the whites bv rupturing the membrane which 
separates them; then the egg spoils quickly. 

TO PREvSKRVK EGGS NO. 1 

Fill a five-gallon keg with fresh eggs; pour 



EGGS 124 

over them strong- lime water in which has been 
dissolved a teacupful of salt; put a light w^eig-ht 
on top, al\va3^s takingcare that the eg-gs are com- 
pletely covered; as the water evaporates, add 
more. No proportions are neceSvSary in prepar- 
ing the liquid as only a certain amount of lime can 
be absorbed by water. The thicker the mixture, 
the more inconvenient it is to remove the eggs. 
All eggs that crack will be unfit for use. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS, NO. 2 

Take a colander full of fresh laid eggs and pour 
a teakettleful of boiling water over them. The 
heat of the water cooks the white of the e^g 
sufficiently to keep out the air. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS, NO. 3 

Dip each Qgg in gum arable water, melted 
grease, or a vsolution of water and plaster paris. 
In either case, a coating is formed on the shell, 
making it air tight. Take good fresh eggs and 
wrap each one in vsoft paper (soft newspaper will 
do) the same as lemons and pack them in a box 
with the small end down always, never allowing 
the shell of one egg to touch the shell of another. 
Put in a dark cool place and you will be surpris- 
ed to see how long they keep good. 

HOW TO ECONOMIZE WITH EGGS 

Left over yolks of eggs put at once into a glass 
of cold water will keep fresh and soft for several 
days, while if put into a dry cup and covered, the 
volks would be unlit for use the second day. Drop 



125 EGGS 

them in a tin of hot water and cook, then they 
can be used in salads, as a garnish, or in soups. 
Left over whites can be used for meringues, or 
made into macaroons or kisses, (see candies). 
Where hard boiled yolks are wanted, it is much 
better to carefully separate the yolks from the 
whites and drop the yolks into water that is boil- 
ing hot; cook vslowl y twent}^ minutes. In this way 
the yvhites are saved for another purpose. Left 
over soft boiled eggs may be boiled again and 
laid aside to be used cold in a salad, sauce, or as 
a garnish or sandwich. To boil a slightly crack- 
ed eg^ without having the contents burst out of 
the crack, carefulh^ pierce the shell at the big 
end. The unwhipped white of eggs makes a good 
paste for pasteing paper over the top of jelly 
tumblers. To beat the whites of eggs stiff, means 
to have them stiff enough to remain in the bowl 
or dish if it were turned upside down. To beat 
eggs lightly, stop beating before they foam. Ten 
common eggs weigh a pound. 

BOILK.D WKrS 

Give a fresh laid otg^ one-half minute longer to 
boil. Place the eggs in a pan or small kettle and 
pour boiling water over them to cover well and 
set on the back of the stove where they will keep 
hot but not boil for five minutes. Three minutes 
cooks the whites about right for soft boiled eggs. 

MRvS. J. A. TURNKR. 

BAKED PX;GS 

Take a hc^t platter. Break on it as manv eggs 
as you need for your meal. Sprinkle with salt, 
pepper and lumps of butter. Set in the oven and 



EGGS I2fi 

in about live minutes the whites will be set and 
eg-gs sufficiently cooked. This is a handy way on 
wash or ironing- da\' when the stove is all in use. 
Another way is to butter vSome g^em irons and 
break an egg in each one. Pepper and salt. Put 
a small lump of butter on each one and set in the 
oven. Will cook in a very short time. The irons 
should be hot when the eg-gs are broken into them. 

BAKKD EGGS IN TOMATO CUPS 

Choose larg;e round tomatoes; cut off the tops 
(do not skin them), scoop out the pulp, dust with 
salt and pepper; put small lump of butter in each 
one; place them in a pan and bake for ten min- 
utes. An odd but toothsome luncheon. If you 
wish, sprinkle them lightly with cracker crumbs 
before putting- them in the oven. 

Mrs. Z. L. Ward. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

Put a tablespoonful of butter into a frying pan. 
When hot, put in the desired number of ej^^g-s 
beaten lightly. Pepper and salt them and add 
half a cupful of milk or cream to a dozen eggs. 
Stir constantly and as socm as they begin to set, 
take them off and jxmr out. They must not be 
hard. 

POACHED ECxGS 

Place some muffin rings in boiling water. Break 
an e^^ in each ring and it will take the form of 
the ring and be much more pleasing in a])pear- 
ance than the ordinary way. When ])oaching 
eggs for children, use beef broth or milk occa-

sionally. They will appreciate the change. Sea- 
son with salt only. When poaching eggs in water 
always use a teaspoonful of vinegar or lemon 
juice to one pint of water to set the whites of 
eggs. 

FRIED KGGS 

Put a teaspoonful of butter and one-half tea- 
spoonful of lard in the frying pan and let it get 
hot; then break in the eggs and fry quickly. 
When about done enough to suit the taste, baste 
them over the top with a spoonful or two of hot 
grease, or turn them over and take up quick. 
Kggs to be good, must be fried quickly and not 
in too much fat and taken up the moment they 
are done. To cook eggs in gem irons, put the 
irons on top of the stove to get hot; put in a small 
piece of butter and cook either on top of stove or 
in the oven. 

FRIED EGGS WITH HAM 

Fry the ham in its own fat, 'then fry the eggs 
afterward in the same. Dish up on the same 
platter. 

EGGS WITH BROILED HAM 
OR BEEF STEAK 

Broil thin slices of ham or steak. When done, 
put a bit of butter on each slice (if beef, jx-pper 
and salt). Poach the eggs in hot water and lay 
one neatly on each slice. 

POACHED EGGS IN TOMATOES 

Boil one pint stewed tomatoes; slip in gently 



EGGS 128 

one-half dozen e^^gs. Keep the tomatoes just be- 
low the boiling point until the eggs are done. 
Serve on toast, or if preferred, break both yolks 
and whites with a fork when half done. Season 
with pepper, butter and salt. 

BUTTERKD EGGS OR KGG TOAST 

Beat well together the whites and 3'olks of four 
fresh laid eggs. Put one and a half tablespoonfuls 
butter in a basin and stand it in hot water, stir- 
ing it all the time until it is melted. Pour the 
butter and eggs into a lined sauce-pan, hold it 
over a gentle fire and as the mixture begins to 
warm, pour it two or three times into the basin 
and back again that the two ingredients may be 
well mixed. Keep stirring the eggs and butter one 
way in the sauce-pan until they are hot without 
boiling. Send to the table on a warm flat dish 
with some slices of hard boiled eggs on the top, 
or spread very thick on buttered toast. In either 
way they must be served very hot. 

CURRIFvD KGGS 

6 eggs,

little off the ends to make them stand. Put the 
butter in a frying pan to melt, then add the flour. 
Mix until smooth, add the milk and stir contin- 
ually until it boils, add salt and pepper. Stand 
the eggs on a heated platter, pour the sauce over 
and around them; serve hot. 

EGGS IN CREAM 

Put a half cupful or more of cream into a shal- 
low earthen dish and place in a pan of boiling 
water. When the cream is hot, break in as many 
eggs as the bottom of the dish will hold. Cook 
until well set, basting them over the top with the 
hot cream— or put a spoonful or two of cream 
into individual or vegetable dishes, break an i^^^ 
in each and cook in the oven, or in a steamer over 
bailing water. JosKPHINK MiTCHKL. 

creamp:d e(;gs no. 3 

Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Make one pint

of cream sauce. Have six slices of toast on a hot 
dish. Put a layer of sauce on each one, then a 
part of the whites of the egg's, cut in thin strips, 
then a layer of yolks rubbed through a sieve. Re- 
peat and finish w^ith a third layer of sauce. Place 
in the oven about three minutes. Garnish w^ith 
parsley and serve. K. Marden. 

EGGS WITH CRKAMKD BKEF 
OR COD FISH 

Just before dishing the beef or fish, poach as 
many eggs as there are persons to be served and 
place in the dish, pour the hot creamed meat over 
them and serve. Another way is to drop the eggs 
into the pan with the meat and let them cook un- 
til done. Care must be used not to break the eggs 
in transferring from the pan to the dish. 

EGGS WITH CRKAMKD POTATOES 

Peel some small potatoes or three or four good 
sized ones; cut them in pieces about one and one- 
half inches thick; cook in stew kettle with three 
pints of hot water; when nearly done, add salt, 
pepper, tablespoonful of butter, teaspoonful of 
flour and a cupful of heated milk or cream. Break 
four or five eggs in the liquid on top of the pota- 
toes and poach until sufiiciently cooked. Lift the 
eggs out with a tablespoon on a warm plate and 
put on some butter, pepper and salt; take up the 
potatoes and serve an egg with each spoonful of 
potatoes or slip the eggs on top of the potato 
dish and serve. Mrs. Z. L Ward. 

EGGS WITH FRIED POTATOES 

Fry the potatoes nicely and break over the top 



EGGS 132 

two or three eggs and stir into the potatoes 
while hot enough to cook the eggs. Abetter way 
is to break the eggs into a cup, pour in a spoonful 
of hot water and give them a whip or two with a 
fork, just enough to break them; the water keeps 
them from being string}^ 

EGGS WITH ONIONS 

Cut an onion in small pieces like dice, fry it 
lightly in a tablespoonful of butter then dash in 
a teaspoonful of vinegar. Butter a shallow^ dish, 
sprinkle the onions over it and break in five eggs. 
Be careful not to break the yolks. Bake in a hot 
oven until the whites become a delicate film. Dust 
with salt and pepper and sprinkle all over with 
bread crumbs fried delicately brown in butter. 
Garnish with water cress or parsley. 

KG(; CHOWDER 

Frv some pork; peel and slice vsome onions in the 
hot fat; slice some potatoes on top and let cook; 
season with pepper and salt. Stir to keep from 
burning and just before taking off break in as 
many eggs as there are persons to serve and let 
boil up sufficiently to cook them through; season 
with ]3epper and salt. If there is not enough fat, 
use some butter. Be careful not to put in too 
man V potatoes. One large onion and two common 
sized potatoes is about right. 

Mrs. Z. L. Ward. 

EGG BALLS 

Yolks of four hard boiled eggs mashed fine 
with the yolk of one raw^ ^^J^i '^ teaspoonful of 



133 EGGS 

flour, salt and pepper to taste and a sprinkle of 
parsley. Make into balls half the size of a thimble 
and boil in clear water slightly salted for two 
minutes. To be added to soup when ready to 
serve. 

DKVILKD EGGS, NO. 1 

Put the required number of eggs into a kettle, 
pour cold water over them and allow it to come 
to a boil and boil steadily for ten minutes. Re- 
move the shells and cut the eggs in half the round 
way. Take out the yolks and clip off each round- 
ed end so the}'- will stand like little cups. Then 
mash the yolk, add salt and vinegar sufficient to 
make a very smooth stiff paste. If desired, chow- 
chow or finely minced ham, either is good, may 
be added. After the whites have been refilled with 
the mixture, sprinkle a little black pepper over 
the top of each one. These are nice served with 
salad. Emma Barnett. 

DEVILED EGGS, NO. 2 

Boil a dozen eggs full twenty minutes; drop in 
cold water and remove the shell. With a sharp 
knife cut in halves lengthwise; take out the yolks 
carefully and rub fine; season with pepper, salt, 
a little cayenne, a tablespoonful of prepared mus- 
tard, and three tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 
Mix all thoroughly together and fill the eggs with 
the mixture. Put the hi* Ives together and tie 
with a thread. If for picnic, tie with very narrow 
ribbon. DAISY M. EvEKAULL. 

STUFFED EGGS 

Cut a piece off of verv hard boiled eggs. For 



EGOS 134 

stuffinjj', use the yolks made very fine and some 
very finely chopped ham or veal, orbits of beef or 
dried beef, salt, pepper, a little dash of cayenne 
or ])epper sauce, butter and cheese. A few drops 
of onion juice or bottled mustard is ^ood. Any or 
all of these make verv good stuffing for eggs if 
properly mixed together. Stuff and fasten the 
end piece on with tooth -picks cut in two. If stuff- 
ed eggs or deviled eggs are to be served hot, dip 
in beaten egg, roll in cracker dust and fry in hot 
lard or put them on a tin j^late with some butter; 
put in what is left of the stuffing, sprinkle crack- 
er dust over and bake. Boneless sardines with the 
skin removed, minced fine, also oysters make 
good stuffing when mixed with the yolks. 

PICKLKD KGGS, NO. 1 

Boil eggs verv hard and remove the shell; take 
one teaspoonful each of cinnamon, allspice and 
mace, put in a little muslin bag in cold water, 
boil well and if it boils away, add enough to make 
one-half pint when the spices are taken out. Add 
one pint of strong vinegar; pour over the eggs. 
If you want them colored, put in a little beet 
juice. Another wav is to boil -six beets until ten- 
der using a little sugar in the water to cause 
them to keep their sweetness. Do not break the 
skin or thev will lose both their color and sweet- 
ness. When done, remove skins and slice. Boil 
one dozen eggs, remove vshells and add to the 
beets; while beets and eggs are still warm cover 
with good vinegar. Mrs. M. A. Marston.

to bind together. Have large gem pans well 
greased and nearl}^ fill with the mixture. Break 
an egg carefully on top of each one. Dust with 
salt and bake eight minutes. 

E(;GvS gn foam 

Break six or eight eggs; be careful not to break 
the yolks and beat the whites to a stiif froth; 
place them on a baking pan in a cone shape; make 
holes in the beaten whites and place the yolk in 
them. Sprinkle each yolk with white pepper, 
salt and bits of butter, put in slow oven a few 
minutes and serve hot. The whites should be 
beaten thoroughlv stiff. Hasten into the oven or 
the volks will sink into the whites too deep.

1 quart milk, 

Lemon rind or vanilla. 
Put the milk into a sauce-pan with rind of half 
a lemon and .sug^ar to sweeten nicely. Steep and 
bring- to the boiling' point. Beat the whites to a 
very stiff froth, adding a little salt and drop 
from spoon into the hot milk. Keep turning- each 
spoonful until cooked; place them on a glass dish 
add just a little more sugar and vanilla, pour the 
hot milk in the well beaten yolks, place this dish 
in a sauce-pan of boiling- water and stir it one 
way until the mixture thickens. Do not allow it 
to boil or it will curdle. Pour this custard over 
the whites; they should rise to the top. To be 
eaten cold or warm. 

Norma Ward Baker, Salem, Ore. 

SNOW BC^GS AND CUSTARD 

Break eight eggs, leaving out the whites of 
four; add to them when well beaten, one quart 
of milk and five ounces of vSUgar. Have a shallow 
pan of hot water in the oven, set the dish into it 
and bake until the custard is thick, then set away 
to cool. When cold, beat the remaining four 
whites to a stiff froth, add half a pound or coffee 
cupful of sugar and teaspoonful of lemon juice 
and lay the whites over the top in heaps but do 
not let them touch. 

HEN'S NKST 

Take the number of eggs you wish and make 
a hole in one end with a pin. Take out all the 
white and volk, fill the shells with a li(|uid blanc 
mange, stand each shell in a cup and put away to 
cool. Put some orange marmalade on a dish; 



137 EGGS 

when the blanc manj^-e ivS hardened, break off the 
v'ihells and stand the eggs whole in the center of 
the orange marmalade. This looks like a nest of 
eggs and is quite pretty on a supper table.

Omelettes, 

Comparativelv few of our houskeepers dare 
attempt to make an omelet, but there is nothing 
difficult about it. The chief cause of failure is in 
not having the spider or skillet hot enough or in 
making an omelet too large for the pan. Tin 
pans or frying pans should not be used as they 
are too thin and the omelet is liable to burn in 
spots. The spider should always be hot enough 



EGOS 138 

for the fat to instantly hiss. If butter is used 
for the pan, always use less salt in the omelet. 
The common rule is one egg for each person and 
nearl}" one teaspoonful of liquid to each egg; 
milk is generally used, cream is much better, or a 
few spoonfuls of hot water in case milk is jiot 
handy makes the omelet very tender. Never use 
more than four or five e«"^s for one omelet; if 
more is needed, better make two or more omelets; 
if too thin in the pan they are not good. The 
skillet or omelet pan should always be very 
smooth. 

PLAIN OMKLET 

Beat the yolks of four eggs to a cream; add 
three or four tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, 
one tablespoon ful of flour, just level full, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of salt, pepper to suit the 
taste. Beat the whites to a stiff froth and fold 
or beat (do not stir) them gently in. Have the 
skillet smoking hot; put in a tablespoonful of 
butter and then the mixture. Do not stir 
after it goes in. Cook over a moderate fire and 
do not allow it to scorch on the bottom, better 
set on top of lid if the stove be hot enough. 
As soon as set, cut in the middle and lay the two 
soft sides together or set in the oven on the grate 
two minutes to finish cooking. Serve hot. An- 
other way is to beat the whites and yolks of five 
eggs together thoroughly, add one tablespoonful 
of cream or milk and a little pe])per and salt. 
Pour the mixture in a hot buttered skillet and as 
soon as the omelet begins to thicken well, begin 
to roll it up from one side like a jelly roll and if 
there is any moisture in it, let it run down to the 
side or lower end and keep rolling until it is all 
rolled up; set skillet off, cover for five minutes.

PLAIN AND FANCY 0ME:LKTS 

When well made, omelets are a fine dish for 
breakfast or luncheon, a delicate lig^ht something 
that satisfies the appetite by its savoriness. 
Often broken bits of food remain, not enoug^h for 
a dish and yet too good to throw I'way. Here is 
where the omelet finds important uses. Bits of 
meat may be finely minced or sliced very thin, 
warmed two minutes in a little thin cream, bits 
of butter and a teaspoonful of flour then poured 
over the omelet either before or after folding it 
up. 

OMKLKT WITH ASPARAGUS TIPS 

Omelet with asparagus tips is made by cook- 
ing two cupfuls of asparagus tips in boiling water 
and a little salt; cook tender, drain and add a 
tablespooonful of sweet thick cream and minced 
parsley. Prepare and cook the omelet and pour 
the mixture over one half, then cut or turn the 
other half over it; take up the omelet and pour 
the balance of asparagus on and around it. 

VKGKTABLK OMELETS 

Young sweet peas make a delicate omelet. To- 
matoes, mushrooms, sweet corn and cheese may 
be added. Sweet corn is grated from the cob and 
cooked ten minutes in enough cream or milk to 
make it creamy. Cheese is grated and sprinkled 
over the top before serving. 

TOMATO OMELET 

Tomatoes thickened with bread crumbs, sea- 



EGOS 140 

soned with salt, pepper, chopped parsley and 
sug-ar. Add one e^g to ever}" pint of this mixture. 
Sprinkle bread crumbs over the top and bake 
forty minutes. A nice dinner dish. Another way 
is to beat up six eg"g"s, mix two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour with a little milk and add pepper 
and salt to taste. Peel and chop fine four toma- 
toes; stir all tog-ether and fry in butter. Oyster 
omelet may be made in the same way using 
03^sters instead of tomatoes. 

OYSTKR OMELKT, NO. 1 

Proceed as in plain omelet and just before fold- 
ing over, cover one-half with well drained oysters, 
season with salt and pepper and pour over them

and set in the oven for two or three minutes un- 
til the oysters are cooked through. 

OYSTER OMKLKT, NO. 2 

Stew one dozen oysters in their own liquor if 
possible, if not, use a very little water. Roll two 
or more lumps of butter si;:e of walnuts in flour; 
put in and let come to a boil; season well with 
pepper and salt. Takeout the oysters, chop them 
and if necessary to thicken, add a little flour to 
the sauce. Put back the ovsters and set .on the 
back part of the stove. Beat four eggs very light 
and add two tables])oonfuls of milk or cream. 
Fry in a well buttered frying pan. When done, 
remove to a hot platter or deep plate and pour 
the oyster sauce over them. Serve hot. 

SHRIMP ()melp:t 

Prepare the shrimps and stew in a little butter 



Ml EGGS 

for five minutes. Make an omelet with six or 
eight eggs and one half a cupful of cream; season 
with one spoonful of finely chopped parsely, salt 
and pepper. When done lay the shrimps on and 
fold over. Garnish with parsely. 

HAM OMKLKT 

3 eggs, 

4 tablespoonfuls butter, 

2 tablespoonfuls minced lean ham, 
Pinch of pepper. 
Fry the ham two minutes in a little butter. 
Then mix the other ing-redients all toge'ther and 
proceed as with a plain omelet. Serve very hot. 
Lean bacon or tongue will answer the same pur- 
pose and should be cooked slightly before mixing. 

OMELET WITH HKRBS 

Six eggs, 

}4 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 
Beat eggs in a bowl four minutes. Add one- 
quarter of a cupful of cream and again beat. Melt 
one-half of an ounce of butter in an omelet pan 
and when hot add the eggs. When they begin to 
thicken, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and 
spread the herbs over the vsurf ace. Fold and serve. 

BACHELOR'S OMELET 

Take one-third teacupful of milk — cream is 
better — add a tablespoonful of flour; mix well. 
Break four eggs, put the whites into a bowl, 
drop the yolks into the cup of flour and milk, add 
a pinch of salt to the whites and beat them stiff; 
beat the yolks and milk a little, then empty the 



EGOS 142 

cup into the bowl; beat a little. Put a tablespoon- 
ful of butter into the skillet; have it smoking hot; 
pour in the mixture; sprinkle with pepper. As 
soon as it is set enoug-h, turn it over or roll it up, 
let cook five or six seconds long^er and serve. If 
eg"u^s are scarce, use more milk and flour, but the 
more milk and flour used, the nearer the omelet 
gets to a pan-cake. A Bachelor. 

OMELET WITH CHEESE 

4 ecrcTs, 

^ cupful milk, 

1 teaspoonful flour, 

A little parsley, 

Yz teacupful j^rated cheese.

Beat the eggs very light and then add the other 
ingredients. Beat all well together and pour into 
a pan in which a large tablespocmful of butter is 
heated; let cook until light brown, then fold it 
over and dish for the table. Shake the pan while 
the omelet is cooking. Must be eaten as soon as 
removed from the stove. Miss WiSTER. 

RICE OMELET 

Beat half a cu])ful of boiled rice and a cui)ful 
of milk to a smooth paste and add two eggs well 
beaten. Salt and pepper to taste. Fry until 
brown, double, cover with sugar and serve at 
once. 

SWEET OMELETS WITH FRUITS 

These are excellent for lunch or dessert. For 



M3 EGGS 

raspberry omelets, make a syrup of one cupful of 
water and one-half cupful of .sujj-ar; boil ten min- 
utevS. When the omelet (from which pepper has 
been omitted) is ready, add to the hot syrup two 
cupfuls of ripe raspberries and a tablCvSpoonful of 
lemon juice; add half to the omelet, fold or roll 
up like a jelly cake, vslip on a platter and pour the 
rest of the mixture about it. Strawberries, black- 
berries. Loganberries, sliced bananas, oranges, 
grated pineapple or peaches, cut up, may be pre- 
pared satisfactorily in this way. 

JAM omkle:t 

Jam alone, or mixed with whipped sweet cream 
may be spread over the omelet, or dust the omelet 
with sugar and pour about it a portion of marma-

The wild varietv is much superior to the culti-

kinds are of many colors, some of them very 
beautiful, but like many other beautiful thinj^s, 
very danj^-erous. Those of a dead white al)ove 
and below are especially to be avoided. The skin 
can also be easilv peeled from the ed^es of a real

If you are still in doubt, stir them while cooking

be on the safe side if you throw them away.

TONGUE WITH SPANISH SAUCE 

(From "Crumbs from Everybody's Table.") 

One fresh beef tongue, one bottle of olives, 
two dozen large, clean, bright, dry Chili peppers, 
one teacupful (ordinary size) of best vinegar, or, 
better still, vSqueeze the juice of two lemons into 
the cup and fill with vinegar, one teaspoonful of 
powdered summer savory, two tablespoonfuls of 
finely chopped onion (should be small green 
onions, but dry will do), salt and olive oil as you 
like it. Some may, or will, try to make it with- 
out the oil. Do not wrste your time, for the oil 
is the secret of this delicious dish. Dissolve half 
a teacupful of vsalt in enough boiling water to 
cover the tongue, cook until done, and only done, 
or you will have rags. When cool, remove the 
skin and cut into very thin slices, and the tongue 
is ready for the sauce. Cut open the peppers the 
long way, take out every seed and vein, cut off 
the stem end, drop the skins into an agate kettle 
of boiling salted water (half cupful of salt). Press 



ENTREES, BREAKFAST AND LUNCHEON DISHES 166 

the skins under the water and keep at boiling heat 
for two hours, but the water must not even sim- 
mer, or 3'ou will find both taste and color g-one. 
Skim into chopping bowl — be sure all the water 
is pressed out — chop until you have a glowing 
mass of red pulp; press through a sieve to remove 
skins, and your sauce is read}^ to vseason. Do not 
put in all the salt needed, as the/ olives will add 
salt. Add oil and vinegar by the spoonful; no 
danger of curdling. Put olives in last. Dip each 
slice of tongue into the sauce, pile the slices into 
a deep dish and pour over them the remaining 
sauce; serve the next day on white platter and 
decorate with the small blanched stems of celery, 
which is exceedingly pretty against the red sauce. 
The sauce should be red and will be if your pep- 
pers grew the same year you make the sauce. It 
is delicious with roast turkey, cold ham, fried 
oysters, or with simpl)^ good bread. 

Mrs. U. Hartnell. 

ENCHILADAS 

(From "Crumbs from Everybody's Table.") 

To make the tortillas(orcakes)take three tea- 
cupf uls fiour, one cupful cold w^ater and a teaspoon- 
ful salt; mix into stiff dough, roll verv thin the 
size of a pie tin and bake on top of stove; pile one 
on top of another on a plate and cover with a nap- 
kin to keep soft. Take about one dozen dried 
Chili peppers, cut open and take out seeds and 
veins, put into agate kettle of boiling water, keep 
at boiling heat until peppers are soft. Press out 
water, and chop fine in a chopping bowl, then 
press through a sieve to remove skins. Put two 
liea])ing tal)les|)0()nfuls of lard in a frying pan; 
when hot, put salt, two cloves garlic cut fine and

mashed, one heaping tablespoonful flour fried 
brown, then add Chilis and sufficient boiling water 
to make thick sauce. Into this sauce while hot, 
dip one tortilla(or cake)at a time(they are better 
fried first in hot lard, but it is not necessary), 
place open on a large plate, spread on thick layer 
of grated cheese, a teaspoonful onion chopped 
fine, and strength taken out by soaking in hot 
water for a few moments, a layer of hard boiled 
eggs cut into slices, and four or five olives. Cover 
this with Chili sauce, roll, and put on a large 
platter. After all the enchiladas have been made, 
pour over them any remaining sauce, set platter 
into the oven and serve very warm.

TAMALES 

(From "Crumbs from Everybody's Table.") 

6 lbs. beef flank, 

1 lb. dried Chili peppers, 
5 lbs. white dried corn, 

2 teacupfuls of olives, 

1 teacupful of raisins, 

2 medium sized onions, 
8 cloves garlic, 

1 teaspoonful of summer savory. 
Boil meat in warm water seasoned wdth salt 
only until soft, too much boiling renders it taste- 
less; when done, cut in very small pieces and put 
into a kettle. Keep broth in which meat was 
boiled. Prepare Chili as for enchiladas, mash the 
garlic and put into Chili. Take two table- 
spoonfuls lard, w4ien very hot, fr}^ onions, add 
two tablespoonfuls flour, then fry brown and add 
Chili, salt and two teacupfuls of the gravy in 
which the meat was boiled; pour this into kettle 



ENTREES, BREAKFAST AND LUNCHEON DISHES 158 

of stew, then the savory well powdered, pepper, 
olives and raisins. If stew is not rich enough, add 
more gravy or hot water. Do not cook stew 
more than ten minutes. Put corn into kettle of 
cold water with one tablespoonful of lime. Taste 
water and if it bites the tong-ue it is strong enough ; 
boil until hull begins to peel; cool, then rinse in 
several waters rubbing between the hands until 
hull and kernel separate. Grind onametate, then 
put it into a pan, add salt and about one teacup- 
ful of very hot drippings, also remaining gravy. 
Wash corn husks and dry with a cloth; then on 
each husk spread about one tablespoonful of corn, 
fill with stew, cover with another husk spread 
with corn, tie on both ends and middle with 
small strips of the husks; trim off the ends. 
Cover bottom of a kettle with husks (to prevent 
tamales from burning) put tamales into it and 
pour over two quarts of hot water. Cover tight 
and steam about one hour; serve hot. The above 
measure will make about seven dozen tamales. If 
chicken is substituted for beef count on one chick- 
en for one and a half dozen tamales, but the chick- 
en should not be boiled. If a metate cannot be pro- 
cured a mortar can be used for grinding the corn.

SPANISH SAUCE 

(From "Crumbs from Everybody's Table.")

granite kettle. Cover with boiling water and add 
()ne-half cupful of salt. Let the peppers remain

der. Then drain, and chop until they are a fine 
pulp, press through sieve and put into a dish (not 
metal). Put back on stove, add vinegar and salt 
to taste, and allow to boil thoroug-hly. This 
should be of the consistency of catsup, so if it is 
too thick some water may be added. Bottle and 
seal while still hot. This makes an excellent sauce 
for cold meats; especially tongue. Before using 
mix with the sauce the juice of one lemon and a 
tablespoonful of olive oil. Pour this over the 
meat, which has been cut in thin slices, then add 
olives. MRvS. H. Samuels. 



6rdvks and Sauces. 



MKvS. J. S. Manlkv. 

Pew cooks understand that there are particular 
kinds of j^Tavies which go with particular kinds 
of meats, and that the rule which decides w^hat 
shall go with what is one to be strictly observed. 
With roast beef, for instance, there is but one 
permissible gravy, and that is made from the 
juices of the joint itself which come out of it in 
roastinj^. When the beef is taken from the oven 
remove all floating fat from the dripping pan, 
then add boiling water to the remainder, taking 
care not to dilute it too much, and allow it to 
l)oil up well. Serve hot in a gravy boat. For a 
pot roast a brown thickened gravy is in order, as 
also for roasted veal and pork. For roast lamb 
mint sauce is the right accompaniment. With 
game of different kinds jellies are usually served, 
as they are also with roast mutton. Red currant 
jelly goes with mutton, pork and turkey, and 
black currant jelly with hare or rabbit. Grape 
jelly may be substituted for the former if more 
convenient, and cranberry sauce or jelly with 
turkey and apple sauce with goovse is always the 
right accompaniment. Gravies for roast fowl of 
any kind should be brown and thick and rich, the 
giblets of the bird being cooked separately and 
the water in which thev are boiled forming the 
foundation of the gravv. For boiled veal and fowl 

Note,— 

Fur convenience, .some of the sauces belonging to this depart- 
ment have been placed in other parts of the book — the fish sauces 
with the fish, and pudding sauces in some instances. foHowing 
the puddings for which they are best suited. 



171 GRAVIES AND SAUCES 

a white vSauce — made of the stock in which the 
meat has been cooked with milk, flour and butter 
added — ^is the proper accompaniment. For fish, 
all vsorts of sauces are in order, the variety being 
almost as great as that of the dishes to be seasoned. 
The favorite is probably a tartare sauce, but 
oyster, shrimp, and anchovy sauces are all popular, 
and are equally in good form. The rule for gravies 
is always to serve them hot. A cold gravy is to 
the epicure nothing but an abomination. 

DRAWN BUTTER. 

Melted butter is the foundation of most of the 
common sauces. Have lined porcelain saucepan or 
a double boiler for this purpose. Take a quarter 
of a pound of fresh butter, cut it up and mix with 
it about one tablespoonful of flour. When it is 
thoroughly mixed, put it into a double boiler and 
add to it half a teacupful of hot water. Shake it 
around continually, till it is entirely melted and 
begins to vsimmer; then let it rest till it boils up. 
If y(m set on too hot fire it will be oily; if butter 
and flour are not well mixed it will be lumpy; if 
you put it in too much water it will be thin and 
poor. All these defects are to be carefully avoided. 
In melting butter for sweet or pudding sauce you 
mav use milk instead of water. 

CAPKR SAUCE. 

(For lioiled mutton. ) 

One pint of white sauce (made with stock), one 
tablespoonful of lemon juice, and three table- 
spotmfuls of capers; cook together and serve. For 
stock use that from the boiled mutton.

Puddings. 

Mrs. J. K. Turner. 



Fuddlngs hot ai)d puddings cold, 
Made by methods nftw and old, 
Partake, kind friends, quite moderately, 
I,est strange visions yon may see. 



In making- puddings the moulds or dishes in 
which they are cooked should be well buttered. 
Boiled puddings should be put in into boiling 
water and the water kept boiling steadily all the 
time; adding hot water, as the water in which 
the pudding is cooked evaporates. Not only the 
mould, but the kettle also must be closely cov- 
ered. If a bag is used, wring it out of hot water 
and flour it well; and when the pudding is done 
dip it into cold water, and it will come out 
easily; the same may be done with a mould. It 
takes nearly twice as long again to boil or steam 
as it does to bake. Raisins should be well dried 
lest the pudding be heavy; and for a quickly 
cooked pudding we think the raisins should be 
previously cooked.

"There's wisdom under the lift of the pie lid."— Lucullus. 



It is a poor pie crust that will not grease its 
own pan, therefore plent}^ of shortening should 
be Uvsed to make the crust tender and flaky. 
Nothing- is so good as pure cream for shortening, 
but butter or lard may be substituted. A small 
pinch of baking powder adds greatly to make the 
lightness and delicacy of the crust. Milk is to be 
preferred to water — as cold as possible. Mix 
with a fork and be sure not to make it too wet 
or too dry. Handle as delicately as possible and 
(juickly. 

APPLE PIE. 

Take four or five tart apples. Slice in rather 
large pieces; one cupful sugar. Line pie tin with

sugar over them, drop in a few lumps of butter 
and one teaspoonful cinnamon ; wet the edges and 
put on the upper crust; bake in a sharp oven.

Jellies, Jaws and tTlarmalades. 

Mrs. Geo. Scane. 



To be perfect, jam must be made of perfectly 
ripened fruit; jellies of that which is not quite 
ripe. The fruit should be carefully picked over, 
and all imperfect, very green, and badly crushed 
specimens rejected; also all stems and blossom 
ends, as these injure the flavor and clearness of 
the jelly. Never use tin or iron for cooking- fruit 
or iron spoons for stirring". Take the juice that 
has dripped from the fruit and pour it into the 
preserving- kettle; let it boil until it evaporates 
one-third (about twenty minutes), skimming" care- 
fully. Measure the juice (after boiling-) and add 
one pint of sugar to every pint of juice. Let it 
boil until, by trying a little on a plate, it appears 
to have "set." If the juice has been properly 
boiled seven or eight minutes is suflicient. Have 
the jelly glasses ready heated and set on a cloth. 
Pour the juice into them through a wine strainer 
or a wet cheese cloth tied over the lower end of 
a large-mouthed funnel. Fill the glasses full and 
let them stand open until the next day in the sun 
if possible. Before putting away pour over the 
top just enough melted parahne to cover and ex- 
clude the air. Put on the tin tops and set in a 
cold, dark place. Do not keep in the cellar or 
where there is the slightest danger of dampness. 



JELLIES, JAMS AND MAKMALADES 304 

When the jelly is used remove parafine; it may 
he used again another year; when this is used 
there is no danger of mold. Jelly can be made of 
all kinds of fruit juices, but not without some 
gelatine or apple juice. Neither of these will 
injure the natural flavor. Jelly made with 
gelatine will not keep very long. All fruit 
juices are better if apple juice is used with it, as 
this is clearer and of a beautiful light color. It 
also jells easier. The most simple way to strain 
fruit juices is to lay a large piece of cheese cloth 
over a hair sieve, setting the latter over a large 
bowl or jar. Then pour in the fruit gradually and 
let it drip through without pressing. If you press 
the fruit until the pulp is squeezed through you 
must not expect fine jelly. Jellies are of finer 
flavor when the sugar is not boiled long with the 
fruit. Make not less than a quart of juice at a 
time. Skim the juice just before filling the glasses 
and strain into them. Por three pints of juice 
use one pint of sugar, as a small amount of juice 
is apt to burn quickly. It is best to place the 
vessel containing such within a larger vessel of 
boiling water. You can thus cook more evenly 
without running the risk of burning. 

BLACKBERRY JELLY. 

Cook fruit, strain through a cloth and let set-

Truit Canning. 

Mrs. Fred Nelson. 



None but perfectly sound and fresh fruit should 
be used for canning; fruit can be canned with or 
without sugar. It should not be cooked too long, 
as that will destroy its natural flavor, and while 
boiling hot should be sealed in air tight glass jars 
or tin cans, filled to overflowing to exclude every 
particle of air, then quickly seal. When using 
glass jars they should be thoroughly heated be- 
fore filling. After filling and closing stand the 
jars in a warm place, where the air will not 
strike them over night. In the morning you will 
be able to give the tops another turn; then wipe 
the jars carefully and put them away in a cool, 
dark place; a good plan is to wrap them in paper. 

STEAMING PROCESS. 

Pack the jars or cans full of fruit; pour over 
them a s.yrup of the strength you prefer— a cup- 
ful sugar to a quart of water will make a strong 
syrup. Screw the covers on lightly, or so you 
can lift the jar by its top. Have a board made to 
fit the bottom of the boiler and raised by cleats 
from the bottom an inch or so. Set the jars on 
this board, fill the boiler with warm water until 
it reaches a little more than half height of jar; 



FRUIT CANNING 314 

cover the boiler ti<yht and steam until fruit is 
cooked sufficiently. Ten minutes is sufficient for 
berries, countinjj^ from the time the water beg^ins 
to boil; about tvvent}^ minutes for Orangfe |Clings 
and other firm fruits. A little practice will in- 
sure success and the table g-iven here will be 
helpful. When the fruit is cooked sufficiently take 
the jars out, remove cover and fill with a boiling 
svrup (keep it on the back of the stove so it will 
be ready). Repla;ce cover quickly and screw on 
top as tight as possible. Set jars in a warm 
place; avoid drafts. If possible, let them remain 
several hours until thoroug^hly cool without mov- 
\v\^. When using the Mason jar it is well to turn 
it upside down until cool, anv defect can then be 
easilv be detected — always use new rubbers. This 
steaming process has so many advantages over 
the old process that all who give it a thorough 
test are sure to prefer it. There is no more dan- 
g-er of breaking jars than by the old method. 
When taking jars out of the boiling water if set 
into a pan of boiling water or on the stove all 
will be well. Do not set them by an open window 
or in a cool place. The only secret about it is to 
keep the temperature the same, remembering- to 
cool very slowly. 

CANNING. 

A good general rule in canning fruit is to use 
one pound of sugar to four pounds of fruit, and 
barely enough water to keep from burning when 
first put over. To be more exact, the following

CANNED STRAWBERRIES. 

All berries are canned after much the same 
fashion. Either use one or the other of the two 
rules ^iven at the beg^innino^ of this department, 
or proceed as follows: Put the berries in a por- 
celain kettle; heat slowly. As they commence 
boiling add sugar according- to the foreg'oing' 
table; if strawberries, boil eig^ht or ten minutes 
before putting in sug-ar; dip out any extra juice. 
Can hot and seal at once. 

CANNED RASPBERRIES. 

Look the berries over carefully and put them 
into a porcelain kettle. Put enoug-h water so you 
can see it through the berries. Sweeten as you 
would for a stew, and can and seal boiling hot. 



FRUIT CANNING 316 

Gooseberries, plums, cherries and all small fruit 
are to be canned this way, care beintr taken that 
the cans are hot and fruit boiling. 

CANNP^D PIK PLANT. 

Cut m inch pieces and stew with its own 

weig-ht of su<j^ar slowly until tender; add only 

water enough to dissolve su^ar. Seal up. Can 
without sug^ar if more convenient. 

CANNED PUMPKIN. 

Steam the pumpkin; first slicino^ and removing 
seeds; leave in the shell. When done, scrape from 
the shell; mash; fill into cans hot, being careful 
that no air bubbles remain in filling the can; seal 
up. 

CANNED QUINCES. 

Cut the quinces into thin slices like ap])les for 
pies. To one quart jarful quince take a cofFee- 
saucer and a half of sugar and a coffeecupful 
water. Put the sugar and water on the fire and, 
when boiling, put in the quinces. Have ready 
the iars with their fastenings. Stand the jars in 
a pan of boiling water on the stove, and when 
the quince is clear and tender put rapidly into 
jars, fruit and syrup together. The jars must be 
filled so that the syrup overflows and fastened 
up tight as quickly as possible. 

CANNED APPLES. 

Apples can be canned by stewing them well 
done, with or without sugar, and sealing them 
up while hot. 



317 FRUIT CANNING 

ISABKLLK GRAPKvS. 

Take fully ripe and sound o"rapes, pick from 
the stems and pulp them bv pressing slightly 
with the thumb and finger upon each one. Put 
the skins in a separate dish; then beat the pulp 
and press through a coarse cloth or sieve to re- 
move the seeds; then put the juice and skins to- 
gether in your kettle and when thev come to a 
boil they are ready for the cans; secure well from 
the air. It matters not whether glass, cans or 
jars are used, if properly corked and sealed with 
wax. 

BOILED APPLES. 

Prepare apples as you would to bake, remov- 
ing the cores; put them in a kettle and fill the 
center with sugar, nearly cover with water and 
allow to boil till tender. Remove them to an 
earthen bowl; boil down the svrup and pour it 
over the apples. 

CANNED TOMATOES. 

Scald with boiling water, peel and cut into 
small pieces. Cook until done; seal up while hot. 
Are kept much better in tin cans than in jars. 

CANNED PLUMS. 

To ever}" pound of fruit allow three-quarters 
of a pound of sugar, for the thin syrup, a quarter 
of a pound of sugar to a pint of water. Select 
fine fruit and prick with a needle to prevent 
bursting. Simmer gently in asyrup made of the 
above proportion of sugar and water. Let them 



f-RUIT CANNING 318 

boil not longer than five minutes. Put the plums 
in ajar, pour in the hot syrup and seal. Green 
g"a^es are also delicious done in this manner. 

CANNED PINKAPPIvK. 

Pare the fruit, takinjj- out all the eyes and 
discolored parts; cut in slices; take out the core; 
weig-h the fruit and put in a pan with one-fourth 
as many pounds of sugar as of fruit; let it stand 
over nitrht. In the morning pour the juice into a 
preserving kettle; set over the fire and let come 
to a boil; put in the pineapples and let cook a few 
minutes; v^eal uj) in tin cans. 

Mrs. Chas. Nelson. 

PRESERVED PLUMS. 

Take fruit and sugar jjound for pound; scald 
the plums to remove the skins; or if left unpeeled 
])rick each one in several places that the juice 
may exude; let it stand; drain and put the plums 
in the kettle with alternate layers of sugar. Pour 
the juice over this and let them boil five minutes, 
then remove the plums with a skimmer and boil 
the syrup until it thickens. Return the plums and 
boil ten minutes longer. Put in jars and tie up 
closely when cold. Mrs. Fr?:d Nelson. 

PRESERVED PEARS. 

Pare, core and quarter the fruit, and to each 
pound of pears take one-half pound sugar. Save 
the perfect cores and skins and boil them in suf- 
ficient w'ater to cover. Strain this and put the 
sugar in; let boil and add the prepared fruit; stew 
gently until the syrup becomes colored finely; 



319 KRUIT CANNING 

can and seal immediately. Any syrup remaining 
over may be bottled for pudding sauce. 

PEACH PRESERVES. 

Six pounds of best freestone peaches and three 
pounds vsugar; pare and quarter the fruit; strew 
the sugar amongst it; cover and set away over 
night. Put into a preserving kettle in the morn- 
ing and boil very slowly an hour or more. Seal 
hot. Mrs. Amos Harris. 

PRESERVED CURRANTS. 

10 pounds currants, 

7 pounds sugar. 
Take stems from seven pounds currants, press 
juice from the other three pounds. When sugar 
is made into hot syrup put in currants and boil 
until thick and rich. 

TO PRESERVE ORANGES. 

Eirst weigh the fruit; then grate them slightlv; 
score them around and around, not too deep. 
Soak in cold water three days, changing the 
water at least three times a day; then boil the or- 
anges until they are done; try by piercing with 
the head of a pin — when done the head of the pin 
penetrates easily. Make a syrup of a little more 
than a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit (make 
the syrup very thick), then drop the oranges in. 
Let them cook until done. 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES. 

To one ])Ound of berries use three-fourths of a 



KKUIT CANNING 320 

pound of suj^ar in layers (no water). Place in a 
kettle on the back of the stove until the sug"ar is 
dissolved into syrup; then let come to aboil, stir- 
ring from the bottom. Spread on platters and set 
out in the sun until the S3'rup thickens. Put in 
tumblers like jelly. 

RIPK TOMATO PRKSKRVES. 

Sev^en pounds round, yellow tomatoes, peeled; 
seven pounds sug-ar, juice three lemons. Let 
stand over night together; drain off syrup and 
boil, skimming well, then put io the tomatoes and 
boil gently twenty minutes. Take out fruit with 
a skimmer and spread on dishes. Boil syrup down 
until it thickens, adding just before you take it 
off the fire the juice of the lemons. Put the fruit 
into jars and fill up with hot vsyrup. When cold 
seal up. Emma Wallace. 

WATKRMKLON PRESERVES. 

Pare the watermelon rinds and cut an inch and 
one-half thick, then into strips the same thick- 
ness, leaving them the full length of the melon. 
To each pound of melon put one pound of sugar 
and one pint of water, make a syrup and simmer 
gently for twenty minutes, then put in the melon 
and cook until tender; before taking off the fire 
put in two lemons sliced thin and two ounces of 
root ginger. Do not let them boil long after the 
lemon and ginger are put in; do not stir them 
while boiling. A nice improvement is to add one 
pound of raisins just before the fruit is taken from 
the stove. 



321 KkUIT CANNING 

APPLP; PRKSKRVES. 

Take three-fourths pound sugar to each pound 
apples. Make a syrup of the sugar and a little 
lemon juice or sliced lemon peel; cut your 
apples in c^uarters and put a few at a time into 
the syrup and boil until they are transparent; 
skim out and put in ajar; when all are done boil 
the syrup down thick, pour it boiling hot over 
the apples and cover closely. 

CRAB APPLK PRKSERVKS. 

Core the crab apples with a sharp penknife 
through the blossom end, leaving the stem on. 
Take one pound of white sugar for each pound of 
fruit, and one cupful water to the pound; put over 
a moderate fire; let dissolve and boil. Skin and 
drop the apples in; skim out; boil. the syrup until 
thick and pour over the fruit. 

QUINCE PRESE)RVES. 

Pare, core and quarter your fruit; then weigh 
it and allow an equal quantity of white sugar; 
take the paring and cores and put in a preserving 
kettle; cover them with water and boil for half 
an hour, then strain and put the juice back into 
the kettle and boil the quinces in it a little at a 
time until they are tender. Lift out as they are 
done and lay on a dish. If the liquid seems scarce 
add more water. When all are cooked put into 
this liquor the sugar and allow it to boil ten min- 
utes before putting in the quinces; let them boil 
until they change color, say one hour or more, on 
a vslow fire. While they are boiling occasionally 
slip a silver spoon under them to see that they do

fresh lemons cut in thin slices, and when the fruit 
is being- put in jars lay a slice or two on each. 
Quinces may be stewed until tender. 

FIG PRESERVES. 

Remove the skin from the figs at night and 
sprinkle sugar over the top, allowing two pounds 
of sugar to five of fruit. In the morning put over 
a slow fire and cook until thick. Cut up a lemon 
and while cooking- add to the flavor. 

GRAPE PRESERVES. 

Make a syrup of sugar and water, allowing one 
pound of sugar to one of fruit, using just enough 
water to melt the sugar. When boiling have 
your grapes picked from the stem and washed 
clean; put into the boiling syrup and boil until 
thick and of a redish color. Seedless Sultana 
grapes are the best. 

FIG MARMALADE. 

5 {)ounds figs, 

7 pounds sugar, 

6 lemons, pulp and juice, 

4 oranges, pulp and juice. 
Chop the figs; grate the yellow part of the

COOKING DRIKD FRUIT. 

Put the fruit to soak over night. In the morn- 
ing pour off the water; cover again with cold 
water and place on the stove. After it comes to 
aboil pour off the water two or three times; cook 
very slowly, three or four hours. And the fruit 
will taste just like canned fruit. Pouring off the 
water so many times destroys the strong flavor 
of dried fruit and does not make it tasteless, as 
one might think.

Trozen Dainties. 

Mrs. a. Mattel 



As much of the success of frozen dainties de- 
pends on properly packing the freezer, directions 
should be carefully followed. Have the freezer, 
can and dasher clean and sweet. See that can 
and dasher are properly adjusted in the pail, 
then put in the mixture to be frozen; cover and 
put on cross bar or top plate and turn the crank 
to see that everything- is in its right place and 
works properly. Crush the ice by putting it in a 
sack made of canvas and with a wooden maul 
pound it — the finer it is broken the more closely 
it will pack around the can, and the more rap- 
idlv it freezes; then fill the pail of freezer with 
alternate layers of ice and salt, which should be 
coarse, using three measures of ice to one of 
salt. More salt will freeze the cream sooner, but 
it will not be as smooth. Pack ice and salt 
solidly by using the handle of maul to force the 
ice down. Remember that if the ice is packed 
solid at first no more ice and salt will be needed. 
Do not draw off the water in pail but keep the 
hole near the top of the pail open to allow it to 
run off when necessary and prevent the salt 
water from getting into the cream. Be sure that 
ice and salt cover can if the can is three- fourths 
full; if less than that it is higher in pail than 



l-ROZeN DAINIIES 332 

mixture is in can. As freezing increases the bulk 
of mixture, never fill can more than three-fourths 
full, and if white of egtrs are used, only two- 
thirds. Now. in freezing-, first turn the crank 
slowly and steadily till the mixture is frozen to 
a mush; then more rapidly, and if necessar}^ add 
more salt and ice. If properly packed, it will 
take from twenty to thirty minutes to freeze. 
Water ices require a longer time than ice creams. 
When frozen, remove the crank, wipe the lid of 
can carefully, so when it is removed no salt will 
get into the cream, take out dasher and with a 
wooden paddle scrape the cream from sides of 
can and beat and work it a few minutes. This 
makes the cream smooth; now put the lid on 
the can, putting a cork in the hole where the 
dasher was taken from; drain off the water, 
repack with ice and salt, cover with a piece of 
heavy wrapping paper, then with an old piece of 
carpet, and put awav in a cool place for two or 
three hours to ripen. 

To mould and pack frozen dainties the mixture 
should not be frozen too hard, if to be moulded, 
and before packing take a long handled spoon, 
stir down the mixture thoroughly; have your 
mould chilled by packing it in salt and ice before 
filling; now fill the mould, being careful to fill 
every corner if a square one is used; if fancy, 
that all of the design is packed solid; then fill the 
mould so full that when covered the mixture is 
forced down the sides; put on a piece of waxed 
or buttered paper, "buttered side up," then the 
cover to the mould — see that it fits accurately. 
Pack into tub or pail with ice and salt (using 
four measures of ice to one of salt) so that the 
mould is entirely covered with ice; set away from 
two to three hours. To serve take mould from 



333 FROZEN DAINTIES 

salt water and hold under cold water faucet; let 
it run one minute to rinse off the salt; wipe the 
mould, remove the cover and paper; invert on 
serving- dish and the frozen mixture will fall out. 
Should it fail to do so, wring- a cloth from hot 
water and spread it over the mould a moment; 
nev^er dip a mould in hot water. 

Frozen mixtures are classified as ice creams, 
water ices, g^ranites. sherbets, frappe, punch, 
sorbet and mousse. 

Philadelphia Ice Cream — A thin cream, 
sweetened and flavored, and, without cooking, 
frozen. 

Neapolitan Ice Cream — Made of rich 
cream, eg^g^s, sug-ar and flavoring', cooked into a 
delicate custard. 

Water Ices — Juice of fruit diluted with 
water and sweetened, there being- two ways in 
which to prepare it — one by cooking sug-ar and 
water then cooling- it, which gives body to the 
ice, and it does not melt as quicklv when served; 
the other simply to mix the ingredients and 
freeze. 

Granites — A water ice to which small fruit 
or large fruit cut into small squares and mixed 
in with as little stirring as possible when the ice 
is nearly frozen. 

ShERBERTvS — A water ice to which the white 
of an egg has been added when ice begins to 
thicken and served in small tumblers or lemonade 
glasses. 

pRAPPE — A water ice frozen to a mush, using 
equal parts of salt and ice in freezing, which 
make it granular. 

Punch — A water ice to which spirits and 
sometimes spices are added. 

Sorbet — When several kinds of fruit juices 



FROZEN DAINTIES 334 

are used it is sometimes called sorbet, but it is 
really a frozen punch. 

Mousse — A mould lined with an ice and 
whipped cream, sweetened, used as a filling and 
packed in ice and salt and not disturbed for three 
hours,

BAKED OR ALASKA ICE CREAM. 

Take a silver platter or any dish which will 
not break in the oven; cover bottom with lad}" 
fingers, or any other cake; put your ice cream, 
any kind, on top of cake, only see that ice cream 
is well frozen. Have by this time whipped the 
whites of vsix eggs to a very thick froth, have on 
a plate one pound of powdered sugar, mix sugar 
carefully with froth, now cover ice cream with 
half of this; take the other in a pastry bag; gar- 
nish over all and bake in a very hot oven ten or 
fifteen seconds till a nice brown, send to table 
immediately. (A very nice surprise.)

ALMOND ICE CREAM. 

1 quart cream, 

4 ounces shelled almonds, 

1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract, 

A few drops each of rose water and bitter 

almond extract. 
Blanch almonds, pound to a paste adding a 
few drops of rose water and bitter almond and a 
very little cream gradually. Heat cream in a 
double boiler till steaming hot (not boiling), melt 
sugar in it, set aside and when cold add almond 
paste. Freeze and pack. Nut ice cream requires a 
longer time to freeze.

CURRANT ICE. 

4 cupfuls of water, 
1-j; cupfuls sugar, 

2% cupfuls currant juice. 
Boil water and sugar ten minutes; add currant 
juice, cool and freeze. Serve in tall glasses; 
garnish with red and white currants. 

LEMON ICE. 

For every quart of ice desired take two small 
teaspoonf uls of corn starch, place in cold water 
and boil slowly till all taste and smell of the 
starch has been removed, taking care to prevent 
burning on the bottom by stirring frequently. 
To this add, while hot, the juice of two medium 
sized (or one and one-half large) lemons for each 
quart. If the sliced rind of one or more lemons 
is added to the whole the qualit}' is for many 
palates, much improved; strain the material 
through a fairly fine colander, and while it is 
still warm add sufficient sugar to sweeten to 
taste; remembering, however, that lemon be- 
comes more acid in cooling and the material 
should therefore, when warm, be somewhat over 
sweet. Freeze and serve precisely as with ice 
cream. (It should be remembered that very 
much of the delicacy of the ice depends upon the 



339 FROZEN DAINTIES 

vsuccess with which all trace of the starch is dis- 
pelled in boiling-.)

cream of tartar. Stir until the sugar is nearly 
melted; then place on the fire and heat slowly, 
but do not stir. Watch carefully and note 
whed it begins to boil. When the sugar has been 
boiling for ten minutes take a little of it and 
drop in ice water. If it hardens enough to form 
a soft ball when rolled between finger and thumb

it is cooked enough. Remove saucepiin from the 
tire and when the syrup stops boiling pour into a 
large platter and set in a cool place. When the 
syrup is so cool that the finger can be held in it 
comfortably, stir with a wooden spoon or ])addle 
until it becomes thick and white. When it begins 
to look hard and a little dry, remove spoon and 
knead with hands until the cream is smooth and 
soft. Work the flavoring in a little at a time. 
If the candy becomes hard and crumbly, it means 
that it has been cooked too long. Dampen the 
candy with a very little water and knead as be- 
fore. By combining this fondant with figs, 
prunes or citron a variety of creams may be 
made. Harriet M. Stout.

POP CORN BALLS. 

Pop the corn and reject all that is not nicely 
opened. Place a half bushel on a table or drip- 
ping pan. Put a little water in a suitable kettle 
with one pound of sugar and boil until it becomes 
quite waxy in cold water. Remove from fire and 
dip into it six or seven tablespoonfuls of gum 
solution made as thick as molasses by pouring 
boiling water on gum arabic and letting stand 
over night. Pour mixture over corn, putting a 



357 CANDY 

stick or handvS under the corn, lifting- it up and 
mixing until it is all saturated; let stand a few 
moments, then flour the hands slightly and press 
into balls. This amount will make one hundred 
pop corn balls, such as the street peddlers sell, 
but for home eating omit the gum solution and 
use a half pint of stiff taffy made as above, for 
one peck of popped corn. This will make twenty 
rich balls.

rolling pin; cut out the peppermints; melt the 
chocolates and dip the peppermints, holding 
them on the end of a fork; set on wax paper to 
cool. 



Tood for Invalids. 

Mrs. L,. D. Howard. 



Kndeavor to tempt the appetite of the patient 
by attention to little things. Give the distaste- 
ful food the resemblance of something- that is 
particularh^ palatable. Cover the tra}' in a dainty 
manner with the freshest of cloth; render it 
bright with a vase of flowers. Do not set a plate 
before an invalid containing the exact quantity of 
meat, fish or anything you wish him to eat. Serve 
everything on small dishes and allow the patient 
to help himself. Very often the effort to lift the 
head, even if the person is not dangerously ill, 
disinclines them to take refreshing or nourishing 
drink. Do not disturb such sufferers by propping 
them up with pillows and making them lift their 
heads and change their position. Secure a bent 
glass tube and the patient need not be disturbed, 
in a sick headache or extreme fatigue, but can 
take the beverage provided without a change of 
position. As the system feels the need of the very 
thing that the taste demands, satisfy that desire 
as far as possible; but the greatest care is neces- 
sarv with regard to food; therefore, give no new 
article of diet without the express permission of 
the physician. 



359 _ FOOD POR INVALIDS 

CONCENTRATED FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 

Bartholow's Food, first made by Dr. Bartho- 
low, of Philadelphia, ivS better known to nurses 
than to others. It is a very concentrated food, 
useful in nourishing a patient who is on a liquid 
diet. 

SAGO FOR INVALIDS. 

1 cupful beef tea, 

2 level tablespoonfuls sago, 
1 yolk of egg-, 

1 cupful sweet milk, 
Salt to suit. 
The sago is given for the starch it contains, 
arrowroot and sago being the most easily' digested 
form of starch. In making the food, first put the 
sago in the milk; heat until the grains swell and 
thicken the milk; stir frequently, and if possible 
cook in a double boiler. Do not scorch. When 
cooked, it vshould look clear; take from the fire, 
stir in the cup of beef tea, beat in the yolk of the

does not afford as much nutrition as people have 
been led to believe. It is readil}" taken up by ab- 
sorption and is desirable where a mild stimulant 
is required. Notwithstanding- it has been repeat- 
edly shown that beef tea is not a food, the laity, 
and to a considerable extent, the profession, are 
slow to be convinced. That patients fed on beef 
tea slowly starve, is a fact which the analysis 
only too conclusively proves and which is sus- 
tained by accurate clinical observation. Beef tea, 
most carefully prepared, says Dr. Neal in a 
medical journal (Nov. 1881), does not contain, in- 
cluding alkaline salts, more than from 1.5 to 
2,25 per cent solid matter. Asa stimulant, beef 
tea may be and often is highl}^ serviceable, but 
as a means of support during- the exhausting- 
drain of a long illness, it does not compare in 
nutritive value to milk. Dr. Lander Brunton 
raises the question whether beef tea, a product 
of muscular waste, may not, under some circum- 
stances, be actually poisonous.

*' * * * The growth of Vegetarianism in 
the United States is gradual, but persistent. " — 
Ex. And The Raisin Center Cook Book would 
not be up to modern requirements without a de- 
partment devoted to meatless dishes. Meat is 
not a necessity, so it is not necessary to have 
anything to take its place; but since we are in the 
habit of thinking that a meal is incomplete with- 
out meat, we find it easier to drop into "the bet- 
ter way," if the platter is filled with something 
that looks like meat. So 3'ou will find in this de- 
partment a few recipes for something to fill the 
platter which should be accompanied by soup, 
vegetables, side dishes, relishes and daint}' des- 
serts, usualU" served with a meat dinner, the 
recipes for which will be found in the other de- 
partments of the cookbook. But do not discard

meat and attenrpt to live on white bread, butter, 
tea and crackers. If you do you will soon find 
3'ourself all run down and think, at once, that 
you must ^o back to a meat diet to reg-ain your 
strength. If, on the contrary, you desire to give 
it a fair trial, go about it understandingly and 
have 3'our store closet tilled with such things as 
will supplv the needs of the body. It has been 
conclusively proved bv actual experiment that the 
same food values can be obtained from nuts and 
fruits as from a meat diet, as astud)^ of the table 
of food values will show. Professor Atwater, in 
his report to the Agricultural Department, says: 
"There is a general awakening to the needs of 
dietarv improvement, but in order to bring this 
about experts are required. These should not be 
mere cooks, or even chefs, but persons of 
thorough scientific and practical training. The 
calling is especially adapted to women who have 
the natural gifts and opportunities to secure the 
necessary education." Kach house mother, then, 
must be her own judge; whether she will stick 
to the old ways, with their burden of work, 
worry and ill health, or open her eyes to modern 
scientific discoveries. 

Something for the Platter, 



Here is a formula which can be varied indefi- 
nitely, using apples or vegetables in place of 
nuts: 

NUT CROQUETTES. 

1 cupful thinly sliced walnut meats (or any 
nuts preferred). 



371 MEALS WITHOUT MEAT

bread crumbs, with sugar, salt and pepper; then 
the milk, stirring constantly. Remove from the 
stove; add the nuts and last, the well beaten ^^^, 
mixing all thoroughly together. Make into balls 
of an}'^ desired size or shape, dip in ^^^ batter, 
roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot olive oil 
(Gower's). Have two or three bananas peeled 
and cut in thirds, or apples cut in eighths, dip in 
batter and fry in the same oil. Arrange on hot 
platter with croquettes in center and bananas or 
apples around the edge. Klizabkth.

VKGKTABLK POT PIE. 
(For a Family of Six.) 

Put a good sized lumj) of butter or two table- 
spoonfuls Gower's olive oil into the pot; when it 
is hot put in a finely minced onion and let it fry 
for fifteen or twenty minutes; don't let it scorch 
the least bit, but just turn a delicate brown; pour 
in three pints of boiling water; add salt and 
pepper to taste. Have ready two carrots cut in 
quarters lengthwivse, three parsnips cut in quar- 
ters lengthwise and six potatoes cut into pieces 
crosswise. Put in vour carrots first, then your 
parsnips; when they have boiled fifteen minutes, 
add your potatoes, and on top of all vour dump- 
lings. (Recipe for Dumplings^ — -Two cupfuls flour, 
two teaspoonfuls baking powder and a good 
pinch salt, sifted together, wet with sufficient 
milk to make a stiff dough.) Cover closely and 
keep the pot boiling for half an hour; then it 
will be ready to dish up on the platter (have the 
platter hot so as not to sodden the dumplings). 
Take out the dumplings carefully with fork and 
spoon, and around them arrange the vegetables. 
To the water in the pot add a heaping table-

cooked. 

Mix oil and flour; place over the fire and stir 
until well browned; add water; stir until smooth 
and well cooked. Remove from the fire; add salt 
and pepper to taste and your chopped vegetables 
with a little grated onion. This mixture should 
be the consistency of stiif mush. Put two-thirds 
of this mixture m a baking dish, and with a 
spoon spread it over the bottom and half way up 
the sides; have ready a dressing of bread crumbs, 
vsuch as you UvSe for turkey or meat roast; pour 
this into your baking dish and cover by spread- 
ing the other third of the mixture over top, mak-

the shells, add a teaspoonful salt and a pinch 
thyme, and mix thoroughly. Boil together a 
large turnip, one carrot, two large potatoes, two 
stalks celer)^ three pepper corns and two cloves. 
When the vegetables are tender, drain through a 
colander; add chestnuts; mash all together, add- 
ing two tablespoonfuls each of butter and cream. 
Salt to taste, place in a buttered mould, in a hot 
oven; heat thoroughly and serve on a meat plat- 
ter, garnished with slices of lemon and sprigs of 
parsley. 

VEGETABLE TURKEY, NO. 2. 

Boil a large egg plant until tender; peel it, 
mash it smooth, season with salt and pepper, add 
a tablespoonful butter and a pound of chestnuts 
prepared as above, also two hard boiled eggs 
chopped fine, half an onion chopped, and a cup- 
ful fine bread crumbs. Mix well, pack closely in 
a buttered dish; heat thoroughly in a hot oven 
and serve on a platter garnished with sliced to- 
matoes. 

LENTIL CUTLETS. 

Soak a cupful lentils over night in cold water. 
In the morning drain off this water and let the 
lentils cook ver}' slowly till tender; drain through 
colander; add pint chestnuts prepared as for the 
turkey, but without the thyme. Add three table- 
spoonfuls of butter, half a cupful milk and salt 
and pepper to taste. Mix well and pour .into in- 
dividual serving dishes. Serve hot, with a little

whipped white of an egg on top. In making- vege- 
tarian substitutes for meats chestnuts should 
always be used, since they have a divStinctly 
meat}^ flavor in conjunction with vegetables. 

NUTTOSE TIMBALES. 

Boil large-sized macaroni in salted water until 
tender. When cold cut it into inch bits and mix 
■^ith prepared chestnuts, then with a sauce made 
of one tablespoonful each of butter and flour, half 
a cupful of milk, and salt and pepper to taste. 
Just before removing the sauce from the fire, add 
three well beaten eggs. Mix with the prepared 
nuttose and pour into a well buttered mould. 
Place this in a pan of hot water and let it stand 
in a slow oven for twenty minutes. Serve the 
timbales on a round dish garnished wnth cress 
and mushrooms. 

NUT BUTTER. 

Take half a pound of roasted peanuts, ground 
or chopped, one ounce of blanched and dried 
almonds, half a pound of pecans, andhalf a pound 
pine nuts. Add six ripe bananas, sliced; pack 
closely into a mould and let steam for one hour. 
Allow the mixture to cool before turning it out 
of the mould. It is delicious spread between sand- 
wiches, or served in slices with mayonaise dress- 
ing. Mrs. E. Turner. 

RAISINA PASTE. 

Equal parts seeded raisins and dried figs. 
Carefully wash the dried figs, and with the scis- 
sors clip off the stem end; run them through the 



377 MEALS WITHOUT MEAT 

handmill, alternating a handful of figs with a 
handful of raisins, which is an easy way of mix- 
ing them together. Now roll into a ball and from 
the mass, with a wet spoon, cut out pieces one- 
half size of a walnut, roll them in almond crumbs 
and dry on plates in the sun for half a day and 
they are ready to store in jars for every day use. 
This paste can be varied by using dried apples in- 
stead of figs and bread crumbs instead of almonds. 

CROUTONS. 

Cut stale bread into one-half inch dice and dry 
in oven. When wanted for use pour in hot butter 
or olive oil (Gower's). 

TO PREPARE BRKAD CRUMBS. 

Put the broken pieces, heels, etc. into dripping 
pan, put in dr\'ing oven and leave until thorough- 
ly dry and slightly brown. (This turns the flour 
into wheat farina, giving it a nutty flavor and 
making it more digestible.) Now run through 
the "grinder" and store away in covered jars 
for future use, 

TO BLANCH ALMONDS. 

Shell, pour boiling water over them, cover 
and let stand five minutes; pour off the hot water 
and dash on cold, drain and you will have no 
trouble in removing the skin by rubbing between 
the thumb and finger. 

ALMONDS FRIED IN OLIVE OIL. 

Shell, but do not blanch the almonds, put two 
tablespoonfuls oHve oil (Gower's) into your fry- 



MEALS WITHOUT MEAT 378 

mg pan; when it is hot put in a cupful almonds. 
You must be very careful about burning as the 
least scorch will destroy the delicate flavor. Stir 
constantly for five or seven minutes, then while 
hot drain ofF the oil and sprinkle with salt. The 
oil drained off can be used in soups or stews. 
Almond crumbs can be made by grinding fried 
almonds. 

Jl Word JIbout Soups Without Itleat. 



Soup without meat requires far less time for 
cooking. It can be added to the dinner at only a 
few minutes notice, and when rightly made is so 
delicious as to become its own excuse for being. 
Here is a formula for 

SOUP STOCK WITHOUT MEAT. 

Put in a frying pan one tablespoonful butter 
and one tablespoonful olive oil (Gower's); when 
warm add two tablespoonfuls finel}' minced on- 
ion; when the onion is cooked until slightly yel- 
low stir in one spoonful of flour, continue to stir 
and cook for five minutes, then add slowly a pint 
boiling water; now to this add your prepared 
tomatoes, celery, split pea or whatever you may 
have planned. When sufficiently cooked put all 
through a fine seive, return to the fire, add boil- 
ing milk or cream. Serve hot with freshly panned 
croutons or crackers. 

medicinal Properties of Vegetables, 



Diet instead of drugs is becoming a more and 
more popular method of medication as we become

more aware of the beneficial effects of the various 
plants and fruit on the system, and it is certainly 
far more agreeable to eat a fine ripe orang^e or 
peach than to take a dose of blue mass or fill our 
system with calomel. A late issue of "What to 
Kat" says that if people understood the medici- 
nal values of the foods they would use them more 
for physical ills and the doctors would have to ^o 
to something" else for a living. Por instance, spin- 
ach and dandelion are good for kidney trouble; 
celery is good for rheumatism, nervous diseases 
and dyspepsia; lettuce and cucumbers cool the 
system, and the former is good for insomnia. 

Asparagus — If you want to prespire freely, 
to relieve the system of impurities, try asparagus. 

Onion — There is nothing, medicinally speak- 
ing, so useful as the poor and humble onion. 
They are almost the best nervine known and 
may be used in coughs, colds and grippe, in con- 
sumption, scurvy and kindred diseases. White 
onions overcome sleeplessness, while red ones are 
an excellent diuretic. -Katen every day they soon 
have a whitening effect on the complexion. 

Cranberries — For malaria and erysipelas 
nothing is better than cranberries. 

Carrots, etc. — Presh carrots and yellow 
turnips are good for scurvy. Carrots for asthma, 
watermelon for epilepsy and yellow fever, lem- 
ons for feverish thirst in biliousness, low fevers, 
rheumatism, coughs colds and liver complaints. 

Kggs — Eggs beaten up raw with sugar are 
used to clear and strengthen the voice, while 
with lemon and sugar the beaten white of an egg 
may be used to relieve hoarseness. 

Exchange.

Popped Corn — A diet of popped corn and 
fruit is said to be a panacea for many bodily ills. 

Rice — It is claimed that a diet of rice for one 
month will cure Bright's disease. 

Jl Valuable treatise necessarily^ Omitted, 



We have a short treatise on ' 'The Nutrative 
Values of Fruits and Nuts," kindly prepared for 
this department by Prof. Joffa, Assistant Pro- 
fessor of Agriculture, Univ^ersity of California, 
but which we are obliged to omit for lack of 
space. About the time it was received we were 
notified by our publishers that the copy on hand 
already exceeded the contract number of pages for 
Cook Book. We still had several departments 
to provide for, which must be condensed into the 
smallest possible space, and as the department 
of "Meals Without Meat" came last the cut fell 
heaviest upon it, much to the regret of the com- 
mittee. We have found space, however, for a few 
extracts from this valuable paper: "In the Veg- 
etable Kingdom there are foods rich in the differ- 
ent ingredients requisite for the proper nourish- 
ment of the body, among the.se are fruits and 
nuts." In the nine dietary studies, and thirty-one 
digestive experiments carried on at the Universi- 
t3% fruit and nuts constituted all or almost all the 
diet. "The result of these investigations. " says 
Prof. Joffa, "emphasize the fact that both fruit 
and nuts should be considered as TRUE FOODS, 
rather than food ascessories, a fact commonly 
overlooked." Por full information regarding 
these Dietary Studies Prof. Joffa refers us to U. 
S. Dept. Agr., Office Ex. Stas. Buls. 21-29-31-35-

MEALS WITHOUT MEAT 382 

Uncocked Toed, 



By permission, the following is taken from 
"Solution of the Kitchen Problem, " published 
by K. W. Conable, the great exponent of un- 
cooked food. "The second step in the race up- 
ward, and in the line of physical and mental un- 
foldment, is found in what is known as the Un- 
cooked Food Diet — a diet composed entirely of 
uncooked foods, consisting of nuts, fruits, cereals 
and vegetables that are suitable for consumption 
without being cooked, milk, butter, vegetable 
oils, etc." 

FORMULAS. 

The following formulas are given for each of 
the seven days in the week, and they contemplate 
only two meals each day. Those who prefer to 
add or continue the morning meal (this one being 
omitted in giving these formulas) can do so. 
With the large amount of general information 
here given, it will not be difficult to prepare any 
number of meals.

'■Th^re is no excuse for invalidism, 
Go into training, breath deeply, eat little and well, tliink right and be well. 

"It is a disgrace in this enlightened age to be siclily and delicate." 

Ella Wheeler Wilcox. 



Learn the art of caring- for the hoUvSe you live 
in, not only the house that is built by hands, and 
shared with family and friends, but your soul 
house that is builded by thought. Think of the 
food you eat, not only as something that tastes 
good; not as something merely to gratify the ap- 
petite, but as something to build the body and 
keep it in repair. To keep these bodies in the 
best possible trim one must not only eat right, 
but breathe right, sleep right, and most impor- 
tant of all, THINK right and take systematic ex- 
ercivse. Dr. Peebles says: "All individuals are 
to a certain extent artists, painting their habits, 
thoughts and general conduct on their faces. 
Jealousy, envy, selfishness, dissatisfaction, an 
irritable disposition all print crows' feet inden- 
tations in the corners of the eyes, darken the 
vshadows, deepen the wrinkles, draw down the 
corners of the mouth and sharpen the features. 
Candor, integrity and cheerfulness exert the re- 
verse influences. Don't indulge in or listen to 
neighborhood gossip. If you have ill feelings 
toward a neighbor do them a kindness. The 
exercise of love and good will conduce to health 
and make earth a heaven now and here.'" 

BRKATHING, BATHING AND KXERCISK. 

Regular cold baths each morning, in pure wa- 
ter right from the well or hydrant — or spring is 



MEALS WITHOUT MEAT 388 

better if you have one — with at least two hot 
baths at iiig-ht each week just before retiring- for 
cleansing purposes (always using vegetable oil 
soap), are necessary to health and strength and 
happiness. It is impossible to radiate Sunshine 
when the pores of the bod}' are clogged up with 
deca3'ing matter, struggling- to find an outlet in 
advance of the Sunshine. And deep breathing- 
is also always necessary as a nerve stimulant 
and tonic for every portion of the body. That 
we may experience the full benefits of proper 
breathing we should always sleep in a room with 
the windows wide open and where there is per- 
fect ventilation, always using- as little clothing 
as possible and that of a light nature. Light 
exercise — never violent — should find favor with 
everyone. They are necessar}' to a healthful, 
vigorous body and mentality. The great bulk of 
all exercise should consist of tensing and relax- 
ing the muscles. The point is to tense all the 
muscles of the various portions of the body to 
the fullest extent of the physical ability for a few 
seconds and then allow them to relax until they 
give the sensation of being perfectly limp- But 
first, before tensing, you must take in a deep 
breath and hold it until 3^ou get ready to relax, 
then exhale slowly. You also carry the thoughts 
to the center of the muscles being tensed. But of 
course one cannot tense ALL the muscles of the 
body at one and the same time. Take the legs, 
for instance, first. Stand erect and tense all the 
muscles in the ankles, the calves, the knees and 
thighs. Keep them tensed for a few seconds 
and then relax. Repeat this for a half dozen 
times. Now stand erect with the head high up 
and well back and tense all the muscles of the 
waist, the chest and the back. Repeat six times, 



389 MEALS WITHOUT MEAT 

relaxing fully after each tensing motion. Now 
throw the head clear back and tense all the mus- 
cles of the neck. Beautifully shaped necks can 
be produced by this exercise. Now stretch the 
arms out, close the hands tightly and tense the 
muscles of the hands, the fingers, the wrists and 
the forearms. Repeat six times. Now hold the 
arms out straight, bending them at the elbows 
until the lower arms are perpendicular, hands 
open— tense all the muscles of the shoulders and 
biceps, gradually bringing the hands over until 
the fingers touch the shoulders. You also tense 
the muscles of the chest in this exercise. Repeat 
six times. Just before retiring is a good time to 
take these exercises. 

"Solution of Kitchen Problems." 

WATER. 

Water is one of the three life essentials, food and 
air being the other two, so it holds to reason that 
an intelligent use of water would promote health 
and longevity. Dr. Paul Kdwards, than whom 
we have no higher authority in the care of the 
body, says: "How shall we drink? Well, here 
is my rule: 'On arising each morning, I drink 
about two glasses of cold or hot water, which 
ever I desire, then at about ten o'clock I take 
two glasses more. Somewhere about three p. 
m. I take two more glasses, then on retiring at 
night, which is usually between nine and ten 
o'clock, I take as much more. The whole two 
glasses need not be taken at one draught but I 
manage to drink about two glasses near these 
hours. ' Water taken at these hours finds the 
stomach empty, and does not retard digestion. If 
one's stomach is flooded with water when food is 



MEALS WITHOUT MEAT 3<>0 

present nature partly or wholly suspends diges- 
tion until the water is absorbed by the stomach 
walls. This delay in digestion causes gas to 
form, the food will often vsour during its reten- 
tion in the stomach, and and we have an acid 
stomach which leads to facial neuralgia in many 
cases, and to other bodil}^ disturbances. Nearly 
every person who neglects to drink water in suf- 
ficient quantity is constipated, has a withered 
skin, poor memory, shortage of blood (anaemia) 
and a host of other troubles. Remember that 
water is one of the three life essentials and must 
be intelligently considered. Drink water as far 
from meals as possible, and never drink iced 
water.
