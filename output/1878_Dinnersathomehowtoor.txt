PREFACE. 



A POPULAR idea exists that only those who can 
afford to give high salaries to their cooks can 
expect good dinners served at their own tables, 
and, as' a consequence, many gentlemen are 
driven to dine at their Clubs rather than incur 
the risk of having both their temper and 
digestion spoiled by the incompetency of their 
cooks. 

It must be acknowledged that at the present 
day most ladies of moderate incomes do not pay 
sufficient attention to their CUISINE. A mis- 
tress of a house should know how to order a 
dinner, how the various dishes are dressed, 
so as to be able to explain them to her cook, 
and she should see that there is a sufficiency of 



PREFACE. 



every necessary ingredient, without which it is 
impossible for a cook to do justice to her menu. 
" Dinners at Home " is specially designed to 
give the Mistress of the Household such infor- 
mation as will enable her, without her constant 
attendance in the kitchen, (as is erroneously 
supposed essential by many), with a cook of 
moderate pretensions, to have a THOROUGHLY 
SATISFACTORY DINNER SERVED AT HOME. 

The order in which the receipts are placed 
will, it is hoped, be a considerable help, both to 
the mistress and servant The cook who will 
profit by them is not the professed artiste — nor 
on the other hand, one who knows nothing of 
the elements of cookery. I suppose her to be 
active — with taste for her work, and desirous of 
improving herself. If she be willing to follow 
these receipts exactly as they are written I 
will undertake to say that, in a short time, she 
will have added considerably to her knowledge, 
and be a " wiser and a better " cook.

HINTS FOR THE MISTRESS 
OF THE HOUSE. 

Be very careful about having the meat well 
kept, according to the season of the year. Either 
order or choose it yourself at the butcher's. You 
cannot expect, if the cook have to go out mar- 
keting every morning, that she can prepare the 
servants' dinner and the lunch as they ought to 
be done, and send up the late dinner properly 
dressed. Let everything be at her hand. 

Lay out in your mind a bill of fare for each 
day in the week, and order the meat required 
accordingly. 

Keep your own stores, and give out what is 
wanted for each day. 

Write your orders for the cook daily, with 
separate orders for the greengrocer, fishmonger, 
&c, as they call. Your presence in the kitchen 
should not now be required till next morning. 



to SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

A visit once a-week to the butcher's is quite 
sufficient, as a general rule. One special object 
of this little work is to guard against large joints, 
which are in reality more extravagant than the 
smaller and more tempting made-dishes. 

It is a mistake to have these " for company " 
only ; for then the cook, accustomed to serve up 
nothing but joints, gets confused, and lamentable 
results follow ; whereas, if she have daily train- 
ing in small dishes, as a matter of course all 
goes well when a few friends join the home 
circle. 

It is a good plan to have one made dish every 
day in the family dinner, and to practise it till 
perfect — then begin with another, and so on 
till you have a list of tested dishes, which you 
can always vary to the size and pretensions of 
your party. 

Get the butcher to give you five or six 
pieces of neck of mutton every week, such as 
he calls the "fair end" for cutlets. Always 
have them ready for an emergency. 

Loin chops are considered best; but for cutlets 
I prefer the part I have mentioned. The scrag 
attached to the neck is good for mutton broth, 
but unless you want it for that purpose, it is 



HINTS FOR THE MISTRESS. 1 1 

better to pay a little more per pound for the neck 
without it. 

I do not approve, as some do, of dividing a 
leg of mutton. If you wish to make more than 
one dish out of it, I prefer half boiling it, then 
cut off as many steaks as you require, dust 
them with pepper and salt, broil over a clear 
fire, and serve very hot with gravy. The re 
mainder of the leg can be made into a hash of 
mince, curry, or rissoles, and will be all the 
better for the meat having been half-cooked. 

To be succulent and tender the steaks must 
be cut off the leg while hot, otherwise they will 
be hard and unpalatable. 

As to a fillet of beef, some butchers will cut 
it for you out of the sirloin, and charge you in 
proportion ; but where this is not the case the 
only way to use the sirloin after the fillet is 
cut out is to stew it, for if roasted it will be found 
to be dry and hard. A very nice small round 
of beef is procured by buying from twelve to 
fourteen pounds of ribs of beef. The butcher 
will take out the bones (a valuable addition to 
the stock pot), and roll it. If too large it can 
be cut in two, and it will give you two good 
roasts (a skewer must be run through to keep 



12 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

it in shape). One can be put into pickle and 
makes an excellent miniature round of beef. 

Never allow inferior butter to be used in 
cooking. I have known many a dish upon 
which the cook had probably spent much time 
and trouble utterly spoiled by rancid butter. 

In addition to the articles generally found in 
every kitchen, the following are also necessary 
or the receipts given in this book : — 

The American whisk. 

Sausage machine (for rissoles, sandwiches, &c). 

Digester (for making soup to hold ten quarts). 

One dozen Timbale cases (for little puddings, 
Timbales of maccaroni, &c). 

Two souffle dishes (for fondus, souffles, &c). 

Scoop (for cutting out the core of apples). 

A Flat tin baking dish. 

A tin saucepan, into which fits a china sauce- 
pan, on the principle of the French Bain- 
marie, water being put in the outer sauce- 
pan, by which means the dish is steamed 
instead of boiled. 

Two medium-sized copper saucepans, with lids 
to hold fire. 



HINTS FOR THE COOK. 

WELL wipe the meat every day, pepper it, and 
be very careful to cut out the kernel in the fat, 
which extends to the meat and gives it a taint. 
By not paying proper attention to this the meat 
has often an unpleasant taste. 

Be sure the saucepans are always well cleaned 
before they are put away, and try and keep one 
for the use of each dish you are in the habit of 
cooking. 

Weigh out every ingredient in each receipt, 
— some cooks will not do this, but trusting to 
the rule of thumb, utterly fail. 

Dripping is far better for frying fish than 
either lard or butter, and a careful cook will 
always have plenty at hand. The following is 
an excellent way of clarifying dripping. Put it 
into a basin, pour over it some boiling water, 
and stir it round with a silver spoon ; set it to 



1 4 SHOR rS DINNERS A T HOME. 

cool, and then remove the dripping from the 
sediment, and put it into jars. Keep in a cool 
place. 

The cook ought to know how to santer. 
This means to dress anything quickly in a 
small pan with a very little butter, oil, or lard — 
whereas frying means boiling in hot fat. 

GRAVY. 

Never be in the house without stock or gravy. 
If you have to buy meat for it, get neck of beef, 
cut in dice, and fried a nice brown. One quart 
of water to each pound of beef, boiled down to 
half. Peppercorns, a little thyme and parsley 
added. Let the gravy boil slowly until rich 
enough, then strain, and when cool remove the 
fat. Let it boil up, season if necessary, and 
thicken with a teaspoonful of corn-flour, mixed 
smooth in cold water, to about half a pint of 
gravy. 

ROAST MEAT OR FOWL. 

The old-fashioned roaster is supposed to be 
the best for roasting meat, but as the close 
range is now almost always used instead of the 



HINTS FOR THE COOK. 15 

open one, the following directions will be found 
useful : — 

Grease the pan with fat before the meat is put 
into the oven. Then pour over the meat 2 or 3 
tablespoonsful of water, and while roasting keep 
turning and basting continually ; and you will 
find when it is done you will have a quantity of 
rich gravy, which strain through a strainer, and 
serve with the meat in a sauce boat. The great 
secret is to have the oven hot, and never to 
close the door completely. There must be free 
ventilation, or the condensed heat will cause 
the meat to have an unpleasant flavour. 



COOKING CHOPS AND STEAKS. 

They should be cooked over a clear red fire, 
on which the gridiron should be placed two 
minutes before the meat is laid on it. 



LARDING. 

Every cook ought to know how to lard. 
Poultry and white game are much improved 
by it, and several entrees have to be larded ; 
and by following the excellent receipt of Soyer, 



1 6 SHORTS DINNERS A T HOME. 

it ought to be done easily : — " Lay your meat 
lengthwise, upon a clean napkin, across your 
hand, forming a kind of bridge with your 
thumb at the part you are about to commence 
at, then with the point of the larding needle 
make 3 distinct lines across, J inch apart, run 
the needle into the 3rd line at the further side 
of the meat, and bringing it out at the first, 
placing one of the larded pieces in it (these 
ought to be about 2 inches in length, and 
rather more than Jth of an inch in width), 
draw the needle through, leaving out \ inch of 
the bacon at each line ; proceed thus to the 
end of the row, then make another line half-an- 
inch distant, stick in another row of larded 
pieces, bringing them out at the second line, 
leaving the ends of the bacon out all the same 
length, make the next row again at the same 
distance, bringing the ends out between the 
larded pieces of the first row, proceeding in this 
manner until the whole surface is larded in 
chequered rows." 

When larding poultry, dip for one moment 
into boiling water in order to make the flesh 
firm. 



HINTS FOR THE COOK. i 7 

TO PREPARE BACON FOR LARDING. 

It is much better to prepare your own bacon 
for larding, as what is bought is often rancid and 
unwholesome. 

Get a piece of bacon the thickness of two 
fingers, and weighing from 3 to 5 lbs. (thin 
bacon is the best), put it into an earthen dish, 
spread some ground salt at the bottom and 
over the bacon. Add a glass of cold water ; 
and turn the bacon from time to time in 
the pickle. A fortnight afterwards hang it — 
sprinkling it over with a little fine salt. The 
same pickle will do once again, but not oftener. 

ICING JELLIES AND CREAMS. 

If you have two or three moulds to ice, get a 
stone of rough ice, put it into a pail, and sprinkle 
over a handful of pickling salt, then bury your 
moulds in it, and leave in the air or a cool 
place ; the ice must come up to within a quarter 
of an inch of the top of the mould. 

They must remain in all day, and the great 
secret of icing is to turn round the moulds 
three or four times in the day, so that each part 
may be equally iced.

SOUPS (POTAGES). 



SOUPS. 

The great mistake of English cooks in making 
soups is the quantity of meat they use, and also 
omitting to add to the stock a good amount 
of vegetables, such as turnips, carrots, leeks, 
onioias, &c. Where much meat is used in 
the house, good white stock ought to be made 
with the bones and trimmings of the meat used 
for made dishes. A frequent fault is to put too 
much salt and pepper in the soup. Let this be 
avoided. 

Stock must always be perfectly cold before 
putting it away, and kept covered. 

It can be kept in winter for two or three 
days, but in summer it will be necessary to boil 
it every day. 

The meat for soup must always be cut into 
dice and put into a well buttered soup pot. At 



3o SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

first pour over only a small quantity of the 
water and boil up, -stirring round with a spoon 
for about ten minutes until it forms a thick 
gravy at the bottom, when add the remainder 
of the water. 

The time for boiling soup depends upon the 
quality of the meat. As soon as all the juice 
of the meat is extracted, the soup is ready, and 
would only be spoilt if the meat were left in 
longer. The vegetables are not to be added 
till the stock has been down some little time, 
and skimmed, and should only be left in till 
they are done. 

BROWN STOCK. 

Chop up fine 10 lbs. of beef from the middle 
of the hock, and also the bones. Add I head 
of celery, 2 carrots, I leek, I onion, and 2 shalots, 
and some sweet herbs. To every pound of beef 
add 2 breakfast cups of water. Let it boil gently 
for several hours; never let it get to a bubble, or 
the soup will be white. Skim as soon as it comes 
to a boil, and then strain. The better it is 
skimmed the clearer it will be. Vermicelli, rice, 
tapioca, or macaroni may be added, but must 
never be boiled with the meat or vegetables. 



SOUPS. 31 



ANOTHER BROWN STOCK. 

If you happen to be out of your stock and 
want to make soup for the same day, take 3 lbs. 
of good beef (not soup meat), free from fat and 
gristle, and cut into small dice. Put into the 
soup pot with 2 or 3 chicken necks, a head of 
celery, and a small pinch of salt. Pour over 
this 2 quarts of boiling water, and boil gently 
all day, never letting it get to a bubble. Before 
straining add a cup of cold water, then pass 
through a hair sieve, or a bit of canvas used for 
straining milk. 

N.B. — The lid of the saucepan must be 
always closely covered. Add tapioca, vermicelli, 
or any thickening you like, prepared according 
to the receipts given. 

WHITE STOCK. 

Chop up all the bones that you have (cooked 
and not cooked) very small ; if there is meat 
on the cooked bones so much the better. To 
every pound of bones add a breakfast cup of 
cold water, carrots, turnips, and all sorts of herbs. 
Boil gently all day, then strain. This is a cheap 
and excellent stock for all kinds of white soup, 
such as barley, pea soup, mutton broth, &c. 



32 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

GOOD WHITE STOCK. 

Cut up 4 lbs. of knuckle of veal, and put it 
with the bones and trimmings of poultry, 4 
slices of lean ham, into a stewpan which has 
been rubbed with one ounce of butter. Moisten 
with half a pint of water, and simmer till the 
gravy begins to flow. Then add 4 quarts of 
water, 3 carrots, 2 onions, 1 head of celery, 12 
white peppercorns, 2 oz. salt, a blade of mace 
and a bunch of herbs. Simmer for five hours. 
Skim and strain carefully through a very fine 
hair sieve. 

N.B. — To make this stronger you can double 
the quantity of veal, or put in a fowl. A good 
addition to all white stock is the liquor in which 
a turkey has been boiled. 

TO CLEAR SOUP. 

If by some accident the soup is not quite 
clear use the whites of eggs. For 2 quarts of 
stock take the whites of 2 eggs carefully 
separated from their yolks, whisk them together 
with a half-pint of water, add them gradually to 
the stock, (which must be just warmed) con- 
tinuing to whisk them. Place the soup on the 



SOUPS. 33 



fire, and when boiling and well-skimmed, stir 
well, draw it to the side of the fire, and let it 
settle until the whites of the eggs become 
separated. Pass through a fine cloth, when the 
soup will be clear. All clear soups should be 
of a light colour, and not taste too strongly of 
the meat. 

N.B. — Soup should never be made of hard 
water. 

POT AU FEU. 

See that the fire is carefully made up, and if 
well made at first, it will not require remaking 
during the process. It ought to be kept at a 
gentle regular heat. Take ij lb. of beef, bone 
it, and tie it up with string ; take 3 oz. of bones, 
place them at the bottom of the digester, and 
the meat on them ; add 3 h quarts of water 
and I oz. of salt, and boil. In putting on the 
cover of the soup-pot, be careful to leave an 
opening about the width of an inch. As soon 
as the scum rises, add a quarter pint of cold 
water, and skim. 

Let the broth boil up three times, and skim 
three times. After this, it ought to be perfectly 
clear. Wipe the edges carefully, and add the 



34 SHORTS DINNERS A T HOME. 

vegetables ; this will stop the boiling. As soon 
as the broth boils up again, draw the soup-pot 
aside so that a third of it is only over the fire. 
Place cinders on the fire to subdue the heat, 
and keep a regular gentle fire for three hours. 
Then take out the meat and remove all the fat, 
which can also be done while gently boiling. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. 

Scald 2 oz. for five minutes in if pint of 
water, in which put a teaspoonful of salt. Let 
it cool, and then pass through a cullender to 
drain. Pour it into if pint of boiling stock; 
stir with a skimmer to prevent the vermicelli 
getting into lumps. Let it simmer for five 
minutes on the corner of the range, covering 
three-quarters of the saucepan. Skim the froth 
which rises to the surface. The above propor- 
tions will give soup for four people. All pastes, 
such as macaroni or Italian paste, are served in 
the same manner. 

TAPIOCA SOUP. 

Into one quart of boiling soup drop gently 
with one hand ij oz. of tapioca, stirring well 



SOUPS. 35 



with a spoon to prevent lumps forming. Then 
place the saucepan on the corner of the range, 
and let it simmer for twenty minutes, taking 
care to keep on the lid of the saucepan to pre- 
vent a scum forming on the surface ; skim and 
serve. The above proportions are for soup for 
four people. 

N.B. — The French tapioca prepared by Groult 
is the best. 

RICE SOUP. 

Wash a good ounce of Carolina rice in three 
waters; scald in if pint of water, stirring it 
carefully. Let it get cool, and drain it. Four 
into one quart of boiling soup, stirring it to mix 
well. Leave the saucepan three-quarters covered 
for twenty-five minutes at the corner of the 
range to give the rice time to swell. Skim and 
serve. The above proportions are for soup for 
four people. 

CONSOMME. 

Take 2\ lbs. knuckle of veal, 2\ lbs. shin of 
beef, 5 lbs. lean beef (cut from the middle of

and put them in the soup pot which must be

will make 4 quarts of soup). Simmer over a 
slow fire for several hours, then add 2 carrots, 
celery, 2 cloves, thyme, laurel leaf, and salt, and 
when these are done, pass the soup through a 
tammy, and skim. 

N.B. — A second stock can be made by pour- 
ing fresh water on the ingredients, add salt, and 
boil for two hours. 

CONSOMME OF CHICKEN.

per lb.), J lb. will be sufficient for soup for 12 
people. Soak it for three days in cold water, 
changing the water twice a-day, then take 5 
quarts of consomme and let the turtle simmer 
gently in it. When quite soft take out the 
turtle and again clear the soup, then cut it

fire, stirring gently. As soon as it begins to 
boil add carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, and 
celery, all chopped up. Boil twenty minutes —

SOUP a la Francaise. 

(This is a most useful receipt for daily use.) 
Take 3 lbs. of lean beef, put in a saucepan 
holding 5 quarts of water. When it comes 
to a boil take it off the fire and remove the 
scum, then fill the pot with every kind of soup

parsnips. Stew quietly all day ; at night strain 
into an earthen pan. In the morning remove 
the fat and clear it with the whites of two 
eggs, not stirring it while boiling. It ought 
only to boil for about two minutes, then draw 
it from the fire and let it stand at the corner of

done, throw them into the soup and give them 
one boil. 

SOUP a la BONNE FEMME. 

Shred 12 green leaves of a lettuce very fine. 
Fry them in a little butter, keeping them well 
stirred for ten minutes. Add a quart of good 
stock and boil for half an hour. Then mix in 
the yolks of 6 eggs, half a pint of cream, a very 
little pounded sugar and salt. Stir quickly, and 
only just let it thicken without boiling, or it will 
curdle, which would spoil the soup. 

SOUP AND BOUILLI. 

Put in the digester a shin of beef cut into 
pieces, the bones and remains of meat, necks 
of chickens, &c. Add y or 8 pints of water, 
when it has begun to boil, 2 or 3 carrots, 1 
head of celery, 3 leeks, an onion stuck with

3 lbs. of beef in the same pot, and in 3 hours 
it will be ready to serve, with vegetables sepa- 
rately boiled. The soup may be skimmed and 
strained (vermicelli added according to the 
receipt already given, if desired).

for this soup, as young vegetables are required. 

Cut into all sorts of shapes young carrots, 
turnips, small onions, asparagus tops, cauli- 
flowers divided into little bunches, green peas, 
and French beans, each to be separately scalded 
with a little salt and boiling water, and then

consomme, throw in a head of celery, first 
cook the turnips and carrots, then the onions; 
when they are done add the other vegetables 
(which have been already more than three- 
quarters done in the scalding), and take care 
not to let them break. The peas and beans 
ought to be very green, and the soup very 
clear and rich. Add the smallest quantity of 
white sugar.

FRENCH VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Take 5 small carrots, 3 turnips, 3 small 
leeks, cut them into small pieces, add one 
pint of peas, put all into 4 quarts of boiling 
water, and let them boil over a slow fire for 
three and a-half hours, then add 2 ozs. of 
butter, and strain through a sieve, after which 
boil again for five or six minutes. Put two 
yolks of eggs into the tureen and add gradually 
the boiling soup, with a little cream. 

SWISS SOUP. 

For six persons take about a common dish- 
ful of spinach. Add a handful of chervil, then 
pound 2 cabbage stalks, slice 3 or 4 onions, 
stalks, and marjoram. Mince them together 
very fine, and press out the juice till the vege- 
tables are quite dry. Heat some butter in 
a pan, and let the vegetables steep in it until 
soft, but not too long, or else they will get 
watery. When thoroughly steeped, stir in a 
cupful of flour, and pour over it as much water 
(or broth) as will make the necessary quantity 
of soup. Add a little salt, and boil a good 
quarter of an hour. Before serving, put in the 



42 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

tureen the yolks of 2 eggs beaten up with a 
spoonful of cream, and add the boiling soup. 

COLBERT SOUP. 

Take some good consomme, and serve in it 
poached eggs, one for each person, prepared 
as follows : — Put a little water in the frying 
pan, add a pinch of salt, and half a wine 
glass of vinegar ; when the water boils break 
in the eggs, and cover the frying pan with 
a lid. In two minutes take off from the 
fire. If the white covers the yolk with a solid 
top the egg is done. Put into an earthen dish, 
not quite three pints of tepid water, raise each 
egg with the draining spoon, and put them in 
one by one, drain them, and trim neatly the 
outer surface of the white, to give them an 
oval shape. Put them into the soup tureen, 
and pour the boiling soup over. Great care 
is needed in poaching the eggs. 

CLEAR HARE SOUP. 

The fillets of the hare will make cutlets, but 
keep the body and the blood for soup (one hare 
will make three pints of soup), and put them 



SOUPS. 43 



into a stew-pan with three pints of cold water, 
peppercorns, and some onions which have been 
fried in the pan with some thyme. Boil all day. 
Skim well. Strain through a hair sieve, and let 
it stand till next day, when clear it with egg 
shells and onion peels. Before serving add a 
little port wine. It ought to be as clear as 
sherry. 

RABBIT SOUP. 

Cut up the rabbit small. Colour some butter. 
Take 6 onions and brown the meat in them, 
stirring carefully. Then add a heaped spoonful 
of flour, some stock or water, a little chopped 
parsley, salt, and 2 laurel leaves. When the 
meat is tender, pour the broth through a sieve, 
heat it again on the fire and boil as much sago 
in it as will thicken it. 

BEEF TEA. 

Take 2 lbs. good juicy lean beef. Free it 
entirely from every bit of skin and fat, chop it 
up very fine, and put into an earthen jar with a 
cover. The jar must be just the size to hold 
the whole quantity loosely, and without being 
pressed down. Add as much cold water as the 



44 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

jar will hold, which will be about a pint and a 
half, and sprinkle a little salt on it. Put the 
jar into an oven, where it must remain from 
eight to twelve hours, (the oven being of a 
moderate heat the whole time,) until every drop 
of juice is extracted from the meat. When done 
strain, and let it stand till cold. Heat as re- 
quired in the bainmarie. 

CLEAR OX-TAIL SOUP. 

Stew down three ox-tails in plain gravy, add 
three quarts good well-flavoured beef stock. 
Clear the soup, and flavour with cayenne pepper 
and port wine. Cut the tails into pieces and 
stew them ten minutes in the soup before 
serving. 

THICK OX-TAIL SOUP. 

Take 2 ox-tails, cut them in pieces, and put 
in a saucepan with 2 quarts of water, and let 
simmer till well done. Then mix together J lb. 
of butter, sufficient flour to thicken ; 2 sliced 
onions (previously fried in butter), and a bunch 
of herbs tied in a piece of muslin. Boil all to- 
gether half an hour, then strain through a fine 
sieve. 



SOUPS. 45 

Cut some carrots and turnips into shapes, 
cook them separately, and when the soup is 
ready to be served, throw in the vegetables and 
mix all together. Make up the quantity of 
soup required by the addition of good stock. 
This soup is better made the day before it is 
wanted, as when cold the fat can be removed 
before adding the other ingredients. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

To every pound of scrag of mutton put two 
breakfast cups of water ; add pearl barley, 
carrots, turnips, thyme, and onions, and boil for 
five or six hours. When it comes to a boil, 
skim, and continue this, as the grease rises. 
Add a little parsley just before serving. 

PEA SOUP. 

To every quart of white stock add one large 
tablespoonful of Symington's pea flour; blend 
it smoothly and let it boil for about ten minutes, 
stirring all the time. Serve very hot, with 
squares of fried bread on a separate plate.

6 oz. fresh butter for a few minutes. Then 
pour over a quart of white stock, and boil 
slowly for three or four hours. Pass through a 
hair sieve, add the yolk of an egg and some 
cream, and serve. The addition of thick cream 
and the yolks of two eggs will make this soup 
Creme d' Orge. 

POTAGE k la Reine. 

Roast a fowl, skin it, pound the flesh, and 
pass through a tammy. Break the bones and 
boil them with some rice till it is tender, then 
pass it also through a tammy, mix it with the 
chicken, and put down both into some stock 
(white if possible), and when done add some 
cream, and serve with sippets fried in butter. 
The soup ought to be as smooth as cream. 

FRENCH ONION SOUP. 

Take rather better than f lb. onions, peel 
them, and cut them crossways in very thin slices, 
all the same size and thickness, so that they 
may be equally cooked. Parboil them for ten 



SOUPS. 47 



minutes in boiling water, and drain. Put I oz. 
butter into a saucepan, and let the onions 
colour over a quick fire. When they have got 
a light colour add I oz. flour, leave it for two 
minutes on the fire. Add if pint of water, 
two pinches of salt, and the same of pepper — 
stir on the fire till the first boiling, leave it for 
five minutes by the side of the fire. Put in the 
tureen 2 oz. bread, and I oz. of butter, stir 
lightly with a spoon to melt the butter, and 
serve. 

CRESSY SOUP (Maigre).

FISH— (With Sauces.) 

BOILED SOLES. 

Soles for boiling must be large. Well wash 
and clean them, remove the fins, and put the 
soles into a fish kettle with salt and water. Let 
them boil slowly and simmer until done, when 
serve on a napkin with the white side upper- 
most, with melted butter or shrimp sauce. 

MELTED BUTTER. 

Have your saucepan very clean ; put into it 
2y 2 oz. fresh butter, with two tablespoonsful of 
water, and shake it over a clear fire one way 
until it boils ; make it quite hot, but be careful 
not to colour it ; well whisk the yolks of two 
eggs, pour them to the butter, beating them 
all the while. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, 
and if you like, a few capers. 



54 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

RICHER MELTED BUTTER. 

Take about half-a-pound of butter, put it 
with salt and pepper and two tablespoonsful 
of lemon-juice into a saucepan, which place on 
the fire, stir with a wooden spoon, and when 
melted to half its quantity take it off the fire, 
and continue stirring till it is entirely dissolved. 
By not melting the whole of it on the fire the 
sauce will be more creamy, and a fresher taste 
than if it had been the whole time on the fire. 

SAUCE IMPERATRICE. 

Mix some flour with a little water (in the 
proportion of one tablespoonful for every two 
persons), adding salt, pepper, and a little 
vinegar. Put on the fire till the flour is well 
mixed, then add butter (allow for each person 
I oz.) in tiny pieces, beating well all the time, 
and take care that each piece is well incor- 
porated before you put in the next. Keep the 
sauce near the fire. It must never be allowed 
to boil. The greater the quantity of butter the 
better and richer the sauce will be. For all 
kinds of boiled fish this is an excellent sauce. 



FISH. 55 

PARSLEY SAUCE 

Is made like butter sauce ; the parsley to be 
chopped and thrown into the boiling water just 
before mixing with the flour. 

SHRIMP SAUCE. 

Mix a teaspoonful of -essence of anchovies 
and a pinch of cayenne with half-a-pint of 
melted butter ; add a pint of picked shrimps 
to the melted butter when boiling ; then set it 
on one side of the fire till the shrimps are heated 
through, but do not let it boil again. Add a 
very little piece of lemon. 

FRENCH METHOD OF SERVING FRIED FISH. 

Let the dripping be boiling hot — then put 
your fish in, and when done, serve on a hot 
dish in which is previously placed a small bit of 
butter, and scatter finely-chopped herbs over 
the fish. No butter sauce is required when the 
fish is done this way. 

N.B. — Be careful to dry and flour the fish 
before putting it into the dripping. Small 
soles, flounders, and large whiting are also done 
this way. 



56 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 



BOILED HADDOCK. 

Clean and wash thoroughly, then scrape, put 
in the fish kettle and simmer gently. You 
must put enough water to cover the fish. Put 
salt in the water — \ lb. to a gallon is a good 
proportion. Serve with oyster or anchovy 
sauce. If the fish be salted, serve with egg 
sauce. 

OYSTER SAUCE. 

Allow four oysters to each person. 

Open the oysters carefully, and save the liquor. 
Strain it into a clean lined saucepan, put in the 
oysters, and let them just come to the boiling 
point. Take them off the fire immediately, and 
put the whole into a basin. Strain the liquor 
and mix with it sufficient milk to make 
half a pint altogether. Take (to make the 
melted butter) I teaspoonful of flour and 2 oz. 
of butter, and mix them smoothly together on 
a plate ; put it into the lined saucepan, and 
pour in one-third of a pint of milk. Keep 
stirring it one way over a sharp fire, and let it 
boil quickly for a minute or two. 



FISH. 57 

When ready, and very smooth, put in the 
oysters (previously bearded). Set it by the side 
of the fire till heated through, but do not allow 
it to boil, or the oysters will get hard. Cream, 
instead of milk, makes this sauce delicious. 

EGG SAUCE. 

Make some good melted butter. Then take 
some eggs (the number must depend upon the 
quantity required), boil till hard, then soak 
them in cold water. When quite cold take off 
the shells and cut the eggs into large dice, 
laying them in a sauceboat, previously well 
heated. Pour the melted butter very hot over 
the eggs, and serve. 

RICH ANCHOVY SAUCE. 

This is a most excellent sauce when you do 
not want the expense of oyster or lobster sauce, 
and eats well with all boiled and fried fish. 

ANCHOVY SAUCE (less Rich). 
Stir three dessert-spoonsful of Burgess' es- 
sence of anchovy into half a pint of good melted 
butter. Season with a little cayenne, and boil 

it up for a minute or two. 
D 



58 SHORTS DINNERS A T HOME. 



Bone four Gorgona anchovies, pound them in 
a mortar to paste with I oz. of butter. Heat \ 
pint of good melted butter, stir in the pounded 
anchovies and a little cayenne. Simmer for 
three or four minutes, and add a squeeze of 
lemon juice. 

BRILL.

add a tablespoonful of vinegar. Thoroughly 
clean and remove the scales. Do not cut off the 
fins. Rub with the juice of lemon and a little 
salt. Set in a fish kettle, covering it with the 
salt and water and vinegar.

or twenty minutes, according to size. 

Skim well. Serve with Dutch sauce. 

DUTCH SAUCE. 

Put into a quart saucepan two tablespoons- 
ful of vinegar, seasoned with a little salt and 
white pepper ; reduce it on the fire till you have 
about a dessertspoonful of vinegar. Take it 
from the fire, adding two tablespoonsful of cold 
water, and the yolks of two eggs, taking care 



FISH. 59 

not to leave any white. Put again on a gentle 
fire, stirring with a wooden spoon. As soon as 
the yolks begin to set, take from the fire. 
Divide \ lb. of butter into five heaps. Now 
add one heap to the eggs, and stir with the 
spoon till melted, then put on the fire for a 
minute, adding the second heap. Do this till 
all the heaps of butter are melted, but be care- 
ful that one heap is dissolved before the other 
is added. After having mixed the third heap, 
pour into the saucepan a tablespoonful of cold 
water, to prevent the sauce from curdling. 
When all the butter is used, add another table- 
spoonful of cold water, and even more should 
you find it necessary. 

TURBOT. 

First empty the fish, wash the inside, rubbing 
a little salt over it. Put into water to cleanse 
it, and change the water several times. Put 
plenty, of cold water into a fish kettle, adding 
to each gallon 4 oz. of salt, and a very small 
quantity of saltpetre. Let this dissolve. Make 
an incision in the skin of the back nearly to 
the bone, to prevent the white side from crack- 



60 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

ing. Do not cut off the fins. Place the turbot 
on the fish plate, and put it into the water, 
which should quite cover it. Boil slowly, 
and skim the water carefully. Simmer gently 
for about half an hour, and when done, lift 
up the fish plate and let it drain. 

Serve with lobster or any other of the sauces. 

LOBSTER SAUCE. 

Choose a middling sized hen lobster. Pick 
the meat from the shells, and cut into small 
square pieces. Put the spawn into a mortar 
with half an oz. of butter, and pound quite 
smooth. Rub through a hair sieve, and cover 
till wanted. 

Make the following melted butter : — 

Mix I tablespoonful of flour and J gill of 
water to a smooth batter, carefully rubbing 
down with the back of a spoon any lumps. Put 
into a saucepan with \ lb. of fresh butter, a little 
salt, and half a spoonful of white vinegar. Let 
it thicken on the fire. Simmer just one minute, 
but do not allow it to boil. 

Put into | pint of the above melted butter 
one tablespoonful of anchovy sauce and the 



FISH. 6 1 

butter (with the spawn). Salt and cayenne to 
taste, and 3 tablespoonsful of cream. Mix all 
well before you add the lobster, then put it in 
until thoroughly hot, but do not allow it to 
boil. 

BRILL OR TURBOT, heated up next day, 
(au Gratin.) 

Take the remains of fish left from the previous 
day, pick from the bones, and warm gently 
in salt and water. Then make separately the 
following sauce : — Mix very smoothly 2 table- 
spoonsful of flour with 1 quart of milk, a spoon- 
ful of salt, and not quite a saltspoonful of 
pepper. Stir over the fire till tolerably thick. 
Then lift to the side of the fire, stir in \ lb. of 
butter, and pass through a sieve. 

Cover the bottom of the dish with this sauce, 
lay on it some of the fish, sprinkling with white 
pepper and salt, then more sauce, then more 
fish, till all is used. Sprinkle bread crumbs 
over it, and bake in a hot oven for twenty 
minutes. Brown and serve in the same dish. 
A souffle tin is the best for this dish. Serve 
with a frill round.

fire until the whole has boiled for five minutes, 
then press through a pointed tin strainer into 
a small saucepan for use. 

FILLETS OF SOLES AND ANCHOVIES. 

Raise the fillets off a small sole. Take off 
the skins, and season with salt and pepper. Fry 
with a tablespoonful of olive oil, then put a 
weight over to flatten them. Clean 4 anchovies 
and wash out the salt. Cut each fillet into 
lengths of four. Pare the fillets of soles, and 
cut them into the same length as the anchovies. 
Range in a china dish alternately with the 
anchovies. 

Put into a small earthen pan four tablespoons- 
ful of oil and one of Tarragon vinegar, with

requires a great deal of butter. 

SKATE (Raie au Beurre Noir). 

Well wash the skate, divide the body from 
the two wings, cut it into small square pieces, 
and remove the thick glutinous skin. Put 
into the fish kettle with boiling water, to which

ENTREES. 

No matter how well the entrees are cooked, 
their appearance is spoilt if they are not 
nicely served up. Cutlets for instance (unless 
there are a sufficient number to keep them 
in a circle standing upright), are often difficult 
to arrange ; and mashed potatoes as a centre 
on which to rest them are often resorted to, 
This at once stamps the dish as common. 
I have found that a French roll (with the 
top cut off and scooped out so as to allow 
truffles, peas, &c, to be put inside), make a 
very pretty centre for cutlets, fillets of chicken, 
&c, each cutlet being trimmed with a frill of 
paper, and a sauce served round. For variety the 
hare cutlets, with currant jelly sauce, may have a 
boiled beetroot in the centre. This and the roll 
are of course only for effect, and not to be 
cut. For ten or twelve people there should 
always be duplicates of each entree. Remember 



76 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

that one entree ought to be white sauce and 
material, and the other brown ; and if there is 
a vol au vent of lobster, the second entree ought 
to be mutton cutlets with a brown sauce, and if 
the entree is mutton, the piece de resistance must 
be beef, and the savoury dish must not be of 
lobster, because the vol au vent is made of 
lobster. 

PLAIN MUTTON CUTLETS with Fried Potatoes. 

Trim twelve of equal thickness, dust them 
with salt. Put some clarified butter into a fry- 
ing pan, sautez the cutlets, cover them with a 
round of buttered paper, when done drain them, 
glaze and dress them in a circle on the dish, 
put the fried potatoes in the middle, and serve 
either with plain gravy, tomato, or Italian sauce 
(for the two latter without potatoes). 

To fry the potatoes proceed as follows : — 
Peel six potatoes, cut them on the breadth 
into narrow strips or into round balls. Put 
into the frying-pan about 2 lbs. of dripping, 
melt it over a quick fire, and throw in the 
potatoes. Stir from time to time with the 
skimmer, so that the potatoes are equally 



ENTREES. 77 



cooked ; from eight to ten minutes will be 
enough, then drain. 

SAUCE h, V Italienne. 

Put in a small stew-pan a dessert-spoonful of 
very finely chopped shalots, the same quantity 
of salad oil, a bay leaf, and thyme ; and stir 
this over the fire in order to fry the shalot with- 
out letting it colour. Then add a good table- 
spoonful of chopped mushrooms, a glass of 
sherry, a glass of mushroom catsup, a teaspoon- 
ful of essence of Anchovy, half a pint of stock, 
and one oz. of brown thickening. Stir over the 
fire until the sauce boils, and then allow the scum 
to rise by the side of the fire for ten minutes, 
then skim and pour into a stew-pan for use. 

MUTTON CUTLETS with Cucumbers. 

Chop some parsley and shalots very fine, and 
put them in a little melted butter, dip in the 
cutlets, and then in bread crumbs. Put them 
in the frying pan, and fry a fine light brown. 
Cut two cucumbers into four quarters, removing 
all the seeds ; cut them in oval shapes about 
one inch long ; boil them in half vinegar and 



78 SHORT'S DINNERS AT HOME. 

water till tender. Make a sauce with the 
trimmings of the cutlets, some minced shalots 
and herbs. Put the cucumbers into the sauce 
and make them very hot. Serve in the centre 
of the dish. 

MUTTON CUTLETS a la Maintenon. 

Take them from the neck or loin, about I J lb. 
and chop each bone short. Trim them neatly, 
and put them into a stewpan with a piece of 
butter and a little finely chopped thyme and 
parsley. Season with pepper and salt, fry 
lightly, and then take them out to cool, after 
which take some fresh chopped parsley and 
bread crumbs, spread them evenly over the 
cutlets with a knife, wrap each in buttered 
paper, and broil over a clear fire. Serve up in 
the papers with gravy in a tureen. 

MUTTON CUTLETS a la Reforme. 

Take some truffles, the red part of carrots 
boiled, some hard boiled whites of eggs, a little 
of the lean of ham and the same of tongue, and 
some green gherkins, and shred them into neat 
strippets half-an-inch long. Make them hot in 



ENTREES. 79 



a basin in the screen while you prepare the fol- 
lowing sauce: — Cut up into small dice some lean 
bacon, and an equal quantity each of carrots, 
celery and onion, and a little mace. Fry all in 
a small stewpan with a piece of butter the size 
of a walnut until the whole becomes well- 
browned, add a wineglassful of vinegar and half 
the quantity of catsup, and a teaspoonful of 
essence of anchovy. When this is reduced to 
half, add half a pint of brown sauce, and a glass 
of sherry. Let the sauce boil gently to throw 
up the grease, and strain through a sieve. 

Toss the chips lightly in this sauce, and pour 
all over nicely prepared cutlets. 

MUTTON CUTLETS k la Soubise— Excellent. 

Cut six chops about an inch thick off a neck 
of mutton, trim off most of the fat, put them into 
a frying pan with 2 ozs. of butter, cover up close 
in the oven for eight minutes, then turn them. 
Strain the butter off, and add a half-pint of clear 
gravy, and let them simmer gently for half-an- 
hour. When ready to dish up, glaze them, and 
pour the brown gravy round them, with soubise 
sauce in the centre. 



80 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 



WHITE SOUBISE SAUCE. 

Boil three good sized onions till quite tender, 
strain the water well from them, then pass 
through a tammy or hair sieve, add a quarter 
pint of cream and a lump of glaze about the 
size of a nutmeg, and thicken with a table- 
spoonful of flour. Boil for five minutes, stirring 
well or it will burn. 

MUTTON CUTLETS Pur^e aux Marrons 
(Chestnuts). 

Take a good handful of chestnuts, strip them 
of the brown skin, then put them into boiling 
water, when the second skin will come off. Put 
into a saucepan a little stock (veal is the best) 
to which add a piece of butter, a little sugar, 
and salt. Stew the chestnuts in this till quite 
tender, then put them into another saucepan. 
The puree ought to be pretty thick, but if you 
find it requires thinning, add a little more stock, 
then stir in a little more butter, which must be 
very fresh. This sauce is served like the soubise, 
round nicely broiled cutlets, or serve separately 
in a boat. 



ENTREES. § i 



HARICOT OF MUTTON. 
(French Receipt.) 

Take from 2 to 3 lbs. of chops, put them 
into a stewpan. Add butter, and two or 
three onions cut into thin slices, fry all to- 
gether till nicely browned. Make a roux with 
a little stock and flour, and add it to the meat. 
Cook the vegetables first by themselves, and 
then add to the other ingredients about half- 
an-hour before the meat is quite done. Cut 
into strips 2 carrots, 2 turnips and some celery ; 
when half done put them into the stewpan with 
the meat. Serve very hot. 

FILETS MIGNONS. 

(The Filet Mignon is the fillet that lies under 
the saddle, and often called in English the 
" Alderman's walk "). 

'Cut the fillet into 12 pieces, flatten them with 
a beater, removing the skin and the nerves. 
Trim them in the shape of a long pear. Lard 
and put them for 24 hours into a pickle of 
oil, onions, and a little parsley. When about to 
be cooked drain on a napkin. Butter a pan 



82 SHORTS DINNERS A T HOME. 

and put them in. Moisten with a little broth, 
without entirely covering them. When done, 
glaze and serve. 

Arrange them in a circle, with the roll centre, 
which fill with chopped mushrooms, and serve 
with a Poivrade or Piquante sauce. 

N.B. — The fillets may be served plainly 
broiled with pepper and salt. 

FILETS MIGNONS LARDED. 

Raise the fillets in length and shape them 
round, larding them at the top. Put some 
slices of bacon in a saucepan with some carrots, 
onions, 2 cloves, a bunch of parsley, some 
chives, thyme, and a laurel leaf. Place the 
fillets in this seasoning, then cover them with 
two sheets of buttered paper ; add a table- 
spoonful of stock. Put it on the fire at the end 
of an hour, put some fire on the lid to glaze the 
fillets. When ready to serve, drain, and serve 
with cucumber, chicory, or any dressing pre- 
ferred. 

THICKENING FOR SAUCES. 

Melt one pound of butter in a stew-pan 
upon a slow fire. Remove the scum with 



ENTREES. 83 



a spoon, and then pour off the clarified butter 
into another clean stew-pan. Add to this 
one pound of sifted flour well mixed with 
a wooden spoon. Continue stirring over a 
slow fire for about an hour, till of a very light 
brown colour, then pour into an earthen pan to 
be kept ready for use. 

FRENCH THICKENING. 

Put into a saucepan f lb. of fresh butter. 
When melted add 4 or 5 spoonsful of flour. 
Stir the butter and flour with a wooden spoon 
over a gentle fire till of a light brown colour. If 
required to be darker, thin it with broth, which 
must be poured boiling hot over the sauce, which 
must be allowed to stand till cold. Place it on 
the corner of the oven for nearly an hour. Skim 
the grease and the scum which form on the top, 
and then put on a brisk fire to reduce the same. 
Then take up the sauce with a spoon, and work 
backwards and forwards till well blended, but it 
must not be too thick. Then pass through a 
tammy, and add a few small pieces of butter.

the size of a walnut, until the whole becomes well 
browned ; add a wineglassful of vinegar and half 
that quantity of mushroom catsup, and a tea- 
spoonful of anchovy. When reduced to half 
add half a pint of brown sauce, a few spoonsful 
of good stock, and a wineglassful of sherry. Let

add rather better than half a pint of good stock, 
1 oz. of brown thickening, a small bit of glaze, 
and a teaspoonful of anchovy. Boil and skim.

LAMB CUTLETS with Green Peas or Beans. 

Take them from off the best end of the neck ; 
brush each cutlet over with well beaten yolk of 
egg ; sprinkle them with fine bread crumbs 
seasoned with pepper and salt. After this dip 
them separately into a little clarified butter. 
Sprinkle more crumbs over them, and fry, turning 
occasionally. Lay them before the fire to drain. 
Then dish them in a circle, with peas or French 
beans in the centre, and serve with the follow- 
ing white sauce.

Mix well and gently. 

This is an excellent preparation to put into a 
Vol au Vent case, and is called a la Toulouse.

at any confectioner's. This saves trouble, but 
whatever it is filled with ought to be made at 
home. 

VOL AU VENT OF LOBSTER. 

Cut up the flesh of the lobster into small 
pieces. Heat some lobster sauce, bind it with 
lobster butter, put the pieces of lobster into the

surface, and take them off the fire when on 
touching them with the finger they appear 
firm. Dress them in a circle on the dish, 
drain the butter off the frying pan, put in a little 
gravy to loosen the glaze which is formed at the 
bottom by the cooking of the fillets, add a 
spoonful of French thickening, boil it down, 
and serve with a little lemon juice. Make 
a maitre d'hotel butter, by adding a little 
chopped parsley to a small lump of fresh butter. 
Spread a layer between each fillet, with fried 
potatoes in the middle. This may also be served 
with Madeira sauce, by putting a wine-glass of

any sauce ; the following sauce, with truffles in 
the centre of the roll, makes an excellent dish. 

TRUFFLE SAUCE. 

Wash 10 truffles, and cut them into slices 
about the size of a penny piece. Then put 
them into a frying pan, with one tablespoonful 
of minced parsley, one minced shalot, salt and

QUENELLE OF RABBIT. 

Half boil the rabbits, then take off the meat 
and mince it. Pound well in a mortar and mix 
into a stiff paste with I egg and a little cream. 
Season with mace and white pepper. Put into 
a mould, and tie it up in a cloth. Boil for three- 
quarters of an hour. Then turn it out, and pour 
over a white sauce. The mould ought to be the 
shape of a rabbit. 

POULET k la Crapandine (Mauritius Receipt). 

Cut a chicken into halves, pepper and salt it, 
then lay it in a flat stewpan with a heavy weight 
on it. Be careful to turn the chicken very often. 
Put some butter on the fire, with onions and a 
little vinegar. When thoroughly melted add 
the chicken, and fry a nice brown, then pour 
over some good brown gravy, and serve with 
fried onions and mushrooms.

CHICKEN CUTLETS. 

Remove the white off the breast of a couple 
of young fowls. Flatten with a chopper that 
has been previously dipped in water, trim 
neatly, sprinkle over some salt, dip in egg and 
bread-crumbs, and fry them in butter to a 
light golden colour. Pass a nicely-pared chicken 
bone through each before cooking, to form a 
shank. Dish them in the same way as mutton 
cutlets, and serve with either truffle or mush- 
room sauce. 

CHICKEN CUTLETS a la Tartare. 

Half boil two chickens, and make the white and 
short bones of the legs, which must be flattened, 
into cutlets. Lard and sauter them, and serve 
very hot with the following cold sauce.

the American whisk. When quite thick add one 
tablespoonful Tarragon vinegar and a spoonful 
of French mustard, half of a very small raw 
onion chopped into powder, and twice as much 
parsley with one small saltspoonful of salt. All 
must be well mixed. 

N.B. — Cold chicken can be done in the same 
way ; a very little Cayenne is sometimes added. 

BROILED CHICKEN (Breakfast). 

To prevent cold chicken which you broil for 
breakfast from being hard and dry, rub each 
piece with oil, and bread-crumb them before 
broiling. Serve with toasted bacon, or with the 
following sauce. 

Take one large spoonful of mustard, into 
which you work two tablespoonsful of Harvey 
sauce, a teaspoonful of Chili vinegar, and the 
same of shalot vinegar, and one tablespoonful 
of claret. Heat in a silver dish over a lamp and

Take 4 good sized onions, slice them fine, and 
fry till brown and crisp. Put in a small sauce- 
pan 3 tablespoonsful of stock, 2 tablespoonsful 



ENTREES. 95 



of curry powder, a dessert-spoonful of chutnee, 
the same of sugar, and some salt, all well mixed 
together, and let it boil up once. Cut up 3 lbs. 
of uncooked meat, chicken, rabbit, or fish into 
square pieces, add a large apple, pared and cut 
into thin slices, and put all into the pan with 
the onions. Then pour over the contents of 
the small saucepan, and fry for half-an-hour 
more till of a fine rich colour. Be careful to 
keep stirring all the time to prevent burning. 
When nearly cooked, add the juice of half-a- 
lemon and a tablespoonful of Chili vinegar. 
Serve in a very hot dish, with the rice separate. 

This is a very good receipt for prawn curry, 
substituting shelled prawns for the meat. 

N.B. — I can strongly recommend the Curry 
Powder sold by Mr. Taylor, chemist, Baker Street. 

RICE for CURRY. 

Wash a cupful of rice, put it into a saucepan 
with plenty of cold water and a tablespoonful of 
salt. Let it boil for about twenty minutes, 
carefully watching it to see when the grains are 
soft. Strain through a collander, and let the 
rice dry before the fire for a few minutes, when 
each grain ought to be separate.

EGG CURRY. 

Slice two onions, and fry them in butter. Add 
a tablespoonful of curry powder. Stew all in a 
pint of good broth till the onions are quite ten- 
der. Mix in half a pint of cream or milk, and 
thicken with arrow-root or rice flour. Simmer 
a few minutes, then add six hard boiled eggs 
cut in slices. Heat thoroughly, but do not 
allow them to boil. 

CHICKEN and TOMATO SAUCE. 

Cut the chicken into joints, and let them lie 
for two hours in an earthen dish in a pickle 
made with two tablespoonsful of vinegar, with a 
little salt and pepper. Drain ; then soak each 
piece in lard or dripping, and fry. Dress them 
in a circle, garnish with fried parsley, and serve 
with tomato sauce. 

CHICKEN k la Josephine. 

Cut up the chicken into small pieces, put them 
into a stewpan with a piece of butter about 
the size of an egg y and give them a light brown 
colour, and dredge well with flour, then add finely

chopped parsley chives, and a couple of small 
onions. Let them fry for a few minutes, then 
add a little gravy (half a teacupful at a time till 
you have enough sauce), a little pepper and salt, 
a small bottle of tomato sauce, and a squeeze 
of lemon juice. If you can get fresh tomatoes 
so much the better. They must be boiled 
separately without water, with a very little 
bit of butter, and, when quite done, pass 
them through a sieve. Add them to the sauce, 
letting all stew slowly by the fire for some 
minutes before serving. 

CHICKENS k la Bresilienne. 

Cut up the fowl into pieces, and fry them a 
light brown. Chop up very fine some chives or 
green onions and parsley. Put them into a 
stewpan with the fowl, a cup of gravy or broth, 
two cloves of garlic pounded with an iron spoon, 
and two or three tablespoonsful of bacon fat. 
The latter must be made by frying some fat bacon 
till burnt to a chip, and the juice poured off 
when quite dark ; add salt and pepper to your 
taste, but it is generally made very hot, and in 
Brazil in red pepper is used. Let the whole

stew till quite tender, and serve very hot with 
rice done as follows : — 

Put the rice down in boiling water with some 
salt, 2 cloves of garlic pounded in the same way 
as for the flour, some parsley and chives, and 
let it cook till quite done, then add 2 or 3 
tablespoonsful of the bacon fat, and some pepper, 
and serve very hot. It should be quite soft and 
moist. 

POTJLET AU KIZ. 

Put the fowl in a saucepan with a pint of 
broth, 2 or 3 onions, 2 cloves, a bunch of parsley 
and thyme, a teaspoonful of salt, the same of 
pepper. Let it boil for fifteen minutes, then 
take out the thyme, parsley, and onions, add \ 
lb. of rice, which must be well washed, and let 
all stew together for half an hour more, stirring 
the rice all the time to prevent it getting into 
lumps. Serve the fowl with the rice round it, 
and pour three tablespoonsful of good gravy 
very hot over the whole. 

POTJLET AU BLANC. 

Put I lb of butter into a stewpan with two 
tablespoonsful of flour. Let the butter melt, 



ENTREES. 99 



then mix into a paste, add one pint of water and 
a dozen small onions. Put in the fowl with a 
bunch of parsley, some pepper and salt. Sim- 
mer slowly for an hour and a half. Take out 
the fowl, skin it, and put it back into the stew- 
pan with a dozen mushrooms, and let it stew 
for half an hour more, till quite done, and serve 
with the following sauce poured over it : — 

Beat up the yolks of 2 eggs in a small sauce- 
pan, squeeze in half a lemon, then add some of 
the gravy in which the fowl has been boiled, 
and stir well on the fire till the sauce is thick 
enough, being careful not to let it boil. 



CREME de VOLAILLE. 

Take either I lb. of veal or the flesh of a 
chicken, pound in a mortar, and then pass 
through a wire sieve ; then put a piece of butter, 
and again pound in a mortar, then add a little 
thick white sauce, 2 yolks of eggs, pound 
again. Then once more pass all through a 
wire sieve, and mix in 2 tablespoonsful of 
good cream and add the whites of the eggs 
well whipped; put into a shape, and steam half 
an hour. If there is a hole in the centre of

white sauce. 

CHINA CHILO. 

Take a pint-basin full of uncooked or under- 
done meat, cut it into small dice, with carrots, 
turnips, cauliflower, lettuce, French beans, or 
any vegetables you have, cut into similar pieces. 
Put all into a stewpan, with a small piece of 
butter and a cup of water, seasoning with pepper 
and salt. Let them stew till quite tender, and 
serve. Garnish round with a wall of boiled rice. 

TIMBALES. 

Take \ lb. Naples macaroni, boil until quite 
soft, drain on a cloth. Cut the macaroni in 
pieces half an inch long ; well butter a plain 
mould (or the timbale cases), line with buttered 
paper, and place the macaroni edgeways (so as 
to look like honeycomb). Make the following 

paste : — 

Put a quarter of a pint of water, a small piece 
of butter, and a little salt into a stewpan. When 
the water boils throw in a tablespoonful of flour, 
leave it a few minutes, then stir in one egg, and 
put all on a plate till wanted. Then take I lb. 



ENTREES. 101 



of veal cutlet, cold chicken, or any cold meat, 
pound in a mortar, add to it half the quantity of 
the above paste, and a quarter of the quantity 
of butter, with salt and pepper to taste. Mix 
all together, and add one whole egg and three 
yolks ; pass through a wire sieve ; stir in a 
quarter pint of white stock or milk. Pour into 
the moulds, and steam for half-an-hour. The 
timbales are also good made with rice, strewing 
cheese through them. 

OYSTERS and BACON (Kebobs). 

Take about eight nicely pared thin wooden 
skewers little more than one finger in length. 
Parboil and beard some oysters, cut some fat 
bacon the same size as an oyster ; then run a 
skewer first through an oyster, then a bit of 
bacon, and so on till each skewer is filled. They 
must then be bread-crumbed, and fried in fat, 
and sent up very hot nicely piled one on the 
other. 

GERMAN VEAL CUTLETS 
(called Wiener Schnitzel). 

Cut some slices from a leg of veal about a 
finger thick. Flatten them with a beater which 



102 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

has been previously wetted. Sprinkle them on 
each side with salt and pepper ; coat them with 
bread crumbs and white of egg. Fry them in 
butter till of a bright golden colour, but do not 
give them too much of the fire, or they will not 
retain their juice and will be dry. Serve them 
on a dish, over which pour the butter in which 
they have been cooked. Put crossways on each 
slice two narrow strips of anchovies, sprinkling 
over all some capers without the vinegar, and 
add slices of lemon. 

VEAL SCOLLOPS aux Fines Herbs, or with 
Sauce Italienne. 

Take a piece of fillet about 2\ lbs., — remove 
all bone, gristle, and skin. 

Cut the veal into equal slices, and flatten 
them with a beater. Cover the frying dish with 
a layer of butter, then cover the layer over with 
salt and pepper. 

Range the scollops on the dish close to each 
other, and dust them also with salt and pepper. 
Cook them over a sharp fire on both sides for 
four minutes. Remove the meat and put it on 
a plate. Put \ oz. flour into the frying pan, and 



EX TREES. 



stir over the fire for a minute with a wooden 
spoon. Add three wineglassesful of broth or 
stock, and boil for five minutes. If any gravy 
has come from the scollops while on the plate, 
add it to the sauce. 

Dress the scollops in a pyramid (or with the 
roll in the centre) on the dish they are to be 
served in. Put the sauce on the fire, and at the 
first boiling add I oz. butter cut into six pieces, 
and a tablespoonful of minced parsley. Stir 
with the spoon so as to melt the butter. Pour 
the sauce on the scollops and serve ; or they 
may be served with Sauce Italienne. 

ROGNONS a la Brochette (Kidneys). 

Put the kidneys for some minutes in water. 
Make a small incision on the opposite side of 
the sinew. Remove the fine skin which is over 
the kidneys, and split it without separating 
them. Pass a silver skewer through to prevent 
them closing during broiling. Put pepper and 
salt, dip them in oil or clarified butter, and broil 
them over a quick fire. When done take out 
the skewers, and put into each kidney some 
butter the size of a walnut, into which knead 



104 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

some minced parsley and lemon juice. Serve 
on a hot plate. This is a very nice breakfast 
dish. 

HARE CUTLETS. 

(Cotelettes de Lievre — Sauce Groseille.) 
Prepare two hares, as if for roasting. Keep 
the blood. Thrust the knife along the back- 
bone to the leg, and then slipping the fingers 
between the bones and the fillet, detach the 
fillet, but without separating from the leg the 
thick end which holds it. Pass the point of 
the knife underneath that part, and draw the 
fillet towards you. When you have thus taken 
off the four fillets, spread them on the table, 
and divide each into three parts. Cut them on 
the bias, so that one end is thick and the other 
thin. 

Flatten them gently, and trim them in the 
form of cutlets, of which there ought to be twelve. 
Run a shank through each. Season with pepper 
and salt. Pass lightly on each a little brush of 
feathers dipped into the yolk of an egg, bread- 
crumb them very finely. Soak the cutlets into 
some very hot clarified butter. Bread-crumb 
them a second time. Pass the blade of the 



ENTREES. io5 



knife lightly over them to gloss them. Put 
some butter melted into a stewpan — place the 
cutlets in and sautez them like ordinary cutlets. 
Put a frill of paper round each cutlet, and dish 
them as already described, (see page 75), with 
the following sauce. 



SAUCE GROSEILLE. 

Dissolve about three teaspoonsful of currant 
jelly in the same quantity of water, and heat 
over the fire, adding a little isinglass if necessary. 

RABBIT CUTLETS. 

Take the back of the rabbits, skin them care- 
fully, and raise the fillets over the bone. Then 
cut off two pieces the size of a finger from each 
fillet, and flatten them as for cutlets ; run a bone 
of the rabbit through each to make the shank. 
Lard each cutlet and fry in butter for barely 
three minutes, sprinkling them with a little 
salt while on the fire. Make a gravy with 
the meat and bones left of the rabbit, adding 
truffles or mushrooms.

SALMI OF PHEASANT. 

Roast a pheasant, taking care not to let 
it be overdone. When cold, cut into thin 
pieces and put them in the saucepan. Pound 
the bones and trimmings, and boil in brown 
stock for half-an-hour with a few shalots, half 
a laurel leaf and a pinch of pepper. 

Strain through a napkin, skim carefully, and 
boil the strained broth over a sharp fire for a 
few moments. Add a little brown thickening 
and a glass of white wine ; keep stirring over 
the fire till the sauce is of the right consistency, 
then mix in a pinch of salt, a very little sugar, 
and some lemon, and pour all over the pheasant 
that has been cut up. Heat the salmi in the 
bain marie, then arrange the pieces neatly in a 
very hot dish, with the sauce over them. A 
truffle sauce is a great addition to this most 
excellent dish. 



SALMI OF WILD DUCK. 

Proceed in the same manner as for Salmi of 
Pheasant.

LARDED SWEETBREADS. 

Soak for an hour in tepid water to cleanse 
them. Then whiten in cold water till firm 
enough to pass a larding-pin through with- 
out tearing them. 

Wash and drain — press them a little to give 
them a flat form, and after trimming lard them. 
Put into the bottom of a saucepan some nar- 
row strips of bacon, on which place the sweet- 
breads, which are to be cooked with fire 
above and beneath the saucepan. Done in 
this manner, they do not require the addition of 
gravy or broth. Half an hour of the fire is 
enough for them. Glaze and serve Tomato or 
any other sauce. 

RIZ DE VEAU en Caisses (Sweetbreads). 

Oil the paper cases externally, and put at 
the bottom of each case some stuffing made 
by the following receipt, then the sweetbread, 
then cover with more stuffing and some bread 
crumbs. Bake for a quarter of an hour.

STUFFING. 

Mince the following ingredients very fine : — 
\ lb. fat bacon, some mushrooms and shalots, 
add \ lb. butter and 4 tablespoonsful of oil. 
Put on the fire for five minutes ; add chopped 
parsley, then heat again for two minutes, season 
with pepper, salt, and spice, and lay it aside for 
use. 

N.B. — This stuffing is very useful for cutlets, 
tongues, &c. 

CALF'S LIVER a la Francaise. 

Mince the liver, and also four large onions. 
Put a good bit of butter in the pan, and when 
melted put in the onions. When they begin to 
brown add the liver, and fry with the onions, 
and when done sprinkle over a tablespoonful of 
flour. Add either a glass of white wine or 
broth, and a drop of vinegar. Season with 
pepper and salt, and serve hot. Be very care- 
ful to stir the liver well, to allow the sauce 
to thicken properly. Do not let it boil, and 
serve as soon as thick enough.

POTATOES k la Maitre d'Hotel. 

Boil the potatoes and while hot cut them into 
slices about twice as thick as a shilling. Take 
a lump of butter about the size of a walnut — 
put in a stewpan on the fire and when melted 
dredge in as much flour as will thicken it. Add 
half-a-pint of good Stock, 2 tablespoonsful of 
cream, and a little parsley chopped very fine. 
Season with pepper and salt. Boil up once, 
and then put in the potatoes. They must not 
be stirred but merely heated — taking great care 
not to let them break. 

SIEVED POTATOES. 

Boil the potatoes carefully, then pass them 
through a sieve, add salt and a little pepper, 



1 1 6 SHORTS DINNERS A T HOME. 

and put the dish on which they are to be served 
into the oven for a few minutes. 

POTATO SOUFFLES. 

Bake some good-sized raw potatoes for an 
hour and a-half. Scrape out the inside without 
spoiling the shell. Mix with the potatoes some 
flour, a bit of butter the size of a nut, a pinch 
of salt, and as much cream as will make it the 
consistency of thick cream. Put it into a stew- 
pan, and boil for a few minutes, stirring all the 
time with a fork ; then fill the potatoe shells 
with the mixture, heaping it up very high, and 
be careful to do it loosely, so as to allow the 
souffles to rise. Put them into a quick oven for 
ten minutes. Have ready a dish with a napkin 
on it. Lay them on it, and serve at once, before 
they fall. 

PUREE de POMMES de TERRE. 

Put into a saucepan 2 lbs. of mealy potatoes 
well washed and peeled, cover with water, 
add salt, and when nearly three-quarters boiled 
throw away the water and put them in the

a tammy, a small quantity at a time, then put 
the puree into a saucepan, add a little butter, 
one or two yolks of eggs, and some cream. 

TURNIPS WITH CREAM. 

Pare and wash in hot water, then put them on 
the fire in boiling stock ; add a little butter and 
salt, and boil gently till tender, keeping the 
saucepan well covered all the time; pour off the 
broth, and boil again with some flour, mixed 
with a little butter, a pinch of pepper, some 
cream, and a very little sugar, and serve very 
hot. 

SPINACH. 

Let the spinach be well washed, and soak in 
cold water till you are ready to cook it. Put it 
into a saucepan of boiling water, and when done

butter, and salt, and boil till tender ; then drain 
through a sieve. Serve on a dish with the 
following sauce : — Beat 6 oz. of butter to cream, 
mix in the yolks of 3 eggs, and a spoonful of 
flour. Pour some of the water in which the 
cauliflower has been boiled gradually into the 
sauce, constantly stirring while on the fire till of 
the right consistency. When on the point of 
boiling take it off the fire, and add a little 
butter. 

BAKED CAULIFLOWER. 

After the cauliflower is boiled, let it drain 
on a napkin. Prepare a thick sauce accord- 
ing to previous receipt, and let it get cool. 
Arrange the cauliflower on the dish in which it 
is to be served, cover it with the sauce, scatter 
over thickly some bread crumbs and grated 
Parmesan cheese, and bake in a very hot oven, 
taking the precaution of placing the dish on a 
baking tin, covered with ashes or salt a finger 
deep. 

CELERY WITH DUTCH SAUCE. 

Pare the heads nicely, and cut into lengths, 
then boil them in salt water till tender. Then

drain off all the water, and pour a Dutch sauce 
over the celery. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Peel the asparagus smooth and fine, then 
wash and tie in bundles of ten or fifteen — taking 
care that the heads are all of the same size — 
the ends cut even, put them into boiling water 
slightly salted, and boil over a quick fire. If 
to be dished immediately, boil till quite tender 
(from ten to fifteen minutes will be sufficient) 
but if obliged to boil them some time before 
wanted it is better to leave them only half the 
time on the fire, and then in a hot place till 
sufficiently tender. 

Lay the asparagus on a cloth till the water is 
completely drained off, and then serve with 
either the same sauce given for cauliflower, 
melted butter, or Dutch sauce. 

SALSIFIS. 

This is a vegetable not often met with in 
England. It is excellent when properly dressed. 
Take off the skin and scrape till quite white,

time. Drain and serve with the following 
sauce : — For a large dish take two tablespoonsful 
of flour, mix with some milk and \ lb. of butter, 
add salt and pepper, always stirring on the fire. 
When the sauce is ready, just before serving 
add the yolk of an egg well beaten up in a 
bowl, and a little vinegar. 

SCALLOPED SALSIFIS. 

Boil some Salsifis roots till tender — cut them 
across into slices. Stew in half-a-pint of good 
white sauce — with a tablespoonful of anchovy.

ARTICHOKES. 

Cut the tops, stalks, and outer leaves of the 

artichokes, pare off the green from the bottoms, 

rub the latter with lemon juice, and throw the 

artichokes into cold water, then boil them in salt 

and water till sufficiently tender to allow of the 

inner leaves being removed. Let the artichokes 

cool in cold water, take away first the small 

middle leaves, and then the choke, wash again 

and put them into a saucepan with a little stock 

or water, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and butter, 

and simmer over a gentle fire till tender. The 

lid of the saucepan must always be kept on.

PEAS. 

The peas ought to be very young. Boil them 
in very bubbling salt and water for a quarter of 
an hour, then pass through a collander to drain, 
and dish them with small lumps of fresh butter. 

When the peas are getting older the following 
is a very good mode of cooking them. Pour 
over them three or four tablespoonsful of water, 
add some fresh butter, and simmer over the 
fire till tender, constantly shaking the pan. 

When the peas are soft, mix in some butter 
and flour, to the proportion of two table 
spoonsful of butter and half a tablespoonful 
of flour to two quarts of peas. Shake again 
over the fire, add chopped parsley, and let them 
heat but not boil any more. When ready to 
serve add a little sugar ; and some water or 
broth if too thick ; but if too thin a little more 
butter and flour. 



PUREE OF GREEN PEAS. 

Thick green peas are the best for this dish. 
Boil till tender in broth or water, with a little 
butter and salt, then pass through a sieve with

a bunch of parsley which has been boiled in 
water, and make into a thick pulp with a lump 
of fresh butter, some broth, sugar, and a little 
salt, and stir on the fire till heated through. 

PRESERVED GREEN PEAS. 

Take a tin of preserved peas ; pour them into 
a collander to drain off the juice ; then take 
two tablespoonsful of butter, well mixed with 
one of flour, add some broth or water, and boil 
all into a thick sauce, putting in a little salt, 
sugar, and chopped parsley. Just before serving 
stir the sauce hot, then put in the peas, and 
shake the pan over the fire till they are heated 
through, and serve. 

DRIED GREEN PEAS 

Steep for twenty-four hours in river or rain 
water, put on the fire in cold water, and boil 
till very tender. Pour into a collander to drain, 
and proceed as in previous receipt for preserved 
green peas. 

FRENCH BEANS. 

When young the best way of dressing French 
beans is to cut them in thin strips, and to boil

SADDLE OF MUTTON. 

This is a less expensive dish for a small party 
than is imagined. The Alderman's Walk being 
cut out, makes one dish (see Filet Mignon), a 
roast joint the second, and the following day 
it can be heated up by placing a piece of 
buttered paper over it, and roasting it again 
carefully ; and after that the remains can be 
made into rissole cutlets, the bones being put 
into the stock pot. 

LOIN OF MUTTON (Boned). 

Bone a loin of mutton, take off the flap and 
skin, then flour it and put it into a stewpan, the 
ean side downwards, with a pint of water, an 
onion, and a few cloves. Stew it gently for an

wards, and stew it for an hour and a half longer. 



1 30 SHORTS DINNERS A T HOME. 

Skim the gravy well, and then add a glass of 
port wine and a teaspoonful of essence of 
anchovy. 

FILLET OF BEEF. 

Get a sirloin of beef. To get a good fillet for 
an end dish it must be pretty large. Cut out 
the fillet, trim and lard it the night before, and 
let it lie until the next day in a seasoning of 
pepper, salt, onions cut into shreds, and parsley 
in branches. Just before putting to the fire, 
take away the parsley and onion. Put it on 
the spit with buttered paper, roast, and five 
minutes before it is done take off the paper. 
Serve in its own gravy, garnish with bunches 
of carrots, turnips, and cauliflowers, — Madeira 
sauce in a separate boat. 



MADEIRA SAUCE. 

Put into a saucepan f pint of Madeira, 1 \ oz. 
of glaze, and a pinch of mignonette pepper. 
Reduce it to half. Add ij pint of French 
thickening, and continue reducing till the sauce 
coats the spoon.

STEWED SIRLOIN OF BEEF. 

After the fillet has been taken out, carefully re- 
move the bones of the sirloin. Spread it flat on 
a table ; strew over it a little salt and pepper, and 
then cover the inside with thin slices of striped 
bacon. Roll and bind up the meat firmly. Lay 
it in a thick iron saucepan of nearly its size. Add 
the bones, and as much good beef-broth as will 
nearly cover the joint. As soon as it has boiled 
a few minutes, and been well cleaned from scum, 
throw in a large bunch of savoury herbs, leeks, 
and one onion, stuck with a dozen cloves. An 
hour later add two blades of mace and half a 
dozen peppercorns. Stew the beef very gently 
from four to five hours, or longer. Serve 
with brown caper sauce. Add what salt may 
be needed before the vegetables are thrown in, 
and after the meat is lifted out the liquor in 
which it has been stewed will make very good 
soup. 

VEAL, 

(a la Bourgeoise). 

Take a piece of veal, with some of the kidney 
fat, or a bit of a fillet. Put it with a little butter 



1 32 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

in the saucepan on the fire till of a good 
colour. Then add half-a-pint of water, a bunch 
of herbs, 2 or 3 onions, pepper, and salt, some 
carrots (or potatoes which have been half-done), 
and let it simmer over a slow fire for about three 
hours ; the lid of the saucepan must be kept 
on, putting fire on the top. Strain and serve. 

FRICANDEAU OF VEAL. 

Take the centre part of a hind quarter of 
veal, trim, and remove the skin and gristle, 
and lard it. Line the bottom of a saucepan 
with carrots and onions. Add a little gravy or 
broth, and cook very gently, with fire above and 
beneath, for three hours, and baste with its own 
gravy, taking care not to let it brown. Skim 
and thicken the gravy, and serve with a Puree 
d'Oseille (Sorrel), spinach, peas, or tomatoes. 

N.B. — This may be served either as an end 
or side dish. 

PUREE OF SORREL (OSEILLE). 

Take about two handfuls of sorrel, pick and 
put it into a saucepan on the fire. When 
the juice is extracted pass through a tammy;

then add a little butter, pepper, and salt, and 

heat again for a few minutes on the fire. 

Before serving add a little cream and the yolks 
of 2 eggs. 

ROAST LAMB. 

Take a hindquarter of lamb. Cut off the 
knuckle-bone, put it on the spit. Roast, dress, 
garnish with water-cress, and serve with horse- 
radish sauce. 

SADDLE OF LAMB. 

Trim a saddle of lamb, and put it on the spit. 
Roast it, and serve with water-cresses and sauce 
piquante. 

SHOULDER OF LAMB. 

This is very good with Tomato sauce. 

BOILED CHICKENS. 

They must be boiled gently, and in order to 
have them very white, just as they are on the 
point of boiling take them out, skim and put 
them back into the pot. Serve with white celery 
or mushroom sauce, and slices of lemon. 



1 34 SHOR T S DINNERS A T HOME. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Proceed in same manner and put the usual 
stuffing. 

WHITE SAUCE FOR CHICKENS. 

Take about one quart of white stock, put it 
into a stew-pan with a little parsley, herbs, and 
a bay leaf. Add a little salt. When it has boiled 
long enough just to taste of the herbs, strain 
and boil it up again till reduced nearly one- 
half. Mix a tablespoonful of arrowroot with a 
pint of cream, and simmer very gently for five 
minutes over a slow fire. Add the prepared 
stock to it, and simmer slowly for ten minutes, 
if the sauce is thick ; but if too thin, stir over 
a sharp fire till it thickens. It is better to be 
thick, because it can always be thinned with 
either cream, milk, or stock. 

MUSHROOM SAUCE. 

Take J pint button mushrooms, cut off the 
stalks and wipe free from grits. Dip into 
lemon-juice and water, to whiten them. Chop 
fine, and put into a saucepan with I oz. of 
butter. When soft add half a pint of white

sauce, and simmer till done enough. Rub all 
through a tammy, and serve very hot. 

CELERY SAUCE. 

Boil six heads of celery in salt and water till 
tender, and cut into pieces two inches long. 
Put one pint of white stock into a stewpan with 
a few herbs and a little mace, and simmer for 
half an hour to extract their flavour. Then 
strain, add the celery, and a thickening of 
butter kneaded with a little arrowroot. Just 
before serving put in about \ pint of cream. 
Boil up, and add a little lemon-juice. 

CHICKENS with TARRAGON LEAVES. 
(Poulets k l'Estragon). 

Make a white sauce with consomme of chicken, 
and bind it with the yolks of two or three eggs, 
adding a good handful of chopped tarragon 
leaves. Half-boil the chickens, then take them 
out, and skin them ; put them back into the 
above sauce, and boil till sufficiently done. 

N.B. — Tarragon is not much grown in Eng- 
land, which is to be regretted. In foreign 
countries it is much used in cookery. The roots

may be procured from France, and will be found 
to grow perfectly well in England. 

ROAST CHICKENS. 

Before roasting, tie on each side of the breast 
a slice of fat bacon, and put a bit of butter and 
half an onion inside. Keep basting with butter. 
Serve with water-cress and bread sauce. 



ROAST TURKEY with Oysters. 
(American Receipt.) 

Prepare the turkey for roasting ; then stuff it, 
leaving plenty of room for the stuffing to swell. 
Sew up with coarse thread. Then make several 
cuts in the fleshy part of the bird with a sharp 
knife. Press a good-sized plump oyster into 
each cut, as far in as possible. Draw the skin 
over it tightly, and make it cover each cut. 
Sprinkle over some flour, pepper and salt, and 
put a little of each into the dripping-pan, with 
some water. Baste the turkey constantly with 
its own drippings. Bake a clear golden brown, 
taking care not to scorch it. 



REMOVES. 137 



BREAD SAUCE. 

Peel and slice an onion, and simmer in a 
pint of new milk until tender. Take about a 
breakfastcupful of stale bread ; break it into 
small pieces into a saucepan. Strain the 
hot milk over it (having taken the onion out), 
cover close, and soak for one hour. Then 
beat up smooth with a fork. Add a very little 
cayenne, salt, and I oz. of butter. Boil and 
serve. 



ROAST CAPON. 

To be roasted the same as chicken, and 
served with bread or egg sauce. 



ROAST DUCKS with TARRAGON LEAVES. 

(Canards k l'Estragon). 

Roast the ducks, (they ought to be rather 
under- than over- done), and then heat them 
in the tarragon sauce, the same as for the 
chickens. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

Roast as chicken, and serve with chestnut 
and apple sauce. 



1 38 SHORTS DINNERS A T HOME. 

CHESTNUT AND APPLE SAUCE. 

Peel the chestnuts, throw them into boiling 
water, let them just come to the boil, then take 
off the fire, remove the second skin, and wash 
them. Boil till tender, and then stew them in a 
little butter and sugar. 

Peel and slice some apples, steam in a little 
water till tender, add some wine, sugar, and 
lemon-peel, and mix with the chestnuts. 

HAM. 

Soak the ham for a few hours in vinegar 
and water. Then put it on the fire with suffi- 
cient cold water to cover it, bring it gradually 
to the boil, and as the scum rises, carefully 
remove it. Simmer very gently until tender. 
When it boils add 2 heads of celery, 2 turnips, 
3 onions and a large bunch of savoury herbs. 
When done take the ham out, strip off the skin, 
cover with bread raspings, and put a frill round 
the knuckle. If to be eaten cold, the ham must 
remain in the water till nearly cold. Then re- 
move the skin and glaze it.

ROAST DUCKLINGS and PEAS

TURKEY POULTS and GUINEA FOWL. 

Turkey poults and guinea fowl ought to be 
larded, and a bit of butter, with half an onion, 
put into the breast, and served with bread sauce. 



GAME. 

Brown game must be most carefully roasted, 
rather under- than over- done, especially wild 
fowl. The too common defect of badly-made 
toast and indifferent melted butter ruins both the 
look and the flavour of the birds. For roasting 
game see that the fire is clear, and the birds 
kept well basted, floured, and frothed. 



144 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

The following receipt for cooking game is 
preferred by many to roasting : — 

Put a good sized piece of butter into a 
saucepan. Put the bird breast downwards in 
the pan. Put the lid on, and cook for ten 
minutes, then turn the bird on its back and 
cook for five minutes ; then, if not sufficiently 
done, turn it on its breast again, and let it 
cook for another five minutes. Make a piece 
of crisp toast, pour a little of the butter over it. 
Place the bird on it, and serve very hot. 

WOODCOCK. 

Roast them as above, from about fifteen to 
twenty minutes. Place some slices of toast 
very crisp and thin in the dripping-pan to 
catch the trails. Serve with a little gravy, round 
not over them, and with melted butter in a 
separate boat. 

N.B. — The receipt of an epicure for cooking 
a woodcock was to keep it a long time, and to 
remove the trail ; and then, when ready to be 
cooked, to put the trail of a fresh woodcock 
inside. 



ROASTS. 145 



SNIPE 

Must be done and served in the same way 
as woodcock, and sent up very hot and expedi- 
tiously. 

WILD DUCK 

Must be roasted and served with slices of 
lemon, and hot Cumberland sauce. 

WILD DUCK (German Fashion). 

Prepare the bird as for roasting ; rub in some 
flour, and put it on the fire, with butter on both 
sides of the breast and back, till brown, and 
then stew over a moderate fire with a little 
water, a glass of wine, an onion, some herbs, 
and a little salt, keeping them constantly basted. 
Thin the gravy with a little water or broth, 
sharpen with lemon-juice and add some anchovy 
butter, and pass through a sieve. 



Partridges, Grouse, and Pheasants are gene- 
rally roasted, and served with bread sauce ; but 
boiled pheasant with cream sauce has the merit 
of novelty. 



1 46 SHORTS DINNERS A T HOME. 



BOILED PHEASANT. 

Let the pheasant be boiled the same way as 
a chicken, and serve with cream sauce. 

CREAM SAUCE. 

Put 2 oz. of butter into a saucepan, dredge in a 
teaspoonful of flour, and keep shaking round till 
the butter is melted. Add salt and a very little 
cayenne, and one-third of a pint of good 
cream, stirring the whole till it boils. Let it 
simmer for five minutes, when add a little lemort 
juice. 

CUMBERLAND SAUCE for Game (Cold). 

One teaspoonful mustard powder dissolved in 
a large glass of claret, adding some currant jelly 
and some chopped orange and lemon peel. 

CUMBERLAND SAUCE (Hot). 
Drain from all fat some good gravy from 
roasted meat ; add a little stock, a glass of 
strong wine, some currant jelly, and mustard 
powder. Then strain through a sieve.

SAVOURY DISHES. 

(Generally included in the bill of fare under the 
heading of " Rots.") 

OMELETTES. 

The success of an omelette depends upon 
the following essentials. First, the eggs must 
not be beaten for more than one minute ; 
secondly, the pan must not be used for any 
other purpose; and thirdly, the omelette ought 
not to be served till the very moment it is 
required. 

OMELETTE aux Fines Herbes. 

Break 6 eggs into an earthen pan. Add 5 
pinches of salt, 3 of pepper, and half a table- 
spoonful of minced parsley. Whip them with a 
fork to break the whites, and to amalgamate 
them with the yolks, but only for one minute. 



1 52 SHOR T'S DINNERS A T HOME. 

See that the pan is very clean. Put 3 oz. of 
butter into it, and put it on a sharp fire. Shake 
it so that the butter melts, but without being 
coloured. When it is hot, throw in the eggs, 
and toss with the fork, so that they are done 
equally. 

When they begin to be set, shake the pan, 
and turn it. Fold down the two sides of the 
omelette, so as to give it an oval shape. 
Santez it lightly to colour it, and then toss it on 
the dish and serve at once. For a smaller 
omelette 3 or 4 eggs only may be used. 

HAM OMELETTE. 

Proceed as in the previous receipt, adding to 
the beaten eggs \ lb. of lean cooked ham cut 
into small squares, with a little pepper. 

OMELETTE aux Eognons. 

Santez three kidneys and place them in the 
middle of the omelette. 

CHEESE OMELETTE. 

Prepare the omelette according to the first 
receipt, but without parsley. Season with a little 



SA VO UR Y DISHES. 1 53 

salt and pepper. Grate 1 oz. Parmesan cheese, 
and add it to the beaten eggs. Serve very 
hot, and before turning over the sides of the 
omelette, scatter over 1 oz. Gruyere cheese. 

SOUFFLE an Fiomage. 

Take \ lb. grated cheese, add the yolks of 2 
eggs well beaten, to which add half a pint of 
boiling milk, which has been poured on some 
crumbs of bread (the crumb of a penny roll is 
best). Before putting in the oven add the 
whites of 4 eggs, well beaten, and serve imme- 
diately. 

BUTTERED EGGS. 

Melt a small lump of butter in the saucepan, 
then put in three eggs, well beaten and a little 
salt. Stir well on the fire. When almost done 
take off the saucepan, and keep stirring for a 
few minutes Spread some anchovy paste on 
hot buttered toast, then lay the buttered eggs on 
the top. 

SCOTCH WOODCOCK. 

Split 6 anchovies, bone, wash, and warm 

before the fire. Mix 2 eggs, with one table- 
K 



154 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

spoonful of cream. Put all into the saucepan 
and stir continually over the fire until thick, 
then add a little grated tongue over it. 

ANCHOVY CANAPEES. 

Take some squares of bread with the crust cut 
off and fry them in butter a light golden colour, 
free some anchovies from the bones and clean 
them well, then take half of them, mince 
fine, and pass them through a sieve, with 
the yolks of 4 hard-boiled eggs. Mix into a 
thick paste with some butter and oil. Add 
mustard, pepper, chopped parsley, chives, capers, 
a little tarragon, and plain vinegar. Spread on 
the toast while it is very hot, and lay on each 
piece the remainder of the anchovies cut into 
neat strips. 

CHEESE CANAPEES. 

Take 4 oz. grated cheese, 2 oz. pounded ham, 
a large tablespoonful of mixed mustard, a very 
little Cayenne pepper and salt. Mix into a 
paste with the yolk of an egg, spread it thickly 
between two thin slices of bread, cut into shapes, 
and fry for one minute in boiling lard. 



SA VO UR Y DISHES. 1 55 



SCOLLOPED EGGS— (American Receipt). 

Take some fine bread crumbs, pepper, salt, 
parsley, and some melted butter. Make it into 
a soft paste with milk, and half fill some scol- 
lop-shells with the mixture. 

Break one egg carefully upon the top of each, 
dust with pepper and salt. Set in the oven, 
and bake for about eight minutes until the eggs 
are well set. 

OYSTERS IN SHELLS. 

Parboil the oysters, and put them in the pan, 
with some fresh butter, finely-chopped herbs, 
seasoned with a little pepper, and a glassful of 
white wine. Santcz them without boiling ; 
when the sauce is thick, add the yolks of 2 
or 3 eggs, and the juice of a lemon. 

Put 3 or 4 oysters into each shell, cover with 
the sauce, bread-crumb, and heat them in the 
oven for a few minutes. 

MACARONI AND CHEESE. 

Boil the macaroni in milk, adding more milk 
as it soaks up. Boil very slowly fully two hours. 



1 56 SHORTS DINNERS A T HOME. 

Then butter a flat dish, and put in the macaroni. 
Grate some cheese over it, lay small bits of 
butter over the cheese, and put it in the oven. 
Add a rim of pastry round the dish, if liked. 

BLOATERS ON TOAST. 

Parboil 3 or 4 bloaters just long enough to 
allow the skin to come off easily. Remove it, 
and take out the meat in fillets (four to each 
fish). Have ready some slices of well-buttered 
toast. Lay a fillet on each, and then trim all 
to the same size. Rub each fillet over with 
some butter, a slight dust of cayenne and black 
pepper, and put them in the oven to get quite 
hot, then serve. 

HAM TOAST. 

Take some finely-minced ham, and mix it 
with sufficient cream to make a thin paste, and 
boil five minutes. Have ready a well-buttered 
toast and lay the mixture on it. Then strew 
some bread crumbs mixed with a little parsley 
on the top, and brown in the oven. 

OYSTER TOAST. 

Scald a quart of fresh, large, plump oysters 
in their own liquor. Then pound them in a 



SA VO UR Y DISHES. 1 57 

mortar till they form a paste. Add a little 
cream, pepper, and salt if necessary. Have 
ready some squares of hot toast, on which spread 
the oyster paste. Heat in the oven, and just 
before serving sprinkle over some finely-chopped 
pickles. 

CHEESE STRAWS. 

Rub I lb. of butter into J lb. of flour, add J lb. 
grated Parmesan cheese, a teaspoonful of flour 
of mustard, a saltspoonful of cayenne, and one 
of salt. Mix all well together, then add the whites 
of 2 eggs well beaten with J pint of cold water, 
and make into a firm paste. Knead, and then 
roll it out the eighth of an inch thick, and cut 
into strips, each about 5 inches long. * Bake 
in a quick oven (for about five minutes) till of a 
pale brown colour. Pile the straws prettily on a 
dish and serve hot. 

TOASTED CHEESE. 

Put 4 oz. of double Gloucester cheese in a 
saucepan, with two tablespoonsful of cream and 
two pats of butter. Then put on the fire and 
stir till boiling ; take it off and stir in one well- 
whisked egg. Put it back on the fire, and con- 



1 58 SHORTS DINNERS AT h OME. 

tinue stirring until just on the point of boiling, 
when pour into a dish and brown it with a sala- 
mander. Be very careful that it does not boil, 
or it will curdle. 

STEWED PRAWNS. 

Put into a stew-pan a heaped tablespoonful of 
flour and 3 J oz. butter. Blend carefully 
without heating, add pepper and salt and a 
glassful of warm water. Put the mixture on the 
fire and stir it — two minutes will be enough. 
Then take it off, add the juice of a lemon and 
6 oz. butter. Stir till the butter is melted. 
If the sauce is too thick add water till of the 
right consistency, and keep hot without boil- 
ing. Skin the prawns and put them in the 
sauce. 

N.B. — This preparation is also very good for 
filling a vol au vent case. 

STEWED LOBSTER. 

Take the flesh, brain, and coral of the lobster, 
and put into a saucepan with a good lump 
of butter, a little vinegar, and cayenne, and 
heat thoroughly. 



SA VO UR Y DISHES. 1 59 



N.B. — This is much the best way of dressing 
hot lobster. Avoid sauces or flavourings. 



SALAD SAUCE. 

Put the yolks of 4 fresh eggs into a basin, 
mix in drop by drop one quart bottle of oil, and 
stir with a wooden spoon till all is worked into a 
good lump. Add 2 teaspoonsful of salt, 2 teas- 
poonsful of made mustard, 2 tablespoonsful of 
Chili and the same of French vinegar, Worcester- 
shire and Harvey sauce. Mix all well. Then add 
by degrees 1 quart of good cream, and bottle 
for use. This will keep, if well made, for six 
months, and is far superior to the preparations 
sold as salad dressings. 



MAYONNAISE SAUCE. 

Mix the yolk of one raw egg, and the yolk 
of a hard-boiled tgg well together, add drop 
by drop 5 or 6 tablespoonsful of oil, 1 table- 
spoonful of Tarragon vinegar, a little chutney, 
and 1 spoonful of meat jelly. This proportion 
is for four people. 



160 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

PRAWN SALAD. 

This is even better than lobster salad. 

Make the Mayonnaise as above, which is im- 
proved by being placed on ice for an hour be- 
fore using. Then put in your fish shelled, and 
garnish the dish with hard-boiled eggs cut in 
quarters. 

WINTER SALAD. 

Cut 2 Spanish onions, well boiled, into slices, 
arrange them neatly in a salad bowl, and just 
before serving pour over a dressing composed of 
good cream, vinegar, mustard and salt to taste. 
Add beetroot which has been boiled two hours 
— and then cut in slices. 

MEAT JELLY FOR ASPIC. 

Split 6 fresh calves' feet. After having re- 
moved the upper part of the bone, put it on the 
fire with 3 lbs. of beef and 5 quarts of water. 
Skim well. Add two onions, some carrots, 
celery, shalot, 2 laurel leaves, a little pepper. 
Simmer gently from four to five hours, pass 
through a sieve, then boil again till reduced to 
two quarts. Let it get cold and stiffen. Then 



SA VOURY DISHES. 161 

remove all the fat, adding vinegar, a little 
white wine, and some fresh tarragon leaves. 
Then beat up 3 eggs, with a little water 
and the crushed shells of the eggs. Beat all 
well together and mix with the jelly, and let it 
boil up again, constantly whisking it while on 
the fire. Leave it on the side of the fire without 
touching it for half-an-hour till the eggs have 
set. Then let it drain through a cloth back 
and forwards till quite clear. Keep the aspic 
in an earthen or china vessel for use. 

N.B. — If required to be of a dark colour, add 
some meat gravy before clearing. 

ASPIC JELLY. 

Cut out the flesh of a fine lobster into scallops 
and season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. 
Spread on a flat baking-tin a layer of French 
butter, set it on ice, and when frozen cut out of 
it, with a paste-cutter, scallops the same size as 
the lobster scallops. Proceed in the same 
manner with the lobster butter. Now take a 
mould and fill the bottom with aspic jelly, 
decorating it with truffles and the whites of 
eggs. Then fill up the mould with alternate 



1 62 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

rounds of lobster and butter in the following 
order : — 

First, a round of lobster scallops, then one of 
French butter, the next a round of lobster 
scallops, then one of lobster butter, the con- 
cluding rounds to be scallops of lobster and 
lobster butter (each scallop alternated), and the 
last round scallops of lobster and French butter 
alternated. Each round must be separated by a 
layer of jelly, and after each layer set the mould 
on ice, so as to make a firm foundation upon 
which to lay the next round. Finish by the 
layer of jelly. When sufficiently iced, turn out 
of the mould and serve on a base of rice made 
as follows: — Take some rice, wash, and then 
boil in salt and water. Cover the saucepan so as 
to allow the rice to burst, simmer over a gentle 
fire. Pound the rice and put into a narrow 
oval mould. When cold turn out, and cover it 
with French butter to colour it. This is not to 
be cut, but forms a good base for the jelly. 

FRENCH BUTTER. 

Take a handful each of chervil, Tarragon, 
Burnet, chives, and watercresses. 



SA VOURY DISHES. 



Pick and wash them, scald for two minutes 
in boiling water, drain and let them cool. Hav-

in the egg mixture and do the omelet over 
a pretty sharp fire till the side near the pan is 
of a light brown colour. Now slip the omelet 
from the pan on to a sheet of paper and cover 
the other uncoloured side with apricot, rasp- 
berry, or any kind of jam ; roll the omelet 
together, lay it on a dish, sprinkle over some 
powdered sugar, pass the salamander across the 
top, and serve very hot.

POMMES & la Parisienne. 

Scald 6 fine apples, peel them, and cut into 
quarters, and rub them with lemon. Boil 2 
oz. of rice in some milk. When the rice is 
dry add the yolks of 3 eggs, turn into a 
mould, which must have a very narrow rim 
and on this base of rice place the apples, and 
decorate them nicely with any kind of dried 
fruit. Boil down the juice of the apples with 
some preserved apricot, a little white wine, and 
a glass of kirsch. When about to serve pour this 
very hot over the apples, with some crushed 
macaroons scattered over them. 

GERMAN APPLE CHARLOTTE. 

Cut the crust of a crisp fresh roll into thin 
slices. Cut some of the slices with a paste 
cutter into round pieces the size of a shilling, and 
the remainder into pieces a finger in length and 
two in breadth, squaring the ends. Then take a 
round copper shape, and spread clarified butter 
all over it, and having dipped each of the round 
pieces of crust first in clarified butter, then in 
sugar, lay them at the bottom of the mould and

then the long pieces on the sides, taking care 
that the edges lap over each other so that no 
space is left between. Pare some apples, cut 
them in quarters, remove the pips, cut them in 
slices, and stew them with sugar, a little fresh 
butter, lemon peel, and two tablespoonsful of 
rum till half tender; leave them to drain on a 
sieve and boil-the strained juice with some apricot 
jam, keeping it constantly stirred ; then mix in 
the apples with it, and let all get cold ; then fill 
the shape and cover it with slices of the bread 
dipped in clarified butter and bake in a mode- 
rate oven for about an hour, and immediately 
after turn out and serve very hot. 

If preferred, instead of dipping the bread in 
sugar, strew some pounded sugar over the 
Charlotte after it leaves the oven, and pass the 
salamander over it. 

APPLES EN ROBE DE CHAMBRE. 

Take some small apples, pare and scoop them 
out, filling them with sugar, the juice and peel 
of a lemon, and a little cinnamon. Pour over 
a glass of rum and let it soak in well for three 
or four hours before cooking-. 



194 SHORTS DINNERS AT HOME. 

Make some paste with butter and cut into 
pieces large enough each to hold an apple ; then 
lay each piece on a baking tin upon the side 
where the paste is folded up. Cover with a thin 
coating of white of egg and sugar; sprinkle with 
water and bake in a quick oven. 

ROAST APPLES. 

Scoop out the centre (removing all the pips) 
and fill it up with butter, cloves, brown sugar, 
and lemon peel ; then roast them. They are 
also very nice served on croutons of bread fried 
in butter. 

APPLES IN SYRUP. 

Peel and cut the apples in quarters, taking out 
the core. Make a syrup of white sugar, cinna- 
mon, cloves, and spice, and pour over the apples 
while hot. Let it stand till cold, then heat the 
syrup again, and pour it boiling hot over the 
cold apples. Let them stand till the syrup is 
cold and thick. 

GERMAN ROLLS ("Milchbrod"). 

Stir half a pound of flour with four ounces of 
yeast and a little tepid milk into a soft mass. 



SWEETS. 195 



Then take ij lb. of flour, and a pint of milk 
with a little salt, and knead into a soft paste ; 
mix it with the above yeast and flour, and 4 
oz. butter, and work the paste very clear; form 
into rolls, lay them on a baking sheet, let them 
rise, spread over some egg (previously stirred 
clear with water), and bake in a moderate 
oven. 

AMERICAN BISCUITS. 

Take two large cups of flour, a teaspoonful of 
yeast powder, the same of salt. Mix well, 
rubbing in a lump of butter the size of an egg, 
and make into a paste with a little milk. Roll 
out once (f of an inch thick). Bake for ten or 
fourteen minutes on a buttered baking-tin in a 
quick oven. They will rise J of an inch. 

COOKIES, or SWEET BISCUITS. 

(American Receipt). 

Take two cups of flour, one of butter, one of 
sugar, and one of milk. Mix into a paste. Roll 
out once (I of an inch thick). Bake ten minutes 
in a quick oven.

SEVILLE ORANGE BISCUITS. 

Take 6 Seville oranges, boil them gently 
in soft water till tender (changing the water 
several times), then cut them in halves, and 
take out all the insides, (the outside skin is only 
to be used). Take twice their weight of sugar 
finely pounded. Pound the peel and sugar 
together into a smooth paste. Spread it very 
thin on sheets of writing paper and let it stand 
till the following day, then cut the paste into 
any shapes you like with a tin cutter. Turn 
them on another dish with a thin knife, and let 
them dry near the fire for three days. 

BOTTLED GOOSEBERRIES. 

Put the gooseberries into bottles the moment 
they are picked, leaving on both the bud at the 
top and the stalk. Cork closely. Wrap the 
bottles in hay, and put them in a pot of cold 
water, on the fire. When it boils take it off, 
but leave the bottles in the pot till the water 
cools, then bury the bottles in the ground or 
keep them in a cool place. 

N.B. — This is an excellent receipt. 



SWEETS. 197 



BOTTLED DAMSONS. 

To every lb. of fruit put J lb. of loaf sugar. 
Boil for five minutes and then pour and while 
very hot into large glass bottles. While filling 
let each bottle stand in warm w r ater (to avoid 
cracking the glass). Be careful to fill the bottles 
well. When cold the fruit will sink down, then 
cover it with salad oil, which will exclude the 
air. The mouth of the bottle must be covered 
with paper to keep out the dust..

THE HISTORY OF COACHES. 

By G. A. Thrupp. Demy 8vo, beautifully illustrated, cloth, 6s. 
" Mr Thrupp has very successfully narrated the history of coaches from a 
coach builder's point of view. But people who want to be able to distinguish 
between berlins, landaus, curricles, tilburies, broughams, phaetons, bnskas, 
stanhopes, and many more, and to know why they were called by such names, 
will find full information here. There are many pictures of all kinds, ranging 
from an Egyp tian chariot to a modern French diligence, and the text is much 
elucidated by them."— Saturday Reineiv. 

"The volume is specially interesting to coach-builders, to antiquaries, and to 
anyone who wishes to know how the world has moved in the last four or five 
thousand years."— Glasgow Herald, 

"Is an important volume, an almost exhaustive book of reference on the 
subject of coaches."— Christian World. 

" Contains much curious and interesting matter about vehicles of various kinds 
in all ages and almost all countries, and it is put into a very popular shape." 
— City Press. 

" A survey at once historical and artistic of carriages and carriage-building, 
from the dawn of history till now, ... a volume for the coach-builder in the 
first instance, is rich in rare antiquarian details, set off by curious illustrations- - 
a book of equal interest to the lover of old fashions, or the practical student of 
modern industries."— Graphic. 

"The coaching renaissance of the last few years would not have been com- 
plete without the issue of a work dealing with coaches in all ages, and so here 
we have it at last, an authentic history of the various traps in which man has 
driven since he first learned the noble art of coachmanship."— Globe. 

" Readers wishing for general or special informaiton with regard to the art of 
coach- building will do well to consult these pages. "—Pall Mall Gazette.
