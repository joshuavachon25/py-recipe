PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. 

The first edition of the MESS OFFICER'S 
ASSISTANT was prepared in the early part of 
1908, for the use of student officers taking the 
course at the Mounted Service School. This 
edition became exhausted some months ago and 
rendered a complete revision and re-setting of 
the type necessary. 

The subject matter, though not prepared for 
enlisted men, was found to be of such general in- 
terest to Instructors and Student Cooks as to 
cause part of the text to be used in our regtilar 
instruction. 

This book teaches the essential principles to 
be followed in the messing ofr troops and con- 
tains much information of interest to the officers 
rather than to the enlisted man. It should, how- 
ever, be constantly studied in connection with 
the Mess Sergeant's Handbook which contains 
much information relative to the financial hand- 
ling of the mess not heretofore published.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. 

The Second Edition having been exhausted, 
it has become necessary to print a new edition. % 

Major Holbrook, being absent in France, the new 
edition has been left to us to get out. It is the 
same as the old edition with a few minor cor- 
rections.

INTRODUCTION. 

For some years past much experimenting 
P has been carried on to determine the most suit- 

able ration for horses, cattle, hogs, sheep, poultry, 
etc., with a view to determining what food is the 
most economical, with reference to the end de- 
sired, and today, through mutual arrangements, 
between Agricultural Colleges and Commanding 
Officers of military posts, extensive experiments 
are being made on horses of entire troops and 
batteries to determine just what amounts and 
kinds of forage will produce the best results com- 
mensurate with, or regardless of, cost. 

In regard to himian dietary, much has been 
written and some experimenting has been done, 
but without doubt we have more reliable infor- 
mation as to the manner of feeding animals than 
men. Data^.^^ available covering experiments 
with a few individuals, and with small squads of 
men — soldiers, students and athletes — ^and the 
results ably analyzed by physiological experts 
show beyond a reasonable doubt that people in 



f

iv. THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

general eat too much, especially of protein foods 
— ^and that a more rational method of eating 
brings about remarkable changes in one's desire 
for food, both as regards class and quantity — ^and 
that many diseases are curable through a proper 
regulation of the diet. 

In this little book no attempt has been made 
to set forth new methods or principles, but to 
clearly announce those which we believe should 
be followed in handling the ration as now pro- 
vided. As desirable as it may be to reduce the 
consumption of food to actual requirements and 
to introduce new methods of mastication, it must 
be recognized that our men are mostly yoimg 
and hardy, and are daily subject to strenuous out- 
door exercise that enables them to consume, with 
impunity, classes and quantities of food that 
would be impossible with those whose habits are 
quite sedentary, or who have already become so 
disabled through improper- dietary habits as to 
force them to seek renewed youth and energy in 
new and well provei; methods. 
nkj^ Our rations is^based upon what men imder- 
going a considerable amount of labor actually 
consume, when they are free to choose their food 
and eat it in such quantity and manner as their 



INTRODUCTION. v. 

inclination suggests. The minimum consumed by 
such people has been considered as the least 
amount that should be supplied as a regular diet. 
Professor W. O. Atwater placed the daily re- 
quirement at 3,500 calories for a man doing 
moderate work, and at 4,500 calories for a man at 
hard work. Professor Chittenden has, how- 
ever, shown conclusively that mental and bodily 
vigor are maintained and even tend to be greatly 
increased on a much smaller quantity of food. He 
shows that the meat proteins especially should be 
reduced much below that found in the ration 
allowance, as the amount of toxins present in 
such foods are sufficient to produce injury in the 
system, while protein itself is not required in the 
quantity supplied by the articles now composing 
the ration, to replace waste and repair the muscu- 
lar tissues. 

The time is not yet ripe, however, to reduce 
our ration to the standard established by 
Professor Chittenden. The people at large will 
first have to be educated up to Scientific Nutri- 
tion, and it would be impracticable to change the 
well established habits of young and growing 
men, such as now constitute the greater part of 
the enlisted strength of the Army.

CHAPTER I. 
HISTORY OF THE RATION. 

1. The ration now supplied to the Ameri- 
can soldier is beyond doubt the most liberal is- 
sued to any Army in the worid. Congress has 
ever been most generous in its appropriations 
for subsistence, from time to time increasing the 
food values of the ration, keeping pace with the 
increased demands of the people in their more 
elaborate mode of living. 

THE RATION FROM 1775 TO 1834. 

2. In 1798 the following ration was estab- 
lished by Congress : 

Beef, \}i pounds per ration. 
Bread or flour, 18 ounces per ration. 
Salt, 4 pounds per hundred rations. 
Vinegar, 4 quarts per htindred rations. 
Soap, 4 pounds per hundred rations. 
Candles, \}i potinds per hundred rations.

/:'.• •'♦••»The5e quantities were based upon actual 
necessity and were presumed to be sufficient to 
sustain the soldier while doing arduous service 
in the field, as well as in garrison. 

3. The above ration differed from that 
authorized during the Revolutionary War, and 
for the next half century, chiefly in that liquor 
was issued at times, and certain substitutes were 
allowed for beef. The quantities of the com- 
ponents as stated above have remained practically 
unchanged to the present day. 

4. The quality of the ration then supplied 
was not satisfactory for the reason that Purchas- 
ing Agents were allowed 10 per cent, on all sav- 
ings made to the government — thus placing a 
premium on the purchase of inferior articles. 
Later the entire ration was supplied by contract 
and this was even more unsatisfactory. 

THE RATION FROM 1834 TO 1861. 

5. Although since 1818 the President has 
been authorized to make such alterations in the 
ration as due regard to the health and comfort 



HISTORY OF THE RATION. 11 

of the Army and economy required, little advan- 
tage has been taken under this authority to in- 
crease the ration, as additional Congressional 
appropriations are equally necessary. 

6. However, in 1834 the President substi- 
tuted 4 pounds of coffee and 8 pounds of sugar 
for the liquor component ^ and this was increased 
in 1838 by Act of Congress to 6 pounds of coffee 
and^ 12 pounds of sugar per 100 rations **when it 
can be done to the covenience of the Public 
Service, and when not so issued to be paid in 
money.'* This was the beginning of the now 
well established custom of making ** savings,'* 
and it has since been favorably passed upon by 
the Supreme Court. 

7. In 1860 the allowance of coffee was in- 
creased to 10 pounds and of sugar to 15, and 
prior to the Civil War the bean component was 
added. 

8. In 1861 the allowance of flour was in- 
creased to 22 ounces, and an issue of potatoes 
was authorized three times a week. The ration 
of tea was fixed as at present and allowed to be 
drawn in the place of coffee — such increase in 
the ration to be continued during the war. 



12 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT.. 



THE RATION FROM 1861 TO 1908. 

9. This ration was, however, reported up- 
on in 1864 as being in excess of the soldiers' 
needs and was reduced to that issued prior to 
1861, with the exception of 4 ounces of pepper 
per hundred rations, which was authorized in 
1863 and has continued as a part of the ration 
to the present day. Incident to this reduction 
of the ration there was a corresponding increase 
in the soldiers* pay for the reason that all savings 
then accrued to the Post and Regimental Funds 
and not to the immediate benefit of the organiza- 
tion or soldiers upon whom the saving was made. 

10. An extra allowance of one gill of whiskey 
for men undergoing hard labor or excessive fatigue 
was authorized by Act of Congress in 1819, 
and disappeared in 1878, since which time the 
issue of whiskey as a part of the ration has not 
been authorized. 

11. In 1890 one pound of fresh vegetables 
was added to the ration, and in 1899 12^ pounds 
of dried fruit for each 100 rations (later being 
reduced to 10 pounds, and by the ration authorized 
May 1, 1908, to 8 pounds.) 



HISTORY OF THE RATION. 13 

12. In 1901 the allowance of sugar was in- 
creased to 20 pounds per 100 rations. No other 
changes in the Garrison Ration occurred until 
May 1, 1908. 

KINDS OF RATIONS. 

13. Prior to 1878 there was but one ration 
for all purposes known to regtilations, although 
during the Civil War a ** Marching Ration" is 
often referred to, and consisted of salt beef or 
bacon, hard bread, coffee and sugar. 

14. The Travel Ration was established in 
1878. 

15. The Emergency Ration was established 
in 1896 and then corresponded very closely to 
the ** Haversack Ration" of today, but it was 
soon superseded by a desiccated mixture molded 
into cakes and hermetically sealed in one-poimd 
cans with a certain amount of salt, pepper and 
coffee, or chocolate. The present Emergency 
Ration consists of three cakes of chocolate to 
which a small percentage of sugar, malted milk 
and egg has been added in the process of manu- 
facture. The weight is 8 ounces and fuel value, 
about 1,300 calories. 



14 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

16. The Field Ration was established in 
1901, although prior to this time certain changes 
were made in the ** ration" for field service. 

17. The Haversack Ration was established in 
1908. (It is now called the Reserve Ration ^ and 
the former term is no longer used.) 

18. The Garrison Ration as now constituted 
was established in May, 1908, and passed to the 
cash credit basis July 1, 1910. (See Par. 4, Mess 
Sergeant's Handbook.) 

19. It is noted that in 1819 it was declared 
on the floors of Congress that the ration was 
amply sufficient — since which time it has been 
decreased by the liquor component only, while 
it has been increased by the coffee, sugar, bean, 
fresh vegetable, dried fruit, syrup, lard, butter 
and milk components, in addition to baking powder, 
various seasonings and extracts, besides substi- 
tuting turkey or chicken for beef on holidays, 
while many substitutive articles have been author- 
ized for issue when, in the opinion of the com- 
manding officer, such issue is necessary for the 
health of the troops. This elaborate ration was 
based almost entirely upon actual requirements, 
as determined from data kept for three years at 



THE HISTORY OF THE RATION. 15 

the Army Training School for Bakers and Cooks 
at Fort Riley, Kansas. The quantities of the 
various classes of foods, i. e.y meat, flour, vege- 
tables, coffee, sugar, etc., are about right for sup- 
plying a well-balanced diet (though not in all 
cases quite sufficient), and it is hoped that, since 
the garrison ration has passed to a strictly cash 
basis, it will be purchased in about the quantities 
in which it was formerly issued, and as fully ex- 
plained in the Mess Sergeant's Handbook. 



CHAPTER II. 

FOOD VALUES AND ELEMENTARY 
PRINCIPLES OF NUTRITION. 

20. It is impracticable to make more than 
the briefest mention of the Principles of Nutri- 
tion and the Nutritive Values of Food. Very- 
complete and satisfactory information on this 
subject may be secured from Bulletins Nos. 34 
and 142, U. S. Department of Agriculture upon 
which many of the following statements are 
based. * 

21. A WELL BALANCED RATION is 

one that supplies proper nourishment to the body 
without having any component greatly in excess 
of the requirements. The term is full of scien- 
tific significance but conveys little meaning to the 
average person. 

It would be impracticable to lay down a par- 
ticular diet by weights that could be said to es- 
tablish the exact amount of protein, fats, carbo- 

*See also Wiley's, "Foods and Their Adulteration." 
Hutchisons's "Foods and Dietetics," and various books on 
"Military Hygiene."

hydrates, etc., required for any particular per- 
son — ^much less for a company of soldiers whose 
habits and labors vary from those of the seden- 
tary clerk to the hard working horseshoer or the 
enthusiastic athlete. 

In general, however, it may be remarked 
that during periods of inactivity the meat com- 
ponent of the ration should be reduced, and that 
beans and heavy fruit puddings should be used 
less frequently. At such times fresh fruit and 
vegetables should constitute a relatively greater 
portion of the ration consimied, and greater care 
should be exercised in preparing and serving the 
food. Savory odors and palatable seasoning will 
stimulate the appetite and start the flow of diges- 
tive juices when the pangs of hunger are bridled 
by inaction or sedentary habits. Moreover a 
constant variety of food must be supplied at all 
times. Prisoners have been known to vomit at 
the sight of food served in the same form for 
indefinite periods. 

In regard to the company mess it may be 
said that as a rule the appetite of the average 
soldier is good and requires no special stimulus. 



18 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

« 

If the meals are. properly prepared he frequently 
takes too much food on his plate, and eats too 
fast and too much for his own good. 

22. A ONE-SIDED DIET is one in which 
one or more compounds are supplied in much 
smaller quantity than is required for proper 
nourishment. As a result the digestive organs 
are overloaded with superfluous materials in order 
to provide proper sustenance. For example, the 
vegetarian often overworks the digestive organs 
in order to provide the necessary amount of muscle 
making material. Many tribes of uncivilized 
people and certain classes of poor people are 
either underfed or are forced to eat great quanti- 
ties of a relatively plentiful article in order to 
supply the necessary nutrition, but the soldier's 
ration is selected for him, the food elements are 
presumed to be in about the proper proportions 
and generally in sufficient quantity. 

23. FOOD by definition includes all those 
substances that build up the tissues, restore waste, 
or furnish heat or energy. From 25 to 30 dif- 
ferent elements are found in the body, the most 
important being oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitro- 
gen, calcium, phosphorus and sulphur. Both 



FOOD VALUES— NUTRITION. 19 

in our bodies and in the food we eat these ele- 
ments are, however, combined into certain com- 
poimds, the most important of which are watety 
protein, fats, carbohydrates, and mineral matters. 
The body of the average man contains about 
60 per cent, of water, 18 per cent, of protein, 15 
per cent, of fats, 6 per cent, of mineral matters, 
and 1 per cent, of carbohydrates. 

24. WATER neither builds up the tissue 
nor supplies heat nor energy and hence cannot 
be termed food, though it is indispensable to 
our existence. Forty to fifty per cent, of water 
is found in the ordinary cut of beef, the quantity 
decreasing with the amount of fat present. 
Therefore a piece of meat contaiijing a good 
distribution of fat has a greater fuel value than 
an equal amount of solid lean meat. (See table 
of food values following). Fresh vegetables 
often contain from 80 per cent, to 90 per cent, 
of water, and dried seeds and cereals as low as 
from 10 per cent, to 12 per cent. These however, 
take up a large percentage of water in the pro- 
cess of cooking. 

25. PROTEIN compoimds are known as the 
muscle builders. They include: 

(a) The Albuminoids which are fotmd in 



20 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

great quantities in lean meat, whites of eggs, 
gluten of wheat, curd of milk, etc., and whose 
chief function is in building up the tissues and 
restoring waste. 

(b) The GelatinoidSy which are found in great 
quantities in the tendons, connective tissues, 
skin, etc. It is not believed that they build 
up the tissues, but rather that they protect the 
albuminoids by reason of being more readily 
transformed into heat and energy. 

{c) The Extractives, which are the most im- 
portant part of beef stock, beef extracts and beef 
tea. (See definitions.) They neither build up 
the tissues jior supply heat nor energy, but act 
rather as stimulants and appetizers. The crav- 
ing for meats, especially in the tropics, is pre- 
sumed to be largely on account of the extractives 
contained in them. 

26. FATS occur chiefly in the meats, but- 
ter, milk, cereals, and nuts. They may be con- 
sumed as fuel, but it is believed that they are 
generally stored in the body as a reserve source 
of energy to be used when the normal supply of 
ordinary fuel (the carbohydrates) is insufficient. 



FOOD VALUES— NUTRITION. 21 

Fat is the most concentrated form of body fuel, 
and its high calorific value (Par. 34) explains 
the economy of nature in storing it as a reserve 
in the body. 

The Eskimos consimie large amounts of fat 
daily for the simple reason that they require a 
great deal of body heat and nature has provided 
great quantities of it for them in the seal, walrus, 
etc. 

Soldiers serving in Alaska require more heat 
foods than others, and ' consequently the bacon 
and fresh vegetable components of the ration have 
been materially increased for this service. 

27. CARBOHYDRATES. The carbohy- 
drates are the great energy producers. If not 
required for immediate use they may be trans- 
formed into fat and remain stored in the body in 
this concentrated form until required for use. 
They are found chiefly in such vegetable foods 
as flour, rice, potatoes, etc., and in fruits, in the 
form of starch, sugar and fibers (or cellulose). 
In young vegetables these fibers are quite easy 
of digestion but if matured they appear in the 



22 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

form of toughened strings called woody fiber — 
and can be broken down only by a long process 
of cooking. If taken into the stomach while raw 
or partially cooked they are unfit for food and 
are practically indigestible. 

28. MINERAL MATTERS. Mineral in- 
gredients are found not only in the bones and 
teeth, but also in the muscles and circulation. 
They are generally supplied with the ordinary 
foods in sufficient quantity but yield little or no 
energy though like water they are necessary for 
our existence. When food, or the body, is burned 
the mineral ingredients remain as ash. 

29. REFUSE AND WASTE. That por- 
tion of the food supplied and not generally con- 
sidered as suitable to eat, or if eaten, is not di- 
gested, is termed refuse. It may include decayed 
portions of vegetables, or their husks, hulls, 
skins, etc., stones and seeds of fruits, bones of 
fish, etc., etc. The refuse frequently contains 
the same ingredients as the edible portion, but in 
such form that it may be difficult to eat, indigest- 
ible, ot* of an objectionable flavor. For these 
reasons, the value of a food to the system is not 
always accurately measured by the expressed 



POOD VALUES— NUTRITION. 23 

calorific value. Refuse should not be confused 
with waste y i. e.y with food that should generally 
be served and consumed, but which, through 
haste, carelessness, indifference or extravagance, 
finds its way to the garbage can. 

30. CONDIMENTS. The condiments (seas- 
onings) possess little actual food value, but are 
of the greatest importance in making food more 
palatable. In doing so they stimulate the flow 
of the digestive juices and by their presence 
render the food more easily and completely di- 
gested. Among the condiments, salt occupies a 
unique position in that it is the only mineral that 
has a food value. It supplies the hydrochloric 
acid without which digestion in the stomach 
could not take place. Hence it is indispensable. 

31. DOUBLE FUNCTION OF FOODS, 
Protein, fats, and carbohydrates may all be con- 
sumed to supply energy if necessary, though pro- 
tein alone can build up the tissues. Carbohy- 
drates, fats, and gelatinoids are first called upon to 
supply energy, thus protecting the muscular tis- 
sues (albuminoids) to the last Emaciated men 
and horses returning from active field serv^ice 
are familiar examples illustrating the loss of fat 



24 THE MESS OFFICER *S ASSISTANT. 

and muscular tissue consumed to furnish much 
of the heat and energy that normally would have 
been supplied by the fats and carbohydrates of a 
proper diet. 

32. BREAKFAST FOODS. Such foods 
made from wheat, com, oats, etc., are placed on 
the market in the form of *'nuts" or ** flakes" can 
have no nutritive property not found in the flour 
or meal from which they are derived, and the 
claims of the manufacturers for superior nutri- 
tion are considered more or less ridiculous. Such 
concentrated foods are generally eaten with 
great quantities of milk (or cream) and sugar, 
which add enormously to the food value of this 
part of the meal. The retail prices of specially 
prepared breakfast foods are from two to five 
times greater than those of the ordinary cereal 
products, and if the latter are properly prepared 
in cooking, evidence derived from experiments 
does not indicate any difference in the thorough- 
ness with which they are digested, nor in their 
nutritive value. It is not considered that "con- 
centrated" of "predigested" products possess 
any special advantage as a food for a healthy 
man. If specially relished they may be eaten for 



FOOD VALUEg— NUTRITION. 25 

variety, as any other palatable food, for they are 
seldom adulterated. As a matter of fact, how- 
ever, a certain amount of bulk is considered nec- 
essary for the proper peristaltic action of the in- 
testines, and it is believed that healthy digestive 
organs should perform a normal amoimt of labor, 
as well as the brain and the muscular tissue. 

33. BRAIN WORK AND ITS RELATION 
TO FOOD. While intellectual activity is some- 
what dependent upon the materials selected by 
the brain from the blood circulated through it, 
the particular substances and quantities con- 
sumed are unknown. Hence, little confidence 
should be placed in articles sold on the market as 
"Brain Foods." 

34. FUEL VALUE. The following gen- 
eral estimate has been made for the energy fur- 
nished to the body: 

Protein, fuel value, 4 calories per gram, or 
1,820 calories per pound. 

Carbohydrates, fuel value, 4 calories per gram, 
or 1,820 calories per pound. 

Fats, fuel value, 8.9 calories per gram, or 4,040 
calories per pound. 



26 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

It is an interesting fact that the energy 
given off from the body as heat when the man 
is at rest, or as heat and mechanical work to- 
gether, if he is working, exactly equals the latent 
energy of the material btimed in the body. This 
has been verified by many accurate experiments. 



TABLE OF FOOD VALUES. 

35. The table on pages 28 and 29, is of special 
interest when comparing the usefulness to the 
system of different classes of foods, or when 
determining the relative value of substitutive 
articles. For example, in order to keep down the 
expenses of a mess, and to add variety, it may 
be desirable to substitute beans for meat on cer- 
tain days. In both cases, potatoes would prob- 
ably be served, but when beans are placed on the 
bill of fare, they may not only take the place of 
meat, but also of a "second vegetable," as onions, 
tomatoes, turnips, cabbage, etc. 

Assume a mess of 100 men, and that for the 
noon meal they consume 45 pounds of solid beef, 
and as a second vegetable, 25 potmds of onions 
(See Par. 14, Mess Sergeant's Handbook.) 



FOOD VALUES— NUTRITION. 27 

From the tables of food values we note: 

46 (pounds round), x 890 (calories) =40,050 calories. 
26 (pounds onions), x 230 (calories)= 6,750 calories. 

Total 46,800 calories. 

Now substitute a mess of beans for the 
above; twenty-five pounds of beans and five 
pounds of bacon (for fat and flavor) is considered 
sufficient. 

From the tables of food values we note : 

25 (pounds beans), x 1,620 (calories) =38,000 calories. 
6 (pounds bacon), x 2,715 (calories) =13,575 calories. 

Total 61,576 calories. 

Assuming that the latter are as fully digested 
as the meat and onions, it would seem that the 
ordinary addition of from 20 to 25 pounds of 
bacon is not only unnecessary, but an expensive 
luxury. 

In the same way it may be shown that mac- 
aroni and cheese may be used as a satisfactory 
substitute for meat, and practical results bear out 
our theoretical deduction. In either case, the 
amount of protein (muscle building material) 
and of fat and carbohydrates (energy produ- 
cers) compare favorably with that found in the 
meat. In the same way we may show that fresh 
garden truck should not constitute the bulk of 
any meal, or compare the fuel value of coffee, 
cocoa, chocolate, etc.

CHAPTER III. 

ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF COOKING 
AND HANDLING FOOD. 

36. OBJECT OF COOKING. Before foods 
can be taken up and used in the system, they 
must be changed into forms more soluble than 
those in which they appear in the raw state. 

37. Fruits when ripening on the trees un- 
dergo certain changes — analogous to cooking — 
in which the component parts are transformed 
into more digestible elements. Similar changes 
may take place as a result of cooking or baking, 
or when the food is acted upon by the digestive 
juices. 

38. Food is cooked to develop certain fla- 
vors, to make it more palatable, and to kill dis- 
ease germs or parasites should they be present. 
Generally the more civilized a people the more 
advanced they are in matters pertaining to the 
preparation of food. 

39. METHODS OF COOKING. The ob- 
ject to be attained will often decide the manner 

of cooking. For example, in roasting meat we 

' 30 



ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES. 31 

desire to retain the juices within. Hence the 
meat is placed in a very hot oven, to seal the 
pores and prevent the escape of the juices, the 
oven being reduced to a lower temperature when 
the meat has been thoroughly browned. 

40. If we desire to make beef stock we first 
place the bones and fresh meat in cold water 
for some time, as the juices of the bones and 
meat are readily extracted in this manner. The 
process is hastened by the addition of a little 
salt. 

41. If a stew or pot pie is made, we wish 
to have a part of the meat juices retained in the 
meat and a part in the surrounding liquid; hence, 
we place the meat in cold water, but bring it 
to a boil as soon as possible in order to seal the 
pores after a certain amount of the juice has 
been extracted, and retain the remainder within 
the meat. 

42. If we want the best quality of boiled 
beefy we desire to retain the juices within the 
meat, and the water is made to boil briskly 
before the meat is introduced. Upon contact 
with the hot water the pores are sealed, and 
the temperature may be lowered, and the cook- 
ing continued at a simmering temperature. 



32 THE MESS OFFICERS' ASSISTANT. 

43. SIZE OF ARTICLES. The time re- 
quired for cooking any article depends upon its 
size; consequently, when several pieces of meat 
are roasted in the same pan, or when potatoes 
are baked together in the same oven, an effort 
should be made to have them of about the same 
size. 

44. REASON FOR UNIFORM TEXTURE. 
It is owing to the maintenance of an even tem- 
perature in the presence of moisture that it is 
possible to make bread, cakes, meat balls, fritters, 
etc., of the same even texture throughout, while 
a thin brown crust is formed on the surface. It 
has been shown by the use of a maximum ther- 
mometer that while the temperature of a baking 
oven is about 450 degrees Fahr., the temperature 
within a loaf of bread while baking never rises 
appreciably above 212 degrees Fahr., — the highest 
temperature of free steam. 

45. TEMPERATURE OF BAKING, ETC. 
Frequently too little attention is paid to the 
proper temperature of the oven and the general 
character of the meat or other article to be cooked. 
For example, a temperature that is exactly right 
for browning a roast would ruin a fruit cake in 
a few minutes. To properly roast an old tough 



ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES. 33 

piece of meat requires a **slow'' oven and much 
time in order to permit the heat to penetrate 
to the center and thoroughly dissolve and break 
down the tissues and thus make it *' tender", 
while a small tender piece of meat could be 
roasted in a ** quick*' oven. It is this principle 
of slow cooking in a moderately low temperature 
for a long period that renders the **Fireless 
Cookers** so much superior to anything else 
for certain kinds of work — especially that of 
cooking old tough meat until it is *'as tender as 
chicken.*' 

46. HOW TO DETERMINE THE TEM- 
PERATURE OF AN OVEN. The only prac 
tical method of getting the temperature of an 
oven is to insert the hand well into it and count 
the number of seconds that you are able to keep 
it there. (See definition of oven coimts, Par. 
391). The burning sensation experienced about 
the roots of the nails is sufficiently uniform in 
those performing the duty of a cook to render this 
a reliable method and it should be followed by 
the experienced chefos well as by the student cook. 
If the temperature of the oven is somewhat 
greater than anticipated, food will often give all 



i 



84 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

the appearances of being well done when, as a 
matter of fact, the cooking has barely begun. 
For this reason a cook should have some idea as 
to the *' times'' of cooking, as well as to oven tem-^ 
peratureSy and tables have been prepared and are. 
inserted in the Mess Sergeant's Handbook. 

47. COLD is useful in preventing fer- 
mentation and hence is a preservative of food. 
We constantly make use of this fact by placing 
butter, milk, meats, etc., in the ice box, by stor- 
ing certain vegetables and fruits in root cellar 
and pits in the groimd, in preserving yeast by 
keeping it in a cool place and in stopping the 
ftirther proving (rising) of dough when it is 
ready to bake before the oven is ready to re- 
ceive it. Fresh meat will keep better in a moder- 
ately cool, dry place than in a damp ice box at a 
much lower temperature. However, should hot 
weather require the use of the ice box, the meat 
should not come in contact with the walls nor' 
with the ice. 

48. Cold water keeps fresh vegetables from 
wilting. It quickly restores such garden truck 
as radishes, lettuce, onions, etc., that may have 
been exposed to the stm after gathering, or have 



ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES. 35 

been left in a warm temperature for a time, render- 
ing them fresh, crisp and wholesome. Potatoes 
and turnips that have been peeled must be placed 
in cold water to keep them crisp and to prevent 
them from becoming discolored and tough. 
If cooked while wilted, and discolored, they 
retain their discoloration and toughness to a con- 
siderable extent. 

49. Cold water draws out certain undesir- 
able flavors, in vegetables and certain canned 
barrelled or dried fish, or meats. The juices of 
meats and bones are readily extracted in its pres- 
ence and this process is hastened by the addition 
of a small quantity of salt. 

50. FLAVORS, ETC. Food should pos- 
sess decided flavors without being too highly 
seasoned. It should be served hot or cold as in- 
tended. Generally we like our tea, coffee, cook- 
ed vegetables, and meats served hot while we 
prefer our drinking water, butter, salads, fresh 
fruits, such garden truck as lettuce, radishes, 
and onions and many of our desserts cold. Many 
components of a meal that are luke warm instead 
of decidedly hot or cold are most unappetizing. 

' 51. The heat of cooking seems to create 



36 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

new flavors in food and to change the odor, taste 
and digestibiUty of nearly all articles of food. 
It swells and bursts the starch cells in flour, rice, 
and potatoes. It hardens the albumen of eggs, 
fish and meats, and softens the fibrous substances 
in tough meats, vegetables and fruits. It devel- 
ops new flavors in tea, coffee, roast meats, vege- 
tables, crusts of bread, baked beans, etc. 

52. Air (or the oxygen which it contains) 
plays an important part in the development of 
certain flavors. Steak broiled in the open air, 
bread toasted in the same manner and roasted 
ears of corn possess certain flavors that cannot 
be attained in any other way. 

It is also noticeable that articles of food, 
cooked in a closed oven, possess certain flavors 
that are lost if the cooking is done in the open 
air on the top of the range. 

53. Baked Apples have a particularly fine 
flavor, largely due to transformation of starch 
into sugar, and to the carmelization of the sugar 
used in baking. 

It is generally held that certain vegetables, 
such as turnips and cabbage, should be well ven- 
tilated while boiling, in order that the obnoxious 
sulfurous and other gases may escape from the 



ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES. 37 

food, and that, if this is not done, the vegetables 
will possess an inferior flavor, become discolored, 
and contain certain elements that are believed 
to be injiirious. Nevertheless, we have been 
able to boil cabbage and ttimips perfectly and 
retain the fresh color and elegant flavor by sub- 
merging them in boiling water for a half hour 
or so, according to the size. In this way, obnox- 
ious fumes do not escape, but such sulfur as is 
extracted from the vegetables remains in the 
water. 

54. WATER is a necessity in certain forms 
of cooking. For example, beans and pease 
have to absorb a great deal of water to replace 
that lost in the process of ripening, before they 
can be made into palatable food. The same may 
be said of desiccated (dried) fruits. 

55. Soft Water is used to advantage in soft- 
ening the texture of meats, in extracting the 
juices from bones and meat in the preparation of 
beef stock, and oils from tea or coffee. Dried 
beans and pease should be boiled in soft water, if 
practicable, as the lime in hard water hardens 
the albumen present, and retards softening of the 
vegetables. 



38 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

56. Hard Water, or water containing salt, 
should be used in boiling fresh pease and beans, 
in order to preserve them whole and retain their 
jtiices and flavors. 

57. In the preparation of beverages, fresh 
water should be used. It is the air and mineral 
and vegetable matters contained therein that 
render it palatable. In the process of boiling, 
the air escapes with the steam, and the mineral 
matters are precipitated to a considerable extent. 
Especially in making tea and coffee, care should 
be exercised to see that the taste is not ruined by 
continuing the boiling after the boiling point is 
reached. 

58. Should it be suspected that water con- 
tains disease germs, it should be boiled 15 to 20 
minutes before using, and if it can then be aerated 
the taste will be greatly improved. 

59. Water is said to be scalding hot at a 
temperature of about 160 degrees Fahr. This 
temperature is sufficient to bum the skin, burst 
open starch cells found in potatoes, rice, flour, 
etc., or to kill the yeast germ. 

60. Water is said to simmer when the bub- 
bles burst beneath the surface or at a tempera- 
tiu*e of about 185 degrees Fahr. 



ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES. 39 

61. It boils when the bubbles burst at the 
surface. When this point is reached, the heat 
applied to the water escapes with the steam, and 
no amount of fire will raise the temperature of 
fresh water in an open vessel above 212 degrees 
Fahr., or salt water above 224 degrees Fahr. 

62. It is a well established fact that water 
boils at lower temperatures in the higher altitudes 
on account of the diminished pressure of the 
atmosphere; and consequently it will take a 
longer time for food to cook, for, the water hold- 
ing less heat, the vegetables will be subjected to a 
lower temperature. The boiling point of fresh 
water, which is 212 degrees Fahr., at the sea level 
decreases 1 degree Fahr., for each 600 feet of 
altitude. 

It is frequently reported that beans cannot be 
cooked thoroughly in high altitudes. In our 
experience, however, we have found no difficulty 
'in cooking them in various camps at altitudes of 
ov^r 8,000 feet. If only alkali water is available 
however, much difficulty is experienced, but this 
disappears if a pinch of soda is added to the 
water. 

63. The boiling point of water may be 
.raised, by the addition of salt or sugar, or any- 



40 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

thing that increases its density, or by pressure as 
when boiling in a closed vessel. These facts are 
taken into consideration in steam cooking, in 
double boilers, in boiling meats, and in general 
cooking in the higher altitudes. 

64. DEEP LARD. The superiority of ' ' deep 
lard" in cooking lies in the fact that lard or 
drippings can be heated to such an extremely 
high temperature that certain articles can be 
thoroughly cooked without giving time for the 
grease used in frying to soak into them. Grease 
itself boils at about 565 degrees to 600 degrees 
Fahr., but these temperatures are too high for 
cooking ; the exterior of the food would be burned 
before it could be cooked through. 

65. The grease begins to smoke between 
385 degrees Fahr., and 450 degrees Fahr., and 
this is the best temperature for using it. The 
great difficulty is that so much food may be 
introduced at one time as to cool the fat and 
allow it to soak into the food before it is thor- 
oughly cooked. If this fact is borne in mind 
almost anything that can be fried at all can be 
fried in "deep lard.'* Meat balls, potato balls 
and croquettes are rolled in egg and cracker or, 
bread crumbs before frying; the egg coagulates,

and the crumbs which are held in place by it 
form a brown crust surrounding the ball and the 
grease is prevented from penetrating further. 

Com fritters contain a great many eggs and 
a nice crust is quickly formed preventing the pene- 
tration of the grease. 

66. It is noticed that as soon as the articles 
mentioned have been dropped into the grease 
which is far below its boiling point, a violent 
ebullition is observed. This is due to the escape 
of steam formed by contact of the moisture of 
the article introduced, with the hot grease. All 
articles fried in *'deep lard" vshould have as dry 
a surface as possible. If food with a damp sur- 
face is introduced, grease is apt to be thrown out 
upon the range, take fire and cause trouble. 

67. Oysters should always be fried in deep 
grease, also doughnuts and all kinds of fritters 
Saratoga chips and French fried potatoes. Sau- 
sages and hamburg steaks may be fried in this 
manner, though it requires care to keep them 
from going to pieces. Beef steaks and liver may 
be fried to perfection in deep grease, but this is 
not recommended in company kitchens as inex- 
perienced men often drop too many steaks into 
the grease at a time. If the frying in deep lard 



42 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

is properly done, there will be much less grease 
used than when it is done in the ordinary man- 
ner. Fish fries very nicely in deep lard, but 
there is the objection that the lard cannot be used 
again except for frying fish; (unless the fish be 
quite dry, and free from oil and slime,) and if 
fish is not on the bill of fare often, one would 
not care to keep a pot of lard for this purpose 
only. 

68. The flavor of articles cooked in this 
manner is determined largely by the character of 
the oil, fat, drippings, etc., that have been used. 
It is probable that anything cooked in olive oil 
would have a taste superior to that cooked in 
other oils and fats. If the fat consists entirely of 
beef suet, or suet and mutton fat, there would be 
a more or less tallowy taste left in the mouth — 
depending upon how much of the fat the food 
had been allowed to absorb. Generally speak- 
ing the flavor will improve with the proportion 
of hog fat used and if possible an attempt should 
be made to have from a third to a half of it present. 

69. FRYING IN SHALLOW LARD (or 
SAUTEING) is considered the worst form of 



ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES. 43 

cooking, though it will do well enough in camp 
and when the digestion does not demand special 
attention. Almost anything that can be fried at 
all can be fried in deep lard with less disagreeable 
smoke and a great saving of lard. Too often 
in frying in shallow lard, much fat is allowed 
to soak into the food, a part of which is fried 
until hard, crisp, and indigestible. The same 
food property cooked in *'deep lard*' would have 
a thin crust throughout. 

70. SEASONING. Cooks must not be sat- 
isfied with learning the proper proportions of 
ingredients, and think that the work is done when 
the cooking begins. Food must he properly pre- 
pared, delicately seasoned and served hot or cold as 
desired. Luke warm, ill seasoned food is un- 
palatable, and if served in a slovenly manner 
is most imappetizing. Any amount of season- 
ing at the table cannot make up for poor seas- 
oning in cooking — the same flavors cannot be 
obtained. It is the Cook who not only gets the 
proper proportions in cooking, but, who ako 
delicately seasons his food and serves it in an 
appetizing manner that should be styled a chef. 



CHAPTER IV. 

THE GARRISON RATION. 

71. GENERAL REMARKS. A proper 
handling of the garrison ration requires an in- 
timate knowledge of its composition, for the 
reason that, although it has now been placed on 
a strictly cash basis, its value is based upon the 
quantities of various articles formerly issued, 
and such quantities were determined by the neces- 
sity of providing a well-balanced diet. (See 
Par. 21.) In passing from an issue to a cash 
basis, the actual value of the garrison ration has 
been increased from one-half to one and one- 
half cents, on account of allowing credit for a 
greater proportion of bacon and jam (relatively 
expensive articles) than were generally drawn. 

In providing for our messes, we should keep 
in mind the amounts of the various components 
of the Garrison Ration and in general purchase 
about the amounts of meat, vegetables, coffee, 
etc., that were formerly issued; and imless some 

44 



\ 



THE GARRISON RATION. 45 

such system is followed, it is feared that the new 
mess officer will meet with financial surprises 
when settling his bills at the end of the month. 



COMPONENTS OF THE RATION SEPA- 
RATELY CONSIDERED. 

72. MEAT. The cash credit derived from 
the meat component, if properly handled, is suf- 
ficient to provide meat in some form for each 
meal, and still make a saving of about ten per 
cent. While there is no doubt that we generally 
consume too much meat in Army messes, it is 
still considered the basis for each meal, and if it 
cannot be provided in some form, other articles* 
rich in muscle building material and fat should 
take its place. Beans flavored with bacon and 
enriched with its fat, macaroni and cheese, and 
fish chowder are good substitutes to keep down 
the expenditure of the meat component. (See 
Par. 35.) 

73. In garrison, such variety of meats can 
be supplied from the cash credit derived from 
the meat component as to render it unnecessary, 
to serve meat in exactly the same form more 



/ 



46 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

than once a week, and few oftener.than once in 
two weeks. (See article for Bills of Fare in Mess 
Sergeant's Handbook.) Such meats as beef 
hearts, liver, sausage, pork, fish, etc., procured 
on the market, or prepared in the kitchen, are 
frequently as cheap, or cheaper than beef, con- 
sidering that bone appears in small quantity, or 
not at all, and with care in their selection and 
preparation, they will lend almost an endless 
variety in rounding out the bill of fare. The fol- 
lowing is an example of the manner in which the 
meat component may be handled. Note how the 
cost of the cheaper and more expensive meats 
are balanced, so as to provide a desired variety, 
and still not exceed the cash credit derived from 
this component. 

Example: Assume an organization of 100 
men; Commissary price of beef, 7.22 cents, bacon 
19 cents, and prevailing prices of the substitutes 
purchased as noted below : 

700 rations of beef, 875 lbs., at 7.22c per lb $ 63.17 

300 rations of bacon, 225 lbs., at 19c per lb 42.75 

$105 93

2. Spare Ribs (Dinner) 66 lbs. at 10c 6.60

Beans 26 lbs. at 6c i 2.64

8. Bacon and Beans (Dinner) Same as No. 4 2.64 

9. Bacon (Breakfast) 20 lbs. at 19c 3.80 

10. Beef Liver and (Breakfast) 22 lbs. at 6.5c 1.21 

Bacon 10 lbs. at 19c 1.90 



Total cost of substitutes for. beef $ 34.42 

Balance of cash credit on beef 71.51 



$ 106.93 



The balance of the cash credit ($71.51) is 
sufficient to purcliase 990 pounds of beef at 7.22 
cents per pound. While providing meat for one- 
third of the meals in- the ten day period, even 
when most of the meals were the heaviest of the 
day (dinner) we have expended less than one- 
third of the cash credit derived froni the meat 
component. It would seem that considerably 
less than two-thirds of 1,000 rations of beef, 
i. e.y 2-3 X 1,250 or 833 pounds should still be con- 
sumed in the ten day period, and therefore that 
even a greater saving than 990:833, or 157 
pounds of beef, at 7.22, or $11.34, should be 
saved on this component for general purchases. 



48 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

This result corresponds very closely with our 
School records, which show that we actually do 
save more than 10 per cent, on our meat com- 
ponent. In any case, a judicious substitution of 
the cheaper meats, bacon and beans, macaroni 
and cheese, fish chowder with a well seasoned 
sage dressing, etc., will provide for the purchase 
of chicken, pork or high grade fish for Simday 
dinners, and at other times. 

74. Much study must be given to the cut- 
ting up of meat so as to use it to the best advan- 
tage in the kitchen. Being supplied in bulk, it is 
necessary for the Cooks to have some knowledge 
of the proper method of cutting* it up for kitchen 
use and they should know for what purpose each 
cut is best adapted. All parts of the meat, as 
delivered, can be put to some use. Parts espe- 
cially good as roasts, if in sufficient quantities, 
should not be consumed in stews or pot-pies, nor 
should steaks be used for soup stock, but each 
part should be worked in to the best possible ad- 
vantage. The new Manual for Army Cooks gives 
instructions for handling meat that should be 
closely followed by the Cooks. 

75. Special Uses. The tougher parts of fresh 
meats, not otherwise consimied, should be 



THE GARRISON RATION. 49 

put through the grinder and used up in Hamburg 
steaks, ' Except in hot weather, corned beef 
should be regularly prepared by the Cooks and 
in Sufficient quantity for use with, or without 
cabbage, about once in ten days. Beef cheese 
should be priepared and consumed about as often. 
Sausage may be prepared to advantage in the 
kitchen whenever pork is available, and frequently 
at less than market price. All left-over meats 
should be used up in meat balls, croquettes, hash, 
etc.; and no cooked meats should be thrown 
away, except that which has been taken on the 
plate and has not been consumed. 

76. Preservation of Meats. Meats should 
not be allowed to spoil in the hands of the cook. 
Lacking facilities for its preservation while fresh, 
it.should be roasted dry, boiled, corned, or worked 
up into cheese for future use. 

77. Lean Meat. Lean meat contains a very 
high percentage of water — about half — ^and if 
fat is present, the water is proportionately less. 
Therefore, in roasting lean meat, suet should be 
added. Remember that meat is best when 
medium well done. 



60 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

78. Bacon, The best use for bacon in gar- 
rison is to give flavor to other articles and to en- 
rich them with its fat. In the ten day period 
from one to three messes of beans may be served. 
For use with them, in soups, and as seasonings, 
and for one meal during the ten day period, 
from 40 to 50 pounds would be required for 100 
men. ' 

79. Tough Steaks, Etc, Observe carefully 
the principles of cooking, as laid down in Chapter 
III. If old or tough meats have to be used, 
remember that a long period of slow cooking is 
best. For example, prepare the steaks, medium 
well done, from one to two hours before the time 
for serving and let them stand in a heated earthen 
jar (or other receptacle), either on the shelf of 
the range, or in a pan of boiling hot water, until 
meal time. All solid meats, roasted or boiled, 
might well be treated in the same manner, slicing 
them immediately before serving in order to re- 
tain the juices. So long as a temperature above 
130 degrees Fahr., is maintained, changes go on 
within the fibrous tissue and render it tender. 

All meats should be sliced in the kitchen be- 
fore serving in order that fats, gristle, and other 



THE GARRISON RATION. .61 

portions that will not be eaten if taken on the 
mens' plates, may be saved and either rendered 
out, or served in some other form. Serve all 
sliced meats on platters so that the men may help 
themselves. For the same reason, stews, and pot- 
pies, should be served in suitable eathemware 
dishes. There is sufficient in the ration to give 
the men plenty, and any tendency to take more 
on their plates than can be eaten will disappear 
under proper supervision of the Mess Sergeant. 

80. Soup Stock, Soup stock shoiild be 
made fresh every day or two. Cut the fresh 
meat into small chunks, break or saw the bones 
and place them together in cold water for several 
hotirs, if practicable, and then set oh the range 
and allow to simmer for eight or nine hours. The 
juices of the meat will be extracted in about two 
hours of simmering, and it should be removed 
from the boiler at the end of that time, in order 
that the fibers will not become hardened and in- 
digestible. (See Par. 81.) Cooked meat, . if 
used, should be added after the boiler is placed on 
the range. When prepared, strain the stock into 
earthen jars and set in a cool place. The grease 
will rise to the top and harden, and can then be 
easily removed. Clean out the stock boiler and 



62 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

start over next time with an entirely new lot of 
bones and meat. The stock is used, not only in 
making soups, but also in hash, meat balls, pot- 
pies, gravies, sauces, etc., and sometimes in ixiashed 
potatoes. 

81. Prevent Waste. No portion of the meal 
or bones should be thrown away s6 long as any 
nutriment remains in them. Remember that in 
boiling beef, only the juices are extracted, and that 
most of the nourishment remains in the meat, 
though by continued boiling, the fibers ar6 hard- 
ened and rendered less digestible. If run through 
the hash machine, the meat from the stock boiler 
can be used to advantage in hash, meat balls, 
croquettes, etc., though if used alone, it will be 
dry and tasteless, on account of the absence' of 
the extractives. 

82. Soup. A rich, well-seasoned, stock soup 
should, as a rule, form a part of the dinner each 
day. It should be served in a course by itself, 
and before the more substantial part of the dinner 
is brought on. The soup should be set out in 
covered tureens each of which should be pro- 
vided with a deep ladle, so that the men may help 
themselves. Serve plenty of croutons, or crackers 



THE GARRISON RATION. 63 

with it, and see that it is hot when served, and 
that the grease is skimmed off. In our experi- 
ence, 10 to 12 gallons is disposed of regularly 
by a company of 100 men. If the soup is served 
with the more substantial part of the meal, you 
should very properly expect the men to pass it 
by in order to get their share of the pot-pie, etc., 
and to get it while it is hot. If it is served in the 
manner indicated, there will be small loss. All 
that is left in the tureens may be saved and used 
up in some other form for supper, or other subse- 
quent meal. 

Strain the soup and save the vegetables and 
meat for hash, meat balls, etc. The stock may be 
used again in soup on the following day, or added 
to hash, gravies, etc. Especially in warm weather 
stock in which vegetables have been cooked, will 
sour in a short time and hence it must be used 
up at once. 

83. BREAD AND FLOUR. In the Train- 
ing School kitchens about 10 per cent, is saved 
from the cash credit derived from this component, 
i. e.y after purchasing the bread consumed in the 
mess and sufficient flour for all other purposes, 
about 10 per cent, is left to apply, for example, 



54 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

on breakfast fpods, which are consimied almost 
daily, but for which no cash credit is allowed. 
It is considered that not more than two-thirds 
of the credit on this component should be ex- 
pended for bread, and that if more bread is 
purchased, it must form so great a part of the 
diet that probably it is the best time on the bill 
of fare, and the mess is a poor one. If the meat 
and vegetables are well prepared, the organiza- 
tion will not begin to spend its credit from this 
component for bread, and if hot rolls, bims, bis- 
cuits, etc., are frequently made, the purchase of 
bread should decrease in proportion, as we are 
but adding variety by giving the flour to the men 
in a slightly different form. 

84. Flour is the cheapest food that can \>e 
constantly used in the kitchen, nutritive value 
and general usefulness considered. It is rich in 
muscle building material and in starch, which is 
converted into sugar and fat, and a study of the 
various methods of handling it will more than pay 
for the trouble. 

85. Bread should be purchased in small 
quantities as required, from day to day, especi- 
ally if rats and mice are nimierous, aijd a good 



THE GARRISON RATION. 55 

bread box has not yet been provided. Just .be- 
fore mess call, .it should be cut into thin .slices 
and piled closely on the plates. Toward the end 
of the meal, only small quantities should be cut, 
in order to have but few unused slices remaining. 
•Unused slices should -not be thrown away, but 
should be piled closely on the platej in the form 
of the loaf as cut, and covered with a slightly 
dampened cloth, and put away to be served first 
at the next meg-l. ..■>.'. 

86. Crumbs. Crumbs and dried pieces of 
bread, and bread that is slightly heavy' arid not 
desirable for the table, should be saved ' and 
placed in a flour sack, suspended in a dry place 
in the store room or elsewhere. ' Froin'time to 
time, they should be toasted and ground Into 
powder or fine crumbs, for use in the place of 
cracker dust, in the preparation of ineat balls, 
potato balls, croquettes, etc. The cruinbs* of 
bre^d, or good slices, may be used in the prepara- 
tion of bread pudding, in stuffiing, etc., or put 'into 
cubes, toasted and served as croutons with soup. 

• 87. Milk Toast. This is a dish that is seldom 
made, but cheap and greatly appreciated. In its 
preparation, much bread that might otherwise 



66 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

become dry or moldy is prepared in a palatable 
form. 

88. Bread and Rolls that have been dried 
out to some extent may be greatly freshened by 
moistening slightly and placing in a slow oven for 
half an hour. The moisture within the Ip^f or 
roll that has disappeared by combining with the 
cnmib, will be reconverted into steam and per- 
meate the whole, giving it the appearance of fresh 
bread. 

Observe the following methods: Place a 
moistened dish towel in the bottom of a bake pan 
and then place the rolls upon it, folding the ends 
of the towel over the tops of the rolls and sprink- 
ling lightly those exposed. Place in a slow 
oven (say 25 coimts) for about half an hour, and 
the rolls will be ready to serve. Or, place a pan 
of steaming hot water on the bottom shelf of the 
oven, and a pan of rolls on the top shelf, leaving 
the door on the second notch, to give circulation 
of steam, and re-heat as before. Or, place a pan 
of rolls in a larger pan of hot water, and cover 
the whole with another pan for about 20 minutes. 
See that the surface of the rolls is dry before 
serving. 



THE GARRISON RATION. 67 

To further use accumtilated bread crumbs, 
or to cheapen the cost of running the mess, a 
goodly proportion may be mixed in with the hash 
and all similar preparations y in Hamburg steaks, 
in pan cakes, and in fruit pudding. Flour may 
even be made to take the place of starch in sweet 
sauces, with but little detriment and little chance 
of detection. 

Soups and stews will be greatly improved 
by dropping small pieces of dough into them 
while boiling hot, about 10 minutes before serv- 
ing. 

89. Pan Cakes. In many organizations any 
attempt to serve pan cakes has been given up- 
on account of the apparent necessity of serving 
them cold. To obviate this, place a hot bake pan 
on the shelf of the range and as fast as the cakes 
are fried pile them carefully in tiers of about one 
dozen each and they will keep hot for a long 
time. Cover with a clean dish towel, also using 
one beneath the pile of cakes. 

Frequently the pan cakes that are fried first 
are tough and soggy, for the reason that griddle 
is not hot enough and as a result the batter is 
heated gradually and the gas escapes, thus render- 



58 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

ing.a cellular structure impossible. Again, the 
last cakes fried are apt to be heavy, for the reason 
that the batter has been standing in a warm room 
for some time, allowing. the gas to expand and 
escape from the batter before it is placed on the 
griddle. . 

The right way is to get the griddle hot, then 
add baking powder to a portion of the batter only 
—say one-fourth— preparing the remainder in 
similar quantities just before you are ready to 
fry it into cakes. The griddle should be smoking 
hot, and the batter just thin enough to spread 
readily to the desired thickness on the griddle. 
As soon as the bubbles begin to appear, and be- 
fore they have broken at the surface, the cakes 
shoulcj be turned back again tq finish frying 
on the side first coming in contact with the grid- 
dle. , \ , 

Batter cakes can just as well be made by 
setting a sponge (that is by using yeast), thus 
making a small saving in money and incidentally 
avoiding any difficulties met in handling baking 
powder. In addition, a small amount of baking 
powder can be added to advantage in the manner 
above indicated. 



THE GARRISON RATION. 59 

90. Hard Bread is occasionally ordered sold, 
by the Commissary, in order that a fresh supply 
may be kept in store. The small quantity pur- 
chased may easily be disposed of as follows: 
Toast into a quick oven and break into soup im- 
mediately before serving. Use it in making 
chowder. Prepare a bread and apple pudding. 
Use in making pan cakes, or any of the ways in- 
dicated for crumbs and dried bread, 

91. Corn Meal. Com meal should be used 
occasionally to break the monotony of oatmeal 
as a breakfast food. It may also be served for 
breakfast or supper in the form of mush, or com 
bread and sirup, or made into a genuine hoe 
cake. Left-over mush of any kind may be sliced 
when cold, fried and served hot with or without 
sirup. 

92. There will be an additional fimd accru- 
ing from this component, by way of a bakery 
dividend at the end of each quarter. This divi- 
dend will be small— possibly $.003 or $.004 per 
pound of bread purchased by the organization, de- 
pending upon the extra duty paid the bakers, the 
price of flour, yeast, etc., used in the bakery, 

93. Baking Powder. The allowance of bak^ 



60 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

ing powder is generally sufficient, but the amount 
to be purchased depends largely upon the amount 
of yeast used in the kitchen. The allowance will 
permit of making one component of one meal 
every day, say batter cakes, biscuits, etc. Roughly 
speaking, an estimate, of baking powder to be used 
will be about three-fourths ounce per poimd of 
flour required for the batter cakes, biscuits, etc., 
or possibly not«nore than one-half of an ounce, if 
a good baking powder, such as Royal, or Price's, 
is used. 

94. In using baking powder, remember that 
it is a mixture of an acid and an alkali, which re- 
main inert so long as they are kept perfectly dry, 
but quickly unite in the presence of water, liberat- 
ing the carbonic gas, which gives to the dough 
the porous structure. (See definitions.) The 
quantity of gas liberated by a given amount 
of any particular powder is definite, and fixed in 
quantity, and its premature escape will ruin the 
food that is being prepared, making it heavy and 
soggy. Heat hastens the formation and escape 
of the gases, therefore use cold water in the mixtures 
containing baking powder, and bake at once; or, 
until the dough prepared can be baked, it should 
be kept in a cool place. Note that the method of 



THE GARRISON RATION. 61 

handling baking powder mixtures is exactly op- 
posite to that followed when handling yeast, 
where warm water (of 80 to 90 degrees Fahr.) 
should be used, in order to facilitate the fermenta- 
tion and formation of gas, and for the same reason 
an even, warm temperature is required while the 
dough is rising. 

When using yeasty there is a continuous forma- 
tion of gas which is stopped only by killing the 
yeast germ- in the oven. With baking powder, 
there should be little evidence of its presence 
until the dough has been placed in the oven, when 
the heat causes its rapid expansion. The oven 
heat forms a crust, seals the pores, and fixes the 
framework before the gas has had an opportunity 
to escape and allow the dough to drop back to 
its former condition. It is just at this critical 
stage that a jarring of the dough may rupture the 
cells that have formed and cause the cake or other 
preparation to fall. 

95. A fairly good baking powder can be made 
as follows: Take 16 ounces of cream of tartar, 8 
ounces of baking soda and 4 ounces of corn starch, 
and mix thoroughly by putting through the sieve 
at leftst nin^ times. 



62 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

' 96. Yeast. The cook who is familiar with 
handling yeast in the kitchen has an immense 
advantage over the one who is not, and he can 
run his kitchen at a relatively lower cost, while 
setting a better table and providing a greater 
variety "of food for his men. 

The reason is this: Flour is the cheapest 
component of the ration that can be used in quan- 
tity in the kitchen, and consequently any iiicrease 
in this component over the normal amount will 
lessen the general expense of running the mess. 
Furthermore, by the use of yeast, we can supply 
every day a different variety of hot rolls or cold 
bread, in' the form of Parkerhouse Rolls, Tea Buns, 
Cinnamon Buns, Coffee Cakes, Crullers, Jenny 
Linds, etc. The men never tire of these articles, 
while baking powder biscuits, is used constantly, 
tufn against the stomachs of those men nat accus- 
tomed '• to eating them. As a consequence of 
eating more than a normal amount of the cheaper 
component, the men eat far less of the more ex- 
pensive articles. 

97. THE BEAN COMPONENT. The cash 
credit derived from tl.is component is more 
than sufficient to cover the dried vegetables 



THE GARRISON RATION. 63 

* 
that can generally be used to advantage in the 
kitchen even during the winter and eariy spring, 
considering that the beans used with bacon as 
substitute for beef are considered as bought 
from the meat credit allowance. (See Par. 35). 
The variety being served should be as great as 
possible, and not consist of the issue beans and 
rice only. 

98. Special care should be exercised to see 
that beans are thoroughly done before serving. 
They should be whole but so soft as to be easily 
mashed in the fingers. Remember that soft 
water is best, and if the water is very hard, one- 
half to one teaspoonful of soda per gallon of 
water should be added. We do not endorse the 
general method advocated for baking beans, 
"Soak all day, and boil all night," but in order 
to prevent the formation of tough, detached hulls, 
recommend that they be soaked not longer than 
from one to three hours, boiled not • longer than 
one hour, and thereafter allowed to simmer (say 
at 180 degrees Fahr.) until done. In this way, the 
hulls disappear entirely, and the beans remain 
whole, giving fine, nutty flavor. 

If beans are well cooked, they are an invalu- 
able food for the soldier while doing arduous 



64 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

service, but if not thoroughly done, they are irri- 
tating, indigestible, and productive of much intes- 
tinal disorder. If the beans or pease are ground, 
they are much more quickly prepared and are 
more readily digested. Bean and pea meal is 
strongly recommended for soups and stews in 
the field. (See Par. 100-a.) 

99. Beans, while an excellent food for the 
robust and healthy, and for persons leading an 
active life, are considered unsuitable for persons 
of sedentary habits and for the invalid and con- 
valescent. 

Beans and pease contain much muscle build- 
ing material, but are deficient in fat. With the 
designated amount of fat added, they approach 
the food value of fresh beef, though they are not 
so thoroughly digested. (See Par. 35.) 

100. For an organization of 100 men, the 
following is about the maximimi amount of dried 
vegetables that can be used to advantage in a ten 
day period, even during that portion of the year 
when fresh vegetables are not abundant. 

(a) Issue Beans, 75 pounds. This is suffi- 
cient for two messes of baked beans, one mess of 
stewed beans, and one soup. There is a general 



THE) GARRISON RATION. 65 

idea that beans cannot be baked without soaking, 
but we find that if simply placed in cold water, 
brought to a boiling point, and left at a simmering 
temperature for about ten hours, equally good re- 
sults are obtained. In cold or moderate weather, 
the beans may be soaked for five or six hours, 
though we cannot see that any great benefit re- 
sults from so doing, and in hot weather they are 
more liable to sour. 

For flavor and fat (in which beans are de- 
ficient) about 15 or 20 per cent, of sliced or diced 
bacon, ham, or salt pork, should be added before 
baking. If additional bacon is served with the 
beans, (an unnecessary extravagance) it should 
be fried or boiled, and served separately, and not 
cooked with them, as it would make them too 
greasy. Beans are cooked only fairly well in 
the type of * * fireless cooker * ' now provided. They 
must, however, generally be boiled for at least an 
hour before being placed in the cooker, and be 
carefully insulated, and even then, it is frequently 
necessary to re-heat them before serving. 

(b) Dried Pease, 20 poimds. This is suffi- 
cient for one mess of stewed pease. Add five 
potmds of diced bacon, and serve as a vegetable. 



66 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

Dried green pease (whole) are handled in exactly 
the same manner as dried beans, except that very- 
little sugar is added. They may be baked or. 
stewed. 

(c) Lima Beans, 20 pounds. This is suffi- 
cient for one mess of stewed beans. Add five 
pounds of diced bacon and serve as a vegetable. 
Lima beans break up very easily in cooking; 
therefore, as soon as they are brought to a boil, 
they should be set back on the range, or in a pan 
of boiling water, and allowed to simmer until 
well done, about two and one-half or three hours 
being required. 

(d) Kidney Beans, 15 potmds. This is suffi- 
cient for one mess of stewed beans. Add five 
pounds of diced bacon, cook over night in an 
oven and serve as a vegetable. Handled in the 
same manner as issue beans, except for season- 
ing. 

(e) Chili Beans, 25 potmds. This is suffi- 
cient for one meal of Chili con Came and one mess 
of stewed beans. To serve as a vegetable, add 
five pounds of diced bacon and cook for three 
or four hours. They are better, however, when 



THE GARRISON RATION. 67 

baked over night. Kidney beans and issue beans 
may also be used in Chili con Came. 

(f) Rice. Rice is very easy of digestion, and 
is relished by the soldier, if properly cooked, i. e., 
so that, when ready to serve, the grains are nicely 
separated from each other and so soft as to easily 
mash in the fingers. Rice is rich in starch 
and is consequently an important source of 
energy, rather than a builder of flesh and muscle. 

For one hundred men, supply about 25 
pounds for the ten day period, with the expecta- 
tion of preparing one meal of curry and rice, one 
pudding, and one mess of boiled rice, in addition 
to using it in soup. 

To boil rice, place in plenty of water — say 
four times its volimie, and let boil tmtil the rice 
can be almost mashed between the fingers, but is 
still a little stiff, say for twenty minutes. Set a 
colander on the drain board and pour the whole 
contents into it. There will be sufficient heat re- 
maining to finish the cooking, so that the grains 
may be mashed in the fingers, but are still sepa- 
rate and whole." Place in a clean receptacle and 
set in a warm place tmtil served. 



68 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

If the rice has been boiled too long, it should 
be chilled at once by placing under a cold water 
spigot, or by immersion in a vessel of cold water, 
removing at once. 

(g) Dried Sweet Corn, 15 pounds. This is 
sufficient for one mess of stewed com and one of 
soup. It takes up water very readily — ^about 
twice its weight — and can be prepared in about 
three-fourths of an hour. If, however, the com 
has been cured when nearly ripe instead of when 
in full milk it may be necessary to soak for 3 or 
4 hours and cook for the same period. 

(h) Hominy, 10 pounds. It may be served 
as a vegetable if boiled (with diced bacon added), 
or it may be boiled, and when cold, "sliced, fried, 
and served with sirrup. If milk is available, 
** Hominy and Milk" may be served. 

101. VEGETABLES. The. cash credit de- 
rived from the potato component is sufficient 
to cover the cost of all fresh vegetables required 
for the kitchen, providing that the quality is 
up to the standard, and the Commissary makes 
good all loss from decay and sprouts. Where 
a good garden is maintained, ' a considerable 
saving should be made on this component. 



THE GARRISON RATION. 69 

From 14 to 16 ounces of potatoes is sufficient 
for the daily consumption of one man. The 
onions should not exceed about 10 per cent, of 
the issue. They are used best for the purpose of 
seasoning, though they may be served to advan- 
tage as a vegetable about once in ten days. The 
same may be said of tomatoes. When fresh 
vegetables are abundant, a saving should be made 
on the potato component with a view to making 
otl^er purchases. 

102. Potatoes should be stored in a cool, 
dry place. Warmth and moisture hasten decay 
and promote the growth of sprouts. The sprouts 
should be removed as soon as they appear, as 
their growth exhausts the starch and renders the 
potato unfit for food. 

Potatoes are about two-thirds water. The 
solid matter consists mostly of starch, though 
albuminous matters and salts are present in small 
quantities. In the presence of cold water a 
portion of the starch is drawn out and settles to 
the bottom of the receptacle. 

Potatoes that have been frozen and quickly 
thawed are said to be sweeter than others. 
Frozen potatoes should be kept in this condition 



70 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

until used. To thaw them out, place in cold 
water and leave until used. 

103. After pealing, potatoes should be placed 
in cold water and allowed to remain there until 
ready to cook. If exposed to the air, they will 
become dark colored and very tough, and will 
retain these characteristics, to a certain extent, 
after cooking. 

Potatoes shoiild be boiled until the starch cells 
are broken. This requires about thirty minutes, 
depending upon their size, and this condition is 
noted by the easy penetration of the tines of a 
fork. The water should now be drawn off, and 
the potatoes should be allowed to steam for 
about five minutes with the lid off, when stiffi- 
cient water will have escaped from them to make 
them mealy. Should the water not be allowed 
to escape from them in this manner, the starch 
will absorb it, making the potato gummy. It 
is said that the longer the potato remains in a 
dry heat above 125 degrees Fahr., say up to one 
and one-half hours, the more "nutty" and sweet 
the flavor will become. 

104. For the reason stated above, the skin 
of baked potatoes should be pierced with a fork 



THE GARRISON RATION. 71 

or broken to allow much of the moisture con- 
tained within to escape. When the skins of boiled 
potatoes are broken, they will remain mealy for 
a long time if kept warm, but if skins are not 
broken, they will become soggy. Only starchy 
foods like potatoes and rice can be kept for a long 
time in this manner, without losing their color, or 
acquiring a strong flavor. 

Boiled, mashed, or baked potatoes become hard 
and gummy upon cooling, due to the absorption 
of the water by the starch from the ruptured 
cells. 



105. DEFINITIONS. 

(a) Saratoga Chips are thin slices of raw 
potatoes, fried in deep lard. 

(b) French Fried Potatoes are strips of pota- 
toes of about one-third of an inch cross section, 
cut lengthwise from the raw potatoe, and fried 
in deep lard. 

(c) German Boiled Potatoes are boiled potatoes 
cut to about the size of an egg, with a small 
amount of browned onions spread over them. 



72 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

(d) German Fried Potatoes are raw potatoes 
sliced crosswise and stewed in a closed vessel 
(or baked) in a small amount of onions, stock and 
fat. 

(e) Browned Potatoes are raw or boiled pota- 
toes, well greased and baked in a brisk oven. 
Small potatoes are frequently used up in this way, 
but all should be of about the same size. 

(i) Hashed Potatoes are chopped boiled 
potatoes, mixed with stock, placed in a well greased 
bake pan, greased well over the top, and baked 
in a brisk oven. 

(g) Chessed Potatoes are the same as hashed 
potatoes, with a small amount of grated cheese 
added. 

(h) Lyonnaise Potatoes are prepared by 
placing boiled potatoes in a bake pan, covering 
them with about one-tenth the amount of fried 
onions, spreading over with fat, and baking in a 
brisk oven. 

(i) Creamed Potatoes are prepared from raw 
potatoes, cut in small chunks, and stewed in a 
(g-eam gravy, or from boiled potatoes similarly 
prepared and covered with hot gravy. 



THE GARRISON RATION. 73 

106. All left over potatoes can be used up 
in the form of fried potatoes, in meat balls, or in 
hash. The whole potatoes may be cut up and 
used in creamed potatoes, salads and soup, in 
addition to the forms just mentioned. As a rule 
vegetables left over from any meal should be used 
up in some other form within the next twenty- 
four hours. In warm weather, they are apt to 
sour if kept for a longer period. It is a good rule 
to use up for supper all foods left over from 
breakfast and dinner. 

107. Onions and Tomatoes. Onions are most 
valuable as a seasoning for soups, stews, and 
Hamburg steaks, and in the preparation of salads, 
lyonnaise potatoes, and beef steak smothered 
with onions. Boiled Onions are a very palatable 
dish, and should be served with cream sauce. 
Onions so served are soothing to the mucous 
linings of the stomach. In any form they are 
said to possess certain medicinal properties. 

Tomatoes are used in much the same manner, 
being most valuable as a seasoning for sauces, 
although they may be served as a vegetable or a 
salad. 



74 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

108. Cabbage. In preparing cabbage for 
cooking, it should be first quartered longitudi- 
nally, and held for a few minutes with the head 
submerged in salt water, to which a little vinegar 
has been added. This will rid it of worms and 
insects. It is one of the most useful vegetables 
when properly cooked, and is invaluable in the 
fall and winter when other vegetables are scarce. 
Cabbage contains a certain amoimt of -sulfur, 
and is apt to be indigestible and produce flatu- 
lence when improperly cooked. Cut the cabbage 
crosswise in rather small chunks, and completely 
submerge while cooking. If allowed to ** steam*' 
for a long time, or if cooked longer than neces- 
saiy, it becomes discolored, tough and indigest- 
ible. It should be done in about one-half hour. 
When cooked with meat, do not add the cabbage 
until one-half hour to 40 minutes before time for 
serving. 

109. Parsnips and salsify are important 
vegetables for the company mess, as they with- 
stand the frost and may be left in the ground 
over winter, making it possible to have these 
vegetables in the spring when other vegetables 
are scarce. They should, however, be dug in 



THE GARRISON RATION. 76 

the early spring, as they otherwise will become 
fibrous and tough. 

.110. Turnips, beets and carrots , for summer 
and fall use, should be the quick growing kind, 
and should not be allowed to attain any great 
size. When grown for winter use these vege- 
tables, like others that are stored, should be- 
come well matured, as otherwise they will not 
keep. 

111. Lettuce, radishes and. onions, for use 
during the stmimer, must be planted at short 
intervals,- in order to keep the table well supplied 
with tender fresh vegetables. The more rapidly 
they grow the more tender they will be. They 
should be kept in cold water, or at least cool and 
moist, from the time they are gathered until they 
are served on the table. If these vegetables 
become wilted, they will be greatly freshened by 
a few minutes immersion in cold water. 

112. GENERAL REMARKS. All green 
vegetables should be firm and fresh when put 
on to cook. New vegetables that have lost this 
property can be made crisp in a few minutes by 
soaking in cold water. Older vegetables may re- 
qtiire hours. Potatoes that have been kept over 



76 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

tintil spring should be peeled and soaked in cold 
water before cooking. 

113. Vegetables should be placed in cold water, 
brought to a boil and cooked continuously until 
thoroughly done, but no longer. The boiling 
in the case of potatoes, turnips, beets, cauUflower, 
etc., should not be so violent as to cause them to 
fall to pieces. In practice, we seem to get equally 
good results by placing the vegetables in boiling 
water, and frequently do so as a matter of con- 
venience. 

114. During the cooking of most kinds of 
food, certain gases are developed, which, if re- 
tained in the food, give it a strong flavor and odor, 
and there is reason to believe that they are in- 
jurious. If ventilated, these gases will pass off 
in the steam, but if submerged while cooking the 
disagreeable odors are avoided as the sulfur, etc., 
is retained in the water. 

115. Overcooking changes ahd toughens the 
texture of vegetables and injures those substances 
that contribute to their flavor. Such vegetables 
are inferior in flavor and appearance, and are 
often indigestible and impalatable. 

116. DRIED FRUITS. This component 



THE GARRISON RATION. 77 

of the ration is an important one, not especially 
on account of its food value, which is relatively 
low, considering the food served, but for the 
reason that the peculiar fruit flavors do much to 
tone up and render palatable an otherwise mo- 
notonous or uninviting diet. 

117. A small amount of certain kinds of 
acids seems to be craved by the stomach, and 
fruits supply them in a very attractive manner. 
Green fruits contain a relatively large amount of 
acids, and the irritation to the linings of the 
stomach is such as to cause diarrhea and colic. 
The smaller amount supplied by ripened fruits 
is sufficient to lightly stimulate the action of 
sluggish bowels and is therefore a valuable addi- 
tion to the ration. 

118. The dried fruits issued are all easily 
prepared for the table. They are too frequer.tly 
set out in the form of a stew — this being the 
easiest way for the cook to get rid of them. Each 
can, however, be made into a very palatable 
** butter** which is greatly relished by the men. 
They can all be used as fillings to pies, in rolls, 
cobbler, bread puddings, plum duff, etc. To 
further increase the variety of the dried fruits 



78 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

a saving from the cash credit accruing from this 
component should be applied to the purchase of 
fresh fruit. 

119. All dried fruit should be washed in 
from one to three waters, to remove the sand, 
worms, etc., that may be present. They should 
then be placed in cold water and be allowed to 
soak for from one to three hours, then brought 
to a boil in the same water, and allowed to simmer 
until thoroughly- done. 

120. The following receipe for ''butter''- was 
ftimished by Major Wilkins, Subsistence Depart- 
ment. It has been tried with excellent results. 

1. Thoroughly wash the evaporated fruit. 

2. Cover with plenty of water and soak over 
night. 

3. Stew slowly until tender. 

4. Rub through a colander and add three- 
fourths of a pound of sugar to each pound of dried 
fruit originally used, also one teaspoonful of cloves 
and two of cinnamon and a little vinegar to each 
pound of dried fruit. 

121. COFFEE. Otu: coffee rations is much 
abused. It is now issued roasted and ground, 



THE GARRISON RATION. 79 

and in a wooden crate or box with paper lining. 
It quickly loses its aroma after the package is 
opened and the coffee exposed to the atmosphere. 
Upon receipt, it should be at once transferred to 
air tight cans or jars. It would, however, be far 
better to roast green coffee in small quantities, 
grinding for each meal only such amotmt as may 
be consumed at that time. Roasted and ground 
coffee is easily adulterated, but its use is gener- 
ally recommended as few Army Cooks can roast 
coffee to perfection. 

122. Remember that in making cofee, fresh 
water should be used, and under no circumstances 
either before or after the coffee is introduced should 
the water be allowed to boil so violently as to carry 
off the air it contains. With the disappearance 
of the air, the coffee becomes more or less flat 
and insipid. If the water is allowed to boil 
after the coffee is introduced, the volatile oil 
which gives it the fragrant aroma, is quickly 
dissipated and fills the room with an agreeable 
odor, but ruins the coffee. Furthermore, boiling 
of coffee for more than five minutes extracts 
the tannic acid and forms injurious compounds. 
It combines with cream or milk and forms a 
leathery, indigestible compotmd that irritates 



80 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

the membranes of the stomach . The coffee shou1 d 
not be allowed to accumulate, for more than three 
meals or be carrried over from one day to the 
next. Thereafter the first grains introduced 
supply practically nothing but color, and a bitter 
taste. 

123. For the reasons stated, it is evident 
that it is best to make cofee in a porcelain lined 
receptacle or a jar, rather than iron or tin, when 
practicable. In preparing the coffee, the boiler 
should be allowed to remain on the range until- 
the water comes to a boil ; add the coffee and set 
the boiler off, or where it will only simmer for 
a half hour or so before serving. If there is not 
sufficient time for this, the coffee may be allowed 
to boil about five minutes before setting off the 
range. 

124. Allow one pint of liquid cofee per man. 
Starting out with fresh coffee, use five ounces of 
the ground coffee per gallon of water. For the 
next meal, add to this four ounces of coffee for 
each gallon water of added, and for the next meal 
three. After having allowed the coffee to accu- 
mulate for three meals, throw it all out and 
thoroughly scour the boiler before the next meal. 



THE GARRISON RATION. 81 

If desired, the coffee may be placed in sacks 
while cooking, but it should have plenty of room 
to allow circulation of water through it. By this 
method, the boiler is kept cleaner, but it takes 
longer to extract the flavor. It is recommended 
that where practicable the coffee grains be placed 
in a open sack supported by a ring resting on lugs 
on the inside of the boiler, and that the water be 
poured through the sack at least twice. 

125. When soup is served, coffee need not 
be, though if it is, the constmiption is reduced 
about one-half, and frequently the same is ob- 
served when water is placed upon the table, for 
very often the men take coffee only because there 
is no water at hand. 

126. We recommend that coffee he served in 
porcelain lined coffee pots, so that the men may help 
themselves^ and in order that the coffee may be 
kept hot, instead of giving up the greater portion 
of the heat present to bring up the temperature 
of the heavy chinaware pitchers that are fre- 
quently used. If coffee is served in the heavy 
chinaware cups, it will generally be cold before 
the men are ready to drink it, and in addition, 



82 THE. MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

much will be served that will not be consumed 
and is consequently a dead loss, whereas if it 
had been left in the coffee pots, it could have been 
retained, and used up. at the next meal. The 
coffee allowance is sufficient for serving twice a 
day only — say by using five ounces per gall (1 
pint per man) for breakfast, and four ounces for 
each gallon of water added to that left over from 
breakfast. If tea is used for the second meal, a 
money saving is made. 

127. Coffee stimulates the nervous system 
without reaction and retards changes in tissues. 
Its effect on the digestion is the subject of much 
difference of opinion. Chicory and coffee ex- 
tracts are considered both harmless and worth- 
less. Especially in the field, the full strength of 
the coffee is desired and the so-called substitutes 
serve but to deceive the uninformed. 

128. TEA. Tea is coming more into favor 
with our men, and is now used quite generally for 
supper each day. It has practically the same 
physiological effect as coffee, but has the advan- 
tage of lightness and smallness of bulk. In pre- 
paring tea, it is best to first pour over it a small 
quantity of boiling hot water to cleanse it and 



THE GARRISON RATION. 88 

remove such, coloring matters as may be present. 
Then put the leaves in a tea basket, or muslin 
sack, in an earthenware receptacle and pour 
boiling hot water through them and allow to 
** draw '' for about five minutes before serving. If 
the leaves stand longer in the water, a bitter 
flavor is drawn out which is very objectionable. 

129. Three-fourths of an ounce per gallon 
makes a very strong tea, and one-half ounce, 
medium. Sliced lemon is said to be a good sub- 
stitute for milk in tea. It is claimed that it pre- 
vents the headache and sleeplessness to which 
many persons are subject from its use. 

130. SUGAR. Sugar may be considered a 
cheap article of diet, considering the high nutri- 
tive value, which is not generally appreciated 
as it should be. In most organizations, this com- 
ponent is hardly sufficient. Generally about 25 
per cent, more than the issue allowance is con- 
simied, although in some cases a small saving is 
made. Next to fat and oil, it furnishes the most 
complete food for heat and energy that can be 
consumed. It is a quick acting food, being readily 
absorbed into the circulation and is therefore 
especially valuable to relieve exhaustion. It is 



84 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

particularly useful for soldiers engaged in a forced 
march. 

We are of the opinion that, if sugar is placed 
on the table for general use, and extravagant 
waste prevented by the Mess Sergeant, it would 
not greatly increase the bills at the end of the 
month. If eating more than a normal amount of 
sugar, a lesser amotmt of higher priced food will 
be consumed. Granulated sugar is considered 
the best and the cheapest to use. Cut-loaf sugar 
would prove expensive in mounted commands, 
as soldiers are not slow in rewarding their favorite 
mounts with a few lumps when it can be done with 
so little effort. 

131. The men should be allowed to sweeten 
their own coffee, but the Mess Sergeant will have 
to caution them against extravagance by leaving 
tmused sugar in their cups. During the first 
week of such liberty the consimiption of sugar 
is quite large, but tmder proper supervision, it 
soon siibsides to a normal expenditure. 

132. Granulated sugar makes an excellent 
sirup for table use; it is cheaper than other 
sirups and generally better liked by the men. In 
making the sirup, take a gallon measure and put 
one quart of water in it; then add about six and 



THE GARRISON RATION. 85 

one-half pounds of sugar, and let boil for about 
fifteen minutes. If the resulting mixture is less 
than one gallon, add sufficient boiling water to 
make the full gallon and allow it to boil for a few 
minutes. For flavoring, use one-fourth pint of 
vinegar as part of the liquid added, or better 
still, use lemon instead of vinegar, and one-half 
ounce of lemon extract. Jtiices of fruits may be 
used wholly, or in part, in the place of the water. 

133. EVAPORATED MILK has been re- 
duced from the "whole milk*' and to restore it to 
its former consistency, it is necessary to add the 
same amount of water as was evaporated. For 
oat meal, two one-pound cans of evaporated milk 
in sufficient water to make a gallon of milk. In 
our experience, we favor the use of evaporated 
milk in company kitchens. It has been sterilized, 
is of uniform quality, and is well liked by the 
men. When using only the issue allowance, we 
do not attempt to put it in our coffee, but reserve 
it for puddings, sauces, cakes, etc. 

134. Powdered Milk will probably come into 
more general use, especially in the field. About 
one pound of the powdered milk per gallon of water 
is considered sufficient. 



86 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

135. CONDIMENTS OR SEASONINGS 
are not, as a rule, foods in the strictest sense of 
the term, but they are quite an essential part 
of the diet. They are important, in that they 
improve the appetite and the digestive powers, 
and are consequently more important for the 
invalid and convalescent, and those of sedentary 
habits than for the healthy person. Experiment 
shows that for the latter, unseasoned foods are 
quite as easily digested as others, though eaten 
with less relish. 

136. The allowance of seasonings is just 
about sufficient. Any excess used, or any savings 
made, will generally affect the cash account but 
little. Condiments act through the senses of smell 
and taste reflectively on the digestive organs, as 
well as locally when coming in immediate contact 
with the linings of the stomach. In either case 
the flow of the digestive juices is stimulated and 
the digestion is aided. In those particular cases 
where the linings of the stomach, intestines, etc., 
are already inflamed, high seasoning must be 
avoided. 

137. A food is but half prepared when the 
cooking is only done. It requires delicate, varied. 



THE GARRISON RATION. 87 

and well-selected seasoning to do the rest. Too 
many cooks are devoid of a keen sense of taste, 
or at least exercise little or no judgment in 
seasoning their food; they too often rely upon 
pepper and salt alone. This is just the reason 
that soups are so frequently held in disfavor in 
the service at large. The first requirement is a 
good stock; second, a varied and substantial fill- 
ing (various kinds of mixed vegetables — say 
one quart to the gallon, dried bacon, etc.) ; third, 
a palatable seasoning such as can be obtained 
from red peppers, chopped parsley, and a limited 
assortment of herbs properly applied. Varied 
and savory condiments are necessary to tone up 
an otherwise flat and insipid dish and make it 
popular and much craved by the men, instead of 
a repulsive '* dish-water" introduction to the 
meal. 

138. Sugar, though constantly used for 
seasoning, is most useful as a food. The sweeten- 
ing element is saccharin, which has no food value. 
Use one to two pounds per gallon of mixture with 
puddings, custards, and sweet doughs. For rice, 
tapioca pudding, etc., double the amounts of 
seasoning used. Generally, from three to four 



88 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

ounces per gallon of coffee is considered sufficient, 
when the coffee is sweetened in the kitchea. 

139. Salt is the only condiment actually 
necessary to health. It is probably taken in suf- 
ficient quantities in ordinary foods, but such ad- 
ditions as may be made to give an agreeable flavor 
is not injurious. In seasoning soups, three- 
fourths of an ounce of salt per gallon; for stews, 
and mashed potatoes, about one-half of an ounce 
per gallon. 

140. Bacon (or Ham) diced or sliced, can 
be used to advantage in almost any meat, fresh or 
dried vegetable component, and nothing is rel- 
ished more. Use about one pound of bacon to five 
pounds of dried vegetables, or to fifteen pounds 
of fresh vegetables. 

141. Onions, parsnips , carrots, tomatoes, sal- 
sify, etc., have a valuable place in the seasoning 
of soups, stews, etc., and are much appreciated. 
In soups we use about one quart of mixed chopped 
vegetables in addition to about two ounces of rice, 
or barley, or macaroni, etc., for each galllon of 
liquid. 

142. Pepper is stimulating when used in small 
quantities, but irritating when used to excess. 



THE GARRISON RATION. 89 

Red or Cayenne Pepper is far more wholesome 
than black or white pepper, though not com- 
monly used. In seasoning soups, use one- 
eighth of an ounce per gallon, and for stews and 
mashed vegetables, about two-thirds as much. 
Two sweet red peppers per gallon of soup is ample. 

143. Garlic is much used in small quantities 
to bring out the flavors of other condiments. For 
example, one or two of the small bulbs would be 
sufficient for eight or ten gallons of soup. 

144. Mustard, when used in small quantities, 
is good for digestion. It can be used to advan- 
tage with ham, baked beans, and other heavy- 
foods, and when such foods are served it should 
be placed on the table. 

145. Herbs, such as mint, parsley, thyme, 
bay leaves, capers, etc., are found in considerable 
variety on the market at very reasonable prices. 
They are used to great advantage in meats, stews, 
soups, chowders, and sauces. Use one bunch of 
green parsley for five gallons of soup, and in 
addition, one-half teaspoonful of dried herbs. 

146. Spices are generally used in cakes, 
and articles of food containing sugar, and some- 
times with meats, either whole, ground, or as an 



90 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

extract. Ginger is perhaps the most healthful, 
and is often used in sickness, and as a tonic in 
hot weather. The other spices are better mixed 
in small quantities, for example, using less of 
cloves and more of cinnamon, but no one spice 
greatly predominating, or in sufficient quantity 
to hide the natural flavor of the food. 

147. Flavors are all good in small quantities. 
They should not be added while the article is 
hot, as the heat wastes their strength — the aroma 
passing off with the vapors. When possible, it 
is best to use natural fruit juices. Others are 
much subject to adulteration. 

148. Lemon and Vinegar increase the solvent 
power of the gastric juice, and are useful with 
meats and vegetables that are difficult of diges- 
tion. A little vinegar or lemon juice added to 
tough meats before cooking does much to break 
down the resisting fibers. 

149. LARD, ETC. The credit allowance 
for this component is generally sufficient. If a 
standard quality of beef is supplied and the suet 
with surplus fat is carefully rendered, this with 
the trimmings of fat from roasted and boiled 
meat, and the grease skimmed from stock, soups. 



THE GARRISON RATION. 91 

and gravies, will furnish all shortenings, drip- 
pings, etc., required for kitchen use. If a pork 
carcass, or parts of a carcass, with all the natural 
fats is supplied from time to time, a corresponding 
saving should be made on this component. 

ISO. Handling the Suet. Keep a long, deep, 
narrow bake pan constantly on the range for 
a general receptacle for beef fat, etc. Each 
day place the suet and fat trimmings in the pan, 
and from time to time, as the floating grease 
gathers on the surface of gravies, soups, stews, 
etc., skim it off and transfer it to the pan. All 
fats should be trimmed from cooked meats in 
the kitchen and saved in the same manner. At 
the end of the day, the accumulated grease is 
strained off into an earthenware receptacle and 
set in a cool place. The pan is thoroughly 
cleaned and a fresh start made each day. The 
accumulation of grease, which includes all that 
collected in the kitchen, excepting lard (hog fat), 
is called drippings, and is used for general pur- 
poses — generally in deep or shallow fryings, or, 
if carefully strained, in ordinary pastry work. 
For the latter, lard is better, but the drippings 
may be used in anything that is to be eaten hot. 
On account of the relatively high melting point 



92 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

of beef fat, a slightly tallowy taste is some- 
times left in the mouth after eating cold prepara- 
tions in which the drippings or suet have been 
used. 

151. Compound. If additional shortening 
is desired, it is recommended that compound be 
purchased instead of lard (see definitions). It is 
perfectly wholesome, devoid of objectionable 
flavor, and comparatively cheap. 

152. BUTTER. If this component used is 
on the table, it can be served three of four times 
in the ten day period, besides being used sparingly 
in cooking. Note, however, that the govern- 
ment allowance is one-half ounce per man per 
day, and where individual butter plates have been 
used, many organizations have served it once 
each day, e. g., for breakfast, with hot cakes, or 
for supper, with hot rolls, with entire satisfaction. 
Many organizations prefer to save it altogether, 
and make other purchases instead. If difficulty 
is experienced in living on the straight ration, it 
is recommended that this component be saved, 
and if '* butter" is desired, oleomargarin, which 
is every bit as good, be purchased (imcolored) at 
from one-half to two-thirds the price. 



THE GARRISON RATION. 93 

153. When butter becomes lightly rancid 
it shotild be worked over in cold water, and then 
the desired amount of salt added. If but slightly 
rancid, it may be used in custards, cakes, pies, 
etc. If rather too rancid for this purpose and yet 
not very stale, it may be refreshened as follows: 
Place the butter in plenty of hot water and let it 
boil for about half an hour, set to one side and 
when the water has cooled to, say about 55 de- 
grees Fahr., the butter will have hardened on the 
surface so that it may easily be removed in the 
same manner as cakes of grease from beef stock. 

Or, the butter may be placed on the range 
and boiled until the moisture and acids have been 
evaporated, but in this case, the butter will take 
on a darker color. If heated in a steam jacket 
boiler, the removal of the moisttire and acids 
will take place at a lower temperature, and the 
butter will not become discolored. Boiled butter 
does not possess a very fine flavor, but will keep 
as long as lard under the same conditions. 

154. SIRUP. This component is provided 
in about the right proportion, but the men do not 
always like the brands generally sold at the 
Comjjii^sary, on account of their peculiar flavor; 



94 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

and a cheaper grade, either purchased on the 
market, or made from granulated sugar, is fre- 
quently more acceptable. 

155. Salads. A good potato salad (or one 
of onions, beets, or lettuce) can be used to ad- 
vantage in the company mess for the Sunday 
evening supper. After a hearty "Sunday dinner '* 
a cold supper may be prepared, and bologna, cold 
roast beef, or ham will furnish a suitable meat 
component for the meal. At other times during 
the week, as when baked beans, pease, or other 
dried vegetables are used, a piccalilli salad, hot or 
cold slaw, or other similar preparation of which 
vinegar or pickles form a part, can be used to 
advantage. On days when baked beans have 
been on the bill of fare for dinner, it is frequently 
convenient to make up a small amount of salad 
as a **side dish" for supper, by using up the left- 
over baked beans, to which have been added a 
good proportion of chopped raw onions, pickles 
and tomatoes. 

156. Dessert. To many company com- 
manders the word dessert is a synonym for lux- 
ury and useless and extravagant waste. As a 
matter of fact, the ration contains within itself 



THE GARRISON RATION. 95 

all the materials necessary for providing a dessert 
every day, and it is frequently one of the cheapest 
components of the meal. Almost anything in 
the shape of cheap cake, or rice pudding, bread 
puddings, plum duff, etc., will be greatly relished 
if a palatable sauce is provided; the sauce is to 
the dessert even more than the seasoning to other 
foods. The sauce may be as cheap, o^ as inex- 
pensive, as the cook desires to make it, and the 
entire dessert need not cost but a fraction over 
one cent, or even less than one cent, per man 
though more expensive desserts should be provided 
as often as the funds will allow. 

157. One gallon of sauce may he regarded 
as sufficient for 25 men. It can be made with 
three quarts of water, two pounds of sugar and 
one-fourth pint of vinegar, together with about 
four ounces of com starch, or five ounces of 
flour, made into a batter. Or, it m.ay be made 
richer and more finely flavored as follows: Add 
a one-pound can of evaporated milk in the place 
of one pint of water, the juice of a half-dozen 
lemons, or of four oranges, or other fruit juices, 
in the place of vinegar, one-half pound of butter, 
and after the sauce has cooled, one-half ounce of 



96 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

extract. The mixture may be given a rich color 
by the addition of a small amount of caramel- 
ized sugar. The sauce may be prepared in a 
dozen different ways and still be very inexpensive. 
In addition to the puddings and sauces, excellent 
pies may be made from the articles forming a 
part of the issue ration. Even mince meat can 
be easily prepared from the articles sold as a 
part of the garrison ration, and the dried fruit 
put out in various forms. (See Pars. 116-120). 
A palatable dessert may be served every day 
while living on the straight ration or less. 



CHAPTER V. 

MILK, CHEESE, BUTTER, LARD, COM- 
POUNDS, ETC. 

158. MILK. According to the standard 
adopted by the Department of Agriculture, Milk 
is the clean product obtained by the" complete 
milking of one or more healthy cows, properly 
fed and kept, excluding that obtained within 15 
days before and 10 days after calving, and con- 
taining not less than 8)4 per cent, of solids (pro- 
tein, sugar, and mineral matters) and in addition 
not less than 3^ per cent, of fats. It contains 
about 87 or 88 per cent, of water. 

159. There is no food that varies more in 
composition. For instance, the Holstein breed of 
cattle produces a milk with the minimum amoimt 
of fat, and the Jersey about double the amount. 
The composition of the milk of a single cow 
varies greatly from day to day on account of her 
method of feeding, and a more fixed quality of 

97 



98 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT, 

milk is obtainable from the dairy milk of the herd 
than from any one particular animal. 

160. While the milk coming from a per- 
fectly healthy and clean cow may be regarded as 
sterile, we might very properly question the 
purity of milk that comes from cows that have 
not been subjected to the tuberculin test, and 
with whose care, attendance and milking we are- 
not familiar. 

161. Disease germs may be derived from the 
animal itself on account of being diseased, or from 
unclean surroundings or carelessness in handling 
the milk. 

Germs, once finding their way into milk, 
multiply with great rapidity. They are of two 
distinct classes, those that produce or promote 
souring, and disease germs. The former are said 
to be harmless unless in such quantities as to pro- 
duce diarrh^, but owing to their presence milk 
cannot be kept for any great length of time with- 
out souring. 

162. Among the diseases known to have 
been conveyed by milk are diptheria, typhoid, 
tuberculosis and perhaps scarlatina and cholera. 



MILK, CHEESE, LARD, ETC. 99 

These germs are, however, more easily destroyed 
than the first class, and by a very simple process. 

163. Pasteurized Milk. This is milk that 
has been kept at a temperature somewhat below 
the boiling point — ^about 158 degrees Fahr. — ^for 
20 to 30 minutes. This process is such as to de- 
stroy most of the disease germs that may be present 
though it will not keep the milk from spoiling 
for more than 2 or 3 days, ulness kept below 55 
degrees Fahr. Pasteurized milk is almost as 
digestible as raw milk, but it deteriorates rapidly 
and should be used as soon as possible. 

164. Boiled Milk. The most satisfactory 
method of procedure is perhaps to boil the milk 
for a few minutes, cool quickly and strain. This 
does not alter the taste greatly, but if boiled for 
any great length of time it loses its natural flavor 
and is rendered more indigestible. 

165. Powdered or Desiccated Milk. This is 
produced by passing a thin sheet of milk between 
two heated rollers in such a way as to desiccate 
it immediately. It is then broken up into a 
fine soluble powder and only requires the addition 
of water to bring it back to the condition of 
natural milk again. This powdered form of 



100 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

milk contains all of the solids of the original milk 
in a sterile and soluble form and there can be no 
doubt but that desiccated milk will come into 
large use in the near future. 

166. Evaporated Milk is produced by evapo- 
rating a considerable portion of the water in milk. 
It contains not less than 28 per cent, of solids. 
The term Evaporated Cream is no longer in use, 
but was formerly applied to what is now known in 
the trade as evaporated milk. 

167. Condensed Milk is the same as evapo- 
rated milk, with about 40 per cent, of cane sugar 
added. 

168. Skimmed Milk is milk from which a 
portion of the fat has been removed. If the cream 
has been removed by the natural process of 
allowing it to rise, a considerable amount of fat 
still remains in the milk. If the cream is removed 
by means of a separator, little fat remains, and 
such milk should be termed *' Separator Milk." 
The chief prejudice against skimmed milk arises 
from the reason that it is frequently disposed of 
as '* whole milk,'* that is, milk from which the 
cream has not been extracted. It is still a valu- 
able food — Slacking only fat, and this may be 



MILK, CHEESE, LARD, ETC. 



101 



abtindantly supplied by other foods. Skimmed 
milk is used in great quantities as food for pigs 
and poultry. 

169. Sterilized Milk is milk that has been 
heated to the temperature of boiling water or 
higher for a length of time (say 20 minutes) 
sufficient to kill all organisms present. 

170. Cream is that portion of milk, rich in 
fat, that rises to the surface of milk on standing, 
or separated from it by centrifugal force. It con- 
tains not less than 18 per cent, of milk fat. 

171. Double Cream is a term applied to the 
thick cream that is drawn from a Separator 
nmning at a low rate of speed, in distinction from 
that extracted when the Separator is run at full 
speed. 

172. Buttermilk is the product that remains 
after the butter is removed from the milk or cream 
during the process of churning. 

1 73. CHEESE is regarded as one of the oldest 
forms of food prepared for the use of man. The 
term is applied to the solid product produced 
from milk by coagulation of the casein with 
rennet (a ferment generally 'prepared from the 
fourth stomach of calves) or with- lactic acid and 



■' ^ ' ' 












102 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

subjecting the solid product thus produced to a 
process of fermentation and ripening by the 
addition of appropriate seasoning material, sea- 
soning and subjecting to storing at a convenient 
temperature for different lengths of time. The 
ferments introduced produce certain changes in 
the material and develop an aroma and flavor 
more or less agreeable to the smell and taste. 

174. Full Cream Cheese is made from milk 
containing its full complement of cream. 

175. Cream Cheese may contain any qatm- 
tity of cream, but generally has less than the so- 
called, "Full Cream Cheese." 

176. Swiss Cheese is the term applied to 
any hard, tough cheese in which are found a large 
number of holes. When cut it makes a leathery, 
flexible slice and has more or less of the flavor 
of the genuine Swiss Cheese. 

177. Filled Cheese is a term applied to 
cheese in which the place of the natural milk fat 
is taken by fat from some other source. Neutral 
Lard is used frequently in this connection. Filled 
Cheese is a poor imitation for the reason that 
the same aroma and flavor cannot be developed 
as in cheese containing the natural milk fat. 



MILK, CHEESE, LARD, ETC. 103 

178. ' Cottage Cheese is a nutritious and pala- 
table product of home manufacturer, and is not 
suitable for keeping or transporation. It is 
generally made from sour milk in which the casein 
has coagulated by the natural formation of lactic 
acid. The sour milk is placed in a muslin bag 
and the Vhey separated by gravitation, or forced 
out by pressure. It is then salted to taste, and 
often cream is added to make it more nutritious 
and wholesojne. 

179. Limhurger Cheese is made from pure 
milk, or that from which a portion of the cream 
has been removed. The peculiar flavor and smell 
are developed largely as a result of keeping it 
stored for a period of about 6 weeks in atmos- 
phere saturated with moisture and at a low tem- 
perature. 

180. Edam Cheese is a hard, highly colored 
Cream Cheese, often covered with paraffin, manu- 
factured at a sm^all town called Edam near Amster- 
dam, Holland. 

181. Roquefort Cheese is a foreign cheese 
made from ewe's milk. 

182. Cheese has about twice the nutritive value 
of an equal weight of fresh meat. On accoimt of the 



104 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

amount of fat present, it is considered rather 
difficult of digestion for weak stomachs. The 
harder forms being more completely broken 
up in the mouth are the more digestible. It is 
probable that on account of the active ferments 
present a small quantity of cheese taken at the 
end of a meal actually assists in the digestion of 
the food already taken although more or less 
difficult of digestion itself. 

183. FATS AND OILS. All fats consist 
essentially of two distinct elements; olein and 
stearin. The former consist of the oily patt that 
may be pressed out at a moderate temperature, 
while the stearin is the part that remains and 
liquifies only at a relatively high temperature. 
Both serve important but entirely different pur- 
poses in the preparation of the various com- 
pounds put on the market as substitutes for lard 
and butter. 

184. The olein and stearin are separated 
from suet and beef fat as follows: The fat is 
melted and allowed to cool. Crystals of stearin 
quickly form and the fat is spread in flat, rectangu- 
lar slabs and wrapped in a cheese cloth of fine 
quality. These slabs are stacked in a pile several 



MILK, CHEESE, LARD, ETC. 105 

layers high and gradually subjected to great 
pressure. The oil (olein) oozes out, and finally 
the stearin is left in light, cream colored waxlike 
cakes that are brittle and easily broken in the 
fingers. 

185. The oil thus extracted retains its liquid 
form at a moderate temperature and may be used 
for illuminating or lubricating purposes; or, it 
may be used in the various lard or butter com- 
pounds put up by the packing houses. The 
stearin melts only at a relatively high tempera- 
ture, thus giving body to the fat, lard, tallow, etc., 
the quantity present determining the consistency 
of the article. By ingenious combinations ad- 
vantage is taken of the properties mentioned and 
lard and butter compounds are manufactured to 
meet the various demands of climate and season. 

186. Beef fat has a higher melting point than 
lard, and beef stearin than lard stearin. In the 
manufacture of artificial butter, we find the beef 
stearin combined with neutral lard, and the lard 
stearin with oleo oil, which is the oil pressed from 
beef fat. 

187. Tallow is simply beef or mutton fat 
rendered at a very high temperature to give a 
higher melting point. 



106 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

188. OLIVE OIL is by far the most im- 
portant of edible oils, both on account of its 
abundance and palatability, and it would be more 
commonly used in ordinary cooking except for 

the cost. It has been used since the earliest his- 

• 

torical times and was probably one of the first 
vegetable oils manufactured. By reason of its 
great value and high price it has been subject to 
systematic and extensive adulteration. Nearly 
all of the edible oils have the light amber tint 
that is characteristic of many grades of olive oil, 
and if mixed with them to such an extent thstt not 
more than 30 per cent, of the olive oil remains, 
the detection of adulteration may be extremely 
difficult. 

189. COTTONSEED OIL stands next to 
olive oil in importance as an edible oil. The im- 
mense quantity consumed can be best appreciated 
by the fact that for every pound of cotton fiber 
grown there are two pounds of seed available for 
making oil, and the greater part of it is used for 
edible purposes. 

190. The oil was formerly objected to on 
accoimt of the disagreeable odor given oflE in 



MILK, CHEESE, LARD, ETC. 107 . ^ 

cooking,. and for a bad flavor in the article cooked. 
Within the past few years these objections have 
been removed, and now an oil is placed on the 
market that is practically odorless and tasteless, 
g.nd immense quantities are used in cooking and 
baking. 

191. As in animal fats, there is a large por- 
tion called stearin, that melts at only relatively 
high temperatures, advantage of which is taken 
in^ producing oil for summer or winter use. In 
the former the stearin is left in the oil which 
will retain its liquid condition during the warm 
summer months; but for winter use, the oil is 
chilled a;nd the stearin separated by filtration. 
The oil remaining retains its liquid form at rela- 
tively low temperatures. 

192. BUTTER. As defined by the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, butter is a food product 
made exclusively from milk or cream or both, 
with or without the addition of common salt, and 
with or without the addition of coloring matter. 
It is the most easily digested of all fatty foods. 
The cream from which it is derived consists 
essentially of the fat of milk although other sub- 
stances (water, sugar, etc.) are present in con- 



108 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

siderable quantities. The globules of fat consti- 
tuting the cream are lighter than the milk and are 
separated from it either by allowing it to rise to 
the surface, or by means of a separator in which 
the separation is made by centrifugal force. In 
the latter the cream comes to the center and is 
allowed to flow off in tanks provided. 

193. If desease germs are suspected, the 
cream may be pasteurized before churning (by 
subjecting it to a temperature of about 158 de- 
grees Fahr., for about 30 minutes) but butter 
made from such cream is devoid of natural flavor. 

194. Ladled Butter is made by remixing and 
reworking different lots of butter without melting, 
so as to secure a uniform grade. 

195. Canned Butter is ordinarily put up 
when perfectly fresh in cans weighing from )4 to 
3 pounds. The cans are completely filled and her- 
metically sealed. In this condition it will retain 
its good quality for several months. It can how- 
ever be kept indefinitely by melting, boiling to 
drive off the water, straining to remove the casein 
and sealing hermetically as before. 

196. Renovated Butter is of two distinct 
classes : 



MILK, CHEESE, LARD, ETC. 109 

(a) The product obtained by melting to- 
gether and refining several different grades or 
lots of different color without the addition of any 
foreign matter, the object being to secure a high 
grade uniform product. 

(6) Reworked butter that has been impaired 
in quality and has been subjected to melting or 
other renovating process. 

197. Oleomargarin is the term applied by 
the Department of Agricultufe to all butter sub- 
stitutes placed on the market regardless of their 
composition. In its manufacture the oil is churned 
with a certain amount of milk, or cream, or 
with both or with creamery butter, in order to 
secure the desired flavor. The amount of stearin 
added is determined by the climate in which the 
butter is to be used or by season of the year. 

198. LARD. Lard is defined as the fat of 
swine. From the several parts of the carcass 
distinct grades are obtained, differing slightly in 
chemical composition and ability to withstand 
heat without, passing into a liquid form. Thus 
the part that forms in large leaves, and lines the 
back of the hog, and is called ''Leaf Lardy'* is the 



110 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

best and most expensive. The intestinal . lard, 
foiind within the abdomen and attached to the 
intestines, is also a very high grade of lard. The 
*'Back Fat" is next and constitutes the greater 
part of the lard placed on the market. ** Silver 
Leaf Brand" and *' Shield Brand" are among the 
names under which it is sold, although these 
brands contain no "leaf lard" at all. Lower 
grades are found in the feet and other parts of the 
hog, but this is not rendered into cooking lard. In 
the packing houses the fat of diseased hogs that 
die in human food is rendered into soap grease, 
lubricating oils, fertilizers, etc. 

199. The proportion of stearin in lard deter- 
mines its melting point. Lard with a high 
melting point is specially desired for summer use, 
and that with a low melting point for cold climates 
and for winter use. The melting point may 
be regulated by increasing or reducing the 
amount of stearin used, though any change in the 
natural proportion must be considered as an adult- 
eration. 

200. Neutral Lard is made from the "leaf 
lard," being that portion that is rendered at a 
relatively low temperature, so that it may be en- 
tirely free from a steam taste. It is practically 



MILK, CHEESE, LARD, ETC. Ill 

free from moisture and acids and hence its name. 
It is used largely in the manufacture of oleo- 
margarin of the best quality. 

201. Leaf Lard consists properly of all the 
lard from the leaf, but there is relatively little of 
this placed on the market. It demands a high 
price and few can afford to use it. 

202. Noodle Lard is made from the hog 
backs. The lard is ground and rendered at a low 
temperature and used in the manufacture of arti- 
ficial butter. 

203. Prime Steam Lard is made from fat 
from all parts of the carcass and rendered by the 
application of live steam. It practically repre- 
sents the average fat from the whole animal. 

204. Kettle Rendered Lard consists of part 
leaf lard and hack fat only and as a rule is a higher 
grade than the steam rendered lard. The two 
grades — Prime Steam Lard and Kettle Rendered 
Lard — constitute the greater portion of the pure 
lard placed on the market. 

205. Adulteration. Beef fat has a higher 
melting point than lard, and cotton seed oil a 
much lower and by a happy combination a com- 
pound containing no lard at all can be formed 



112 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

having the same melting point as any grade of 
lard. The principal adulteration to which lard 
has been subjected has been by the addition of 
such a compound of the same melting point. The 
law now forbids its sale on the market as lardy or 
without giving its composition. 

206. The Lard Compounds consist very 
largely of cottonseed oil to which stearin is added 
to give a body and to raise the melting point. 
Some of these compoimds contain as high as 75 
per cent, of cotton seed oil and 25 per cent, of 
stearin, and are placed on the market at a lower 
price, furnishing an excellent substitute at a 
reasonable price. For some purposes these sub- 
stitutes are almost as good as pure lard, but in 
pastries about one-iifth more has to be used to 
secure the same result, and for this reason, econ- 
omy does not always result from its use. 

207. The Objections raised to the use of 
artifidal butter and the so-called lard compounds 
are more on the grounds of fraud and deception 
than of nutritive value. The compounds are 
wholesome and digestible. Artificial butter differs 
from creamery butter principally by the ab- 
sence of certain acids. In the lard compoimds 



MILK, CHEESE, LARD. ETC. 113 

a pure vegetable oil has been substituted (at least 
in part) for the animal oil which has been re- 
moved. 

208. Practically all fats are the same and 
do the same work in. the system, though their 
flavor and appearance have much to do with our 
estimation of their value as foods. We cannot 
consistently object to the use of artificial butter 
on the groimd that it contains animal fat, for we 
eat quantities of that every day. The objection 
naturally arises from doubt as to cleanliness in 
manufacture and as to the actual composition. 

209. A personal inspection of the packing 
house methods of today would satisfy the most 
skeptical that artificial butter is niade from clean 
animal fats and that it is put up under far more 
sanitary conditions than generally exist in the ^ 
coimtry dairy or in the creamery. In addition, 
the danger from tubercular germs which are 
known to frequently exist in butter is practically 
done away with. 

211. The cheapness and excellent quality of 
artificial butter found on the market recommends 
its use in the company kitchen, though the tax of 
10 cents per pound imposed on that which is 
colored should exclude that partictilar article. 



CHAPTER VI. 

PRESERVATION OF FOOD — BACTERIA 

AND MOLD. 

BACTERIA, 

212. General Remarks. It may be said that 
the deterioration cf fopds through puterfaction, 
decay, souring, etc., is due to the growth of 
bacteria* and that preservation requires conditions 
unfavorable to such growth. Thus, a certain 
amount of moisture — 35 per cent, to 40 per cent. 
— is required for the growth of bacteria, and 
generally the lower the temperature until the 
freezing point is reached, the slower will such 
growth take place. Hence dryness and cold re- 

♦Bacteria, yeasts and molds comprise a series of plants 
commonly known as micro-organisms, or more popularly as 
microbes. The general rotting of fruit, decay of meat, souring 
of milk, and similar phenomena are incident to the growth of 
such plants. Molds are fungi of considerable size, easily 
visible to the naked eye and of thread-like formation. Yeasts 
develop by a process of buddinii, each little cell being said to 
reproduce itself every three or four hours. Bacteria are 
smaller plants that multiply by a process of splitting into 
rod-like or spiral bodies. 

114 



PRESERVATION OF FOODS. 115 

tard decay, but absolute prevention of deteriora- 
tion requires that all bacteria present be killed 
and that others be prevented f roni coming in con- 
tact with the food. To kill the bacteria requires 
a sufficiently high temperature to materially alter 
the flavor of the food, or even cook it, and germs 
cannot readily be killed in any otherway without 
spoiling the food. 

As bacteria are found everywhere in the air, 
water, or earth, it is not always easy to keep them 
from food, even after they have been gotten rid 
of. It thus appears that freshly cooked food in 
general is apt to be freer from bacteria than food 
that has not been cooked, or that has not been 
properly portected if *'left over" for some subse- 
quent meal. 

213. Presence of bacteria not always un- • 
desirable. Comparatively few bacteria are harm- 
ful and some are not even undesirable. For 
instance, alcohol and vinegar are direct results 
of bacterial growth, while the flavors of butter 
and cheese are largely due to the growth of bac- 
teria. Sauerkraut is a wholesome food which de- 
rives its characteristic flavor from partial de- 
composition of the cabbage incident to fermenta- 
tion during the process of curing. The souring 



116 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

of milk is a natural process due to the growth of 
certain germs in the milk and it is doubtful 
whether the wholesomeness of the milk is thereby 
impaired, though it becomes less palatable. If 
not permitted to sour, certain putrefactive changes 
would soon take place, producing a more or less 
dangerous product. However, it is generally 
desirable to retard the growth of bacteria in order 
to preserve our food products from d^cay and 
this can be done in various ways. 

214. Drying. It has already been noted 
that a considerable amount of moisture is neces- 
sary for bacterial growth (Par. 212); hence the 
absence of moisture will check it. For example, 
in nature, grains dry out and are thus preserved 
as seed for the subsequent year, and incidentally 
flour containing moisture to the extent ordinarily 
found in wheat is free from bacterial growth. 
Meats stripped from carcasses of slaughtered 
animals and dried in the sun will keep for almost 
indefinite periods. Fruits dried in the sim, or by 
artificial means, are free from decay so long as 
they are kept dry. Crackers, which contain 
practically no moisture, keep indefinitely so long 
as they are perfectly dry; while fresh bread, 
which contains a certain amoimt of moisture will 



PRESERVATION OF FOODS, 117 

spoil in days, or weeks, depending upon the 
amount of moisture contained in it, and in the 
atmosphere where stored. Dried or toasted 
bread crumbs keep indefinitely in a perfectly dry 
atmosphere, if protected from mice and insects. 
They should be suspended in a clean flour sack 
until used. The preparation of milk for preser- 
vation for indefinite periods is a powdered con- 
dition, and the desiccation of eggs are growing 
industries. 

Fresh Meat hung in a moderately cool dry 
place — say 60 degrees Fahr. — will keep longer 
than in a damp ice box at 50 or even 40 degrees 
Fahr., a fact that can frequently be put to use in 
company kitchens. At the Training School, meat 
is seldom hung in an ice box, even in summer, but 
is protected from flies by cloths, and hung in a 
moderately cool place, in a draught if practicable. 

Dried fish, ham, bacon, dried beef, etc., are 
samples of meats preserved by dryness, though 
the brine in which they may have been cured, the 
smoke from burning wood, and additional salt 
have all assisted in their preservation. 

Most vegetables and fruits are now preserved 
by desiccating either by the application of heat, 
which drives off the volatile oils, that give 



118 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

fruits their peculiar flavor, or by a more recent 
process of passing air from which moisture has 
been extracted, over the surface of the same. It 
is claimed for this latter process that the natural 
flavors are retained, and actual experience has 
shown it to be the case in many vegetables and 
fruits. 

215. Cold Storage. As bacterial growth is 
checked by low temperatures, cold storage affords 
a ready means of temporary preservation of 
foods for periods depending upon the tempera- 
ture used. Generally, however, all products that 
have been long in cold storage quickly deteriorate 
when removed therefrom and hence should be 
consimied as soon thereafter as practicable. In 
the Artie regions steaks from the mammoth thous- 
ands of years in the ice are said to have been 
eaten with relish. As a rule, beef, is ''aged** at 
temperatures somewhat above freezing, for weeks 
before it is considered to be of sufficiently fine 
flavor for high class trade. 

216. Storing in Pits. Should it be desir- 
able to keep apples or vegetables far into the 
winter and suitable cold storage is not available, 
excellent results may be secured by covering such 



PRESERVATION OF FOODS. 119 



products in the earth. Dig pits of suitable size — 
say three feet deep and about four feet wide 
and of a length required for the quantity to be 
stored. Let the ground chill thoroughly close to 
the freezing point, and meanwhile keep the 
apples, etc., in the vicinity covered with hay. 
While the temperature is nearly down to freezing, 
line the pit with hay and carefully lay away the 
apples, etc., without bruising, and gradually cover 
with hay as the weather gets colder. Finally, 
lay boards or timbers over the pit and cover well 
with hay and earth, leaving a small flue for venti- 
lation. If cared for in this manner, apples, cab- 
bage, etc., can be kept for several months with 
but slight loss. 

It is practically impossible to keep other 
vegetables than sweet potatoes for long periods, 
in the steam heated basements of modem bar- 
racks. Sweet potatoes keep best at a temper- 
ature of 70 degrees Fahr., and should be covered 
with sand if practicable. 

217. Other means for preserving food pro- 
ducts. A cool, dry cellar comes next to cold 
storage. Its value, however, depends upon uni- 
form temperature and a dry atmosphere. Un- 



120 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

slacked lime may have to be resorted to to pre- 
serve dryness, and ventilation is always a neces- 
sity. 

The fireles cooker principle can often be re- 
sorted to for the preservation of foods that have 
already^ been chilled. Compressed yeast (not 
dried, but well chilled) have been kept for nine 
days in excellent condition, simply by wrapping 
in a number of layers of coarse paper, and then 
setting in a temperature of 70 to 90 degrees Fahr. 
Moist sacks placed around receptacles contain- 
ing food, or solid damp earth packed about the 
same, cold springs, etc., have often been resorted 
to for the preservation of milk, butter, eggs, etc. 

218. Chemical Preservatives. Before the pas- 
sage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, many 
** preservatives" were used to prevent bacterial 
growth. Such, for instance, were borax, ben- 
zoic acid, salicylic acid, and formalin, and while 
acting as antiseptics, were practically harmless 
so long as taken in small quantities. They were 
sold under the head of preservatives, antifer- 
mentine, freezine, etc., and were frequently used 
in the home. The principal difficulty seems to 
have been to determine how many parties had 



PRESERVATION OF FOODS. 121 

added the preservative as it passed from the 
manufacturer, through dealers, to the consumer. 
Due to the Pure Food Law making the use of 
such preservatives illegal, the food on our market 
is now practically free from them, although 
benzoic acid is still allowed in certain foods. 

219. Non-Poisonous Preservatives. Some ma- 
terials in common use for preserving purposes are 
not only harmless, but actually beneficial. 

(a) Sugar has an exceedingly high nutritive 
value and is a natural preservative when used in 
sufficient quantities, i. e., in quantities frequently 
as high as 40 to 50 per cent. Its use in the prepa- 
ration of jellies, preserves, marmalades, etc., is 
almost universal. Fresh fish is sometimes rubbed 
with sugar, and condensed milk is preserved by 
the addition of 30 to 40 per cent, of it. Raisins, 
figs, currants and prunes are preserved partly 
with sugar, and partly through drying out. 

The spread of the canning industry has 
however, reduced the use of sugar to a consider- 
able extent. 

(b) Salt is the most common form of harm- 
less preservatives. Its use in connection with 



122 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

fish, fat pork, beef, etc., is well known. With 
sugar and saltpetre, it is frequently used in a 
brine for coming meats, or curing them prepara- 
tory to other processes necessary in preparing 
them for the market. Salt is used to preserve as 
well as to flavor butter and cheese, and the latter 
is frequently rubbed with it to prevent bacterial 
growth. 

(c) Vinegar is commonly used in the prepara- 
tion and preservation of all kinds of pickles and in 
certain sausages and mince meats, etc. The 
acids formed in the souring of cabbage out of 
which sauerkraut is made preserves that product 
from the action of undesirable bacteria. 

(d) Spices are recognized as more or less 
efficient as antiseptics. The preservation of 
mincemeat, sausage, salads, etc., is largely due 
to their presence, although they also add a desir- 
able flavor. Such mixtures are, however, made 
most frequently in cold weather, when deteriora- 
tion is more easily prevented. 

220. Canning. By the above simple methods 
of preservation, foods lose their characteristic 
flavors; frequently they become much less di- 
gestible, and as a rule deterioration is only 



PRESERVATION OF FOODS. 123 

delayed. The only way of securing perfect pre- 
servation is by killing all the bacteria present 
(and they are always present in raw foods), and 
then absolutely preventing their re-entrance. The 
first requirement is accomplished satisfactorily 
in many foods by boiling for certain periods, 
sometimes under pressure to produce such higher 
temperature as has been found necessary from ex- 
perience. Thus, most fruits and vegetables, cer- 
tain kinds of fish, and some sea foods are among 
the products that can be actually cooked to ad- 
vantage for the purpose of preservation; but 
other foods, as raisins, currants, some cured 
meats, and cereals that are easily dried can 
neither be satisfactorily nor economically handled 
in this manner. 

Having gotten rid of the bacteria, it is neces- 
sary to keep them out by hermetically sealing the 
receptacle in which the food is placed. In the 
case of jellies, melted paraffin is generally poured 
over the surface; in the household, glass jars with 
suitable tops and rubber bands, are used to ad- 
vantage, although frequently the rubbers and 
covers are not sufficiently sterilized and serve to 
re-introduce bacteria. In the laboratory and 



124 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

sometimes in the household small amounts of food 
are placed in glass bottles or small jars with mouths 
stopped with cotton, which is said to actually 
prevent the entrance of bacteria. 

•For the general trade, however, sealing in 
tin cans is resorted to almost to an incredible ex- 
tent, and there seems to be no reason why the 
food hermetically sealed in them should not keep 
indefinitely. Generally, after the cans are filled 
and sealed, a puncture is hiade for the escape of 
steam when the cans are reheated. A drop of 
solder then closes the hole and frequently this 
work is done in a vacuum, in order that the air 
may be effectively withdrawn from the can before 
closing. 

MOLDS, 

221. General Remarks. Molds develop from 
spores found floating about in the air. These 
spores are slightly heavier than air, and gradually 
settle to the floor or light upon objects such as 
exposed foods, damp boards, leather goods, etc., 
where, according to the species, of which there 
are many, coarse or fine thread-like growths of 
various colors develop. Sweeping, dusting, or 



PRESERVATION OF FOODS. 125 

simply passing through a room stirs up mold 
spores that have settled to rest, but the simple 
covering of food is frequently sufficient protection 
from them, though this would not protect from 
bacteria. The latter, however, require much 
moisture for their growth, while molds develop 
where but a small percentage may be present. 

222. Jelly, in which the spores have been 
killed, is protected from mold by pouring melted 
paraffin over the top. In cooling, it effectually 
seals the surface against exposure to|the air. A 
little alcohol, brandy, or white^of eggs might be 
used in place of the paraffin, with a clean piece 
of paper cut to fit the glass pressed down upon the 
surface of the jelly. 

223. Sausage, packed in a jar is frequently 
sealed by pouring melted lard over the surface. 
It forms a solid cake and prevents the entrance of 
molds. Even after such precautions, however, 
food should be set in a dry place, as absolute 
sealing is difficult, and mold will not develop where 
it is dry. 

224. Canned Goods that have been opened 
^nd exposed to the air will surely mold in a few 



126 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

days at most if subjected to conditions favorable 
to such growth. Boiling and resealing alone will 
again prevent them from spoiling. 

225. Almost any foods found in our store- 
rooms are subject to the growth of molds. Even 
pickles will support such growth, though the dcid 
present would generally prevent the development 
of bacteria. Molds feed upon rich foods, and will 
not develop where minerals only are present. 
Their growth, however, may be luxuriant upon 
any vegetable product such as stumps, planks, 
and stalks of grain. In fact, the musty smell of 
hay, grain, or of the air in a close, damp room, 
is due to the growth of some species of mold. 

226. Efect of Mold Growth. The presence 
of mold causes food to become unsightly. The 
flavor is impaired or ruined and a musty odor is 
frequently present. After much growth of mold 
the decay of food takes place on account of changes 
incident to its growth. Incidentally, bacteria 
growth is more than likely to have set up and in 
part caused the deterioration of the food. 

227. Mold Not Unwholesome, Mold is not 



PRESERVATION OF FOODS. 127 

considered as necessarily unwholesome, in itself 
in fact certain kinds of cheese, as Roquefort 
derive much of their flavor from the mold present. 
If consumed in large quantity, slightly poisionous 
effects may be produced. Molds not being neces- 
sarily unhealthful, foods in which they appear 
need not become a total loss, but the mold may 
be cut from portions of the ham, bacon, cheese, 
bread, fruits, etc., upon which it appears. 

228. Efect of Moisture. Molds develop best 
in close, dark and slightly moist atmosphere, with 
a temperature anywhere between 40 to 100 
degrees Fahr., different species growing best at 
different temperatures. 

229. • Mold develops best in cozy comers 
and close atmosphere, and hence where single 
pieces of bread or fruit, stored on a shelf, re- 
main free from mold, a stack of bread, or a platter 
of fruit, will mold with facility. Many materials 
contain sufficient moisture within themselves to 
support the growth of molds, should the germs 
gain entrance; hence, precautions against the 
molding of such foods may simple retard their 
growth. 



128 THE MESS M^PlCER'S ASSISTANT. 

Mold starting in a barrel of apples quickly 
goes through the entire lot, or if a start is made 
in a bin of vegetables, the mold will quickly 
spread to all parts; hence, in storing they should 
be separated if practicable by papers, or sawdust, 
or divided into small lots. 

230. From the principles applied, it will be 
seen that mold can be effectulaly prevented only 
by placing food in dry atmosphere and if the 
room be light and well ventilated, so much the 
better. 

Remember, however, that foods just removed 
from cold storage quickly condense moisture 
over their surfaces and for this reason may mold 
when similar articles that have not been chilled 
will not. 

231. Mold may be prevented from spreading 
by wiping the individual articles such as apples, 
oranges, lemons, etc., as dry as possible, wrapping 
in dry paper, which of itself will absorb more 
mositure from the surface of the fruit, and then 
placing in a moderately dry atmosphere. 

Almost all objects resulting from organic 
growth, such as cloth, and leather goods, as well 



PRESERVATION OF FOODS. 129 

as food products, are subject to molding, and 
the only effectual remedy is storage in a dry 

Especially in the tropics can jmuch food and 
property be protected from mold by carefully 
wrapping in dry paper or storage in dry paper 
sacks.

food that should have been served in some form

242. * * * The present cash value of the 
garrison ration, i. e,, of the food provided for one 
man for one day, is, at most posts, somewhat less 
than twenty-five cents. Many people think it 
impossible for the soldier to be well fed on this 
small amotmt, while others asstmie that he lives 
on hash and stews, supplemented by purchases 
made at the fexchange from his own pocket. 
Such persons have not considered the additional 
expenses of feeding the soldier that must be 
taken into account. For the sake of comparison 
with the cost of living in a restaurant in civil 
Ufe, let us take the cash value (or first cost) of 
the soldier's ration; add a resonable amount to 
the wholesale price, at which the ration was 
purchased, add the cost of transportation from 
the place of purchase to the Army Post; allow 
suitable wages for the cooks, dish-washers, waiters, 
cashier, and general manager; and to this add 
the cost of fuel, lights, rent, breakage, general 
upkeep of equipment; and then a suitable profit 
for the business, and you will suddenly find 
that the soldier's mess might better be com- 
pared with a restaurant where the charges are

about 75 or 80 cents per day, or at least $18.00 
to $20.00 per month * * * * 

243. * * * Though savings, as such, are no 
longer made (See Pars. 1-5, Mess Sergeant's 
Handbook) the history of their development and 
use is still of interest, inasmuch as. the cash credit 
accruing from any component should, in general, 
be used for the purchase of other articles of the 
same class. The making of savings sprang up 
back in the 30's, when the coffee and sugar com- 
ponents were substituted for the liquor then 
issued. The regulations provided that when the 
issue of coffee and sugar was not actually made, 
its equivalent in money should be paid. The 
scope of the savings clause gradually spread to 
other articles, until 1908, when a saving was au- 
thorized on all of the components of the ration. 
The object of the saving has not generally been 
well understood nor appreciated; too often, it has 
been presumed that savings were made only 
with a view to purchasing luxuries for the table, 
and this idea seems to be the one firmly imbeded 
in the minds of many of our Congressmen who 
have suggested making a reduction in the ration, 
inasmuch as the quantities authorized seemed 



EXTRACTS FROM LECTURES. 135 

to be above the requirements since savings 
could be made and spent for luxuries. Nothing 
could be farther from the truth. For example, 
take the flour ration: Eighteen ounces is the 
ration of bread or flour. A well fed organization 
will not generally spend more than from one- 
half to two-thirds of the cash credit accruing 
from the flour component for bread, and hence 
the acomiulation of a considerable saving on 
this component of the ration should result. Now, 
our records at the Training School show that 
almost the entire saving is spent for flour, and 
the other necessary ingredients with which to 
make rolls, buns, coffee cake, batter cakes, des- 
serts, etc., and that the net saving — about one- 
tenth — is insufficient to purchase more than one- 
half of the oatmeal or other cereal, served for 
breakfast, but not provided as a part of the 
ration. 

Next in order comes the meat component. 
At this station, we make an enormous saving on 
beef, fully two-fifths of the issue, and why? Not 
to buy luxuries, but to vary the monotony of a 
steady beef diet by providing each day something 
different — sausage, liver, fish, beef hearts, chicken, 
eggs, macroni and cheese, etc., none of which 



136 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

are a regular issue. (See Par. 8, Mess Sergeant's 
Handbook). Later I will explain the handling 
of this component in detail to show that there is 
economy in making such a saving and spending 
it to provide variety, but not for the purchase of 
luxuries for the mess. 

In the same manner, we may go on with the 
other articles of the ration, and show that a sav- 
ing of the cash credit accruing from the potato 
component enables us to purchase cabbage, tur- 
nips, carrots, parsnips, and sweet potatoes, but 
that if such a saving and purchase were not 
made, the authorized issue of the components 
would from necessity be almost entirely con- 
sumed. The same may be said of the dried 
fruit, making purchase of fresh fruit when in 
season and reasonable; of issue beans, purchasing 
lima beans, chili beans, dried sweet com, pease; 
of coffee to purchase cocoa, or lemon for use with 
cold tea; of seasonings to .purchase red peppers, 
herbs, etc., and in general, it may be said that 
the saving on any component is used to purchase 
articles of the same class,- but here and there a 
little saving for general ptirposes is made. Where 
luxuries are provided, it is generally through un- 
usual economy that has been exercised and good 



EXTRACTS FROM LECTURES. 137 

Judgment shown in purchasing certain deUcacies 
at moderate prices. 

244. * * * Beef is the most important and 
expensive article of the ration, generally from one- 
third to one-half its value; therefore, a saving 
creates a substantial fund upon which to draw 
for other purchases; while an over-draft rapidly 
constimes any savings or money allowance. 
On the other haild, flour is the cheapest com- 
ponent of the ration (nutritive value and general 
usefulness considered) and the more of it used 
the less will be the running expense of the mess. 
These two articles (meat and bread) always 
constitute more than one-half the value of the 
ration and the allowance of both must be care- 
fully checked and not handled by irresponsible 
men. It is noted that when the ration is drawn, 
the lesser part (consisting of the smaller articles 
of the ration) is generally carefully checked 
by the mess sergeant or company commander, 
but frequently no accurate record is kept in 
the company of the bread and meat issued from 
day to day. We are still penny wise and pound 
foolish. * * * * 

245. * * * If the cooks are unfamiliar with 



138 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

handling the ration, do not allow them to touch 
more than the allowance (as determined by the 
cash credit) for the day, for if they do, the food 
will be wasted and the command will go hungry 
before the expiration of the ration period. * * * * 

246. * * * Perishable articles must be care- 
fully preserved and frequently must be consimied 
before others, in order to prevent deterioration 
and loss. * * * * 

247. Unnecessary waste must be prevented 
by the careful prepartion and service of suit- 
able quantities of food. Potatoes must be peeled 
thin or not at all, and the bread served in thin 
slices in small quantities as required. Hundreds 
of pounds of bread were formerly wasted feach 
day on the Army Transports, where it was issued 
in huge chunks instead of thin slices. Un- 
touched food left over from each meal must not 
be thrown away, but should be carefully preserved 
and used in the preparation of some palatable 
dish for a later meal.

not have their contents dripping over the edges, 
and on the floor, nor should the meat and vege-

tables be simply thrown on the dishes on which 
they axe served. It takes but a moment to ar- 
range the platters of food attractively, and to 
wipe off the edges of the dishes so that they 
may be set on the table in an appetizing form. 
Soup should be served in tureens in a course by 
itself, with croutons, or crackers, and the re- 
mainder of the meal should not be brought on 
until the first course is finished. * * * * 

249. When soup is served, coffee or tea 
need not be. The allowance of coffee is suffi- 
cient for making good coffee but twice daily, i. e., 
coffee made with four and one-half ounces per 
gallon of water and one pint allowed to each man. 
Tea is cheaper than coffee and less harmful. It 
is coming into more general use. One-half 
ounces per gallon of water is the amount required, 
and it should not **draw** longer than eight 
minutes. Cocoa and chocolate may be served oc- 
casionally, using two ounces per gallon, but they 
are much more expensive than tea or coffffee.****

CHAPTER VIII. 
DEFINITIONS. 

251. AERATED BREAD. Bread result- 
ing from the dough into which carbonic gas is 
mechanically introduced, in order to save the 
starch, which is otherwise lost as a result of yeast 
fermentation. 

252. ALBUMEN. The transparent, nitro- 
genous substance which forms the chief and 
characteristic constituent of the white of an egg. 
Albtmien is found also in the blood and in all 
serous fluids; also in many animal and vegetable 
juices and solids. 

253. ALLSPICE. A common spice (the 
berry of a West Indian tree) used in mince meat, 
brown cakes, puddings, soups, game entrees, and 
gelatin jellies. Ground or whole, it is used in 
pickling pigs' feet, tripe, sweet pickles, etc. It is 
supposed to combine the flavor of cinnamon, nut- 
megs, and cloves; hence the name. 

141 



142 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

254. AMBERGRIS. Obtained from the 
sperm whale. Also found floating in large cakes 
in the Ii^dian Ocean. It is much used in flavor- 
ing liquors, and in perfumes. 

255. ANILINE. One of the many pro- 
ducts of petroleum. The red shades are harm- 
less, but the chemicals used in making the blue, 
green, yellow, and other colors, are injurious. 
Much used in highly colored confectionery. 

256. ANISEED. A small seed used for 
flavoring. Resembles caraway seed or celery 
seed. 

257. ANNATTO. Obtained from a tropi- 
cal tree. Much used in coloring varnish, silk, 
cheese and butter. 

258. ARROW ROOT. The starch of the 
root/ of a West Indian plant. It is very similar 
to sage and tapioca. It is frequently made into 
a gruel for the sick, but is little used in the com- 
pany. So called from the reputed use of it by 
the natives to heal wounds from poisoned arrows. 

259. BAKING. Cooking in a dry heat, as 
in a closed oven. See ** Methods of Cooking.'* 



x 



DEFINITIONS. 143 

260. BAKING POWDER. A mixture of 
a carbonate of soda and an acid re-agent (g,s 
Cream of Tartar, Phosphoric Acid or some form of 
Alum) together with a small quantity of starch 
or other material to keep the active agents better 
separated. The acid and the carbonate com- 
bine when mixed with water, liberating carbonic 
acid gas, which, in rising, forms in pockets or 
cells in the dough, making it light and spongy. 
Cold water or cold milk should be used in the 
mixture, which should be disturbed as little as 
possible after the baking powder has been added. 
The dough should be baked as soon as possible 
after prepared, or it should be set in a cool place 
until the oven is ready. The objection to the use 
of baking powder is that, as a result of the chemi- 
cal reaction, certain solids are left in the bread, 
cake, etc., which are more or less injurious, but 
they produce no harmful results if used in limited 
quantities. The exclusive use of baking powder 
bread is impracticable as it turns against the 
stomach. Compare with Yeast. 

261. BAKING TEMPERATURE. Gener- 
ally stated as 385 degi:ees Fahr., though bread may 
safely be baked at a somewhat higher or lower 



144 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

temperature, say between 300 and 450 degrees 
Bahr. Many other articles are baked at much 
lower temperatures. 

262. BARBECUE. To roast or broil whole. 
Or, an entertainment for which the carcass of 
an animal, as a hog, is roasted or broiled whole. 

263. BASIL. One of the standard pot 
herbs of the mint family. Much used in turtle 
soup. 

264. BASTE. Sometimes to sprinkle, as 
with pepper or salt; generally, to dash or pour a 
liquid over with a spoon, as in the case of gravy or 
stock in baking or roasting. 

265. BATTER. A thick liquid mixture of 
two or more materials beaten together to be used 
in cooking or'^baking. 

266. BAY LEAVES. Leaves of the Cherry 
Laurel. Much used in soups and stews, and in 
pickling. 

267. BEEF EXTRACT. This is really a 
concentrated beef stock, extracted by boiling beef 
under pressure. It contains very little nutritive 
matter — ^much less than is found in an equivalent 



DEFINITIONS. ' 146 

weight of beef. It is of especial value on accotmt 
of the ease and speed with which it may become 
absorbed into the circulation. It holds an im- 
portant place in the diet of the vsick and conva- 
lescent. 

268. BEEF JUICE. The liquid Remaining 
in fresh beef after properly prepared for con- 
sumption, the blood having been removed. The 
juice may be removed by pressure, or by cutting 
into small pieces and placing in cold water. The 
juice having been drawn out, the water is evapo- 
rated. Much of the so-called beef juice on the 
market is said to be prepared from the blood of 
the slaughtered animal. 

269. BEEF TEA. This is really unfiltered 
beef stock. Instead of constantly skimming. the 
surface of the stock, the coagulated albumen is 
allowed to remain. It should be made of the best 
meat. One-half pound of good beef tea may be 
made from one pound of meat and one quart of 
water. It has little real nutritive value, but like 
beef extract, is a light stimulant. 

270. BENCH. A molding table. 

271. BISK (or BISQUE). A shell-fish 
soup. 



146 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

272. BLANCH. To scald vegetables, nuts, 
etc., to remove the outside skins or hulls. 

273. BLOOD HEAT. The normal tem- 
perature of the human body, 98 degrees Fahr. 

274. BOILING. The conversion of a liquid 
into steam by the application of sufficient heat 
to cause ebullition, or disturbance of the stuface. 
As applied to cooking, it is heating or cook- 
ing in a boiling liquid. (See ** Methods of Cook- 
ing.") 

Water boils at 212 degrees Fahr., at the sea 
level. It simmers when the bubbles break be- 
neath the stirface say 185 degrees Fahr. It is 
scalding hot at 150 degrees Fahr., or at a tempera- 
ture such that the hand cannot be borne in it. 
Salt water boils at 224 degrees Fahr. Other solids, 
as for example sugar, also increase the boiling point 
of water. A solution having reached the boiling 
point, the temperature cannot be increased by 
any amount of additional heat, except under pres- 
sure, as would result from boiling in a closed 
vessel. 

Lard smokes at 385 degrees Fahr., and boils at 
about 600 degrees Fahr. Hence, it is evident that 
greavSe, even if not at the smoking or boiling 



DEFINITIONS. 147 

point, may be much hotter than boiling water — 
a fact that should always be borne in mind in 
handling it and in cooking. 

275. BOUILLON. A clear meat brotlv- or 
soup in rich extractives. 

276. BRAINS. The brains of most slaugh- 
tered animals are used for food and are considered 
a luxury. Calves' brains are considered the best, 
although there is but little difference, and all 
brains are generally sold imder this name. 

277. BRAISING. Method of combining the 
roasting and stewing of meat in a closed vessel 
with heat from both top and bottom, as in a 
Dutch Oven. It is one of the best methods of 
.cooking tough, lean meat. If the kettle is placed 
in a slow oven, it requires little further atten- 
tion. 

278. BROILING. Properly speaking, it is 
cooking over red hot coals by direct exposure to 
the heat of an open fire, though the term is ap- 
plied to cooking on an iron plate interposed be- 
tween the fire and the article cooked. In broiling 
the fire should be clear and free from smoke. 
Charcoal is the best fuel to use. It is better to 



148 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

broil before a fire than over it, in order to save 
the dripping grease and avoid the smoky flavor 
though the smoke from the fat itself is not as 
objectionable as that from coal or wood. 

279. CALORIE. Quantity of heat required 
to raise on kilogram of water one degree C. This 
is the equivalent of 1.54 foot tons. Food values 
are expressed in calories, and the soldiers' daily 
ration exceeds 5,000. 

280. CAPERS. Unopened buds of a trail- 
ing shrub grown in Southern Europe. Pickled 
and much used in sauces. .Caper sauce is fre- 
quently served with mutton. 

281. CARMEL. A sirup made from scorched 
sugar, used largely in coloring sauces, as well as 
for flavoring. 

282. CARAWAY SEED. Seed of a garden 
herb. Grows like the seed of a carrot or parsnip. 
Used in various cakes and sweet crackers, in rye 
bread, and in liquors. 

283. CARBOHYDRATES. Starches, sugars 
and the fibers of plants. It is principally a source 
of energy. The surplus is stored in the body as 
fat. 



DEFINITIONS. 149 

284. CASEIN. A proteid compound found 
principally in milk, of which it is the most import- 
ant ingredient. When coagulated, it forms the 
principal ingredient in cheese. 

285. CASINGS. A term appHed to the in- 
testines of all animals. They are used to receive 
sausage, bologna, etc. The hog's stomach is 
actually used as a receptacle for his head when it 
is converted in to head cheese. 

286. CASSIA. Bark of a tree similar to 
Cinanmon. Cultivated in China. Also called 
Chinese Cinnamon. 

287. CELERY SALT. Much used in salads 
and seasonings. Prepared by mixing ground 
celery seed and salt in the proportions in weight 
of two to one. 

288. CENTIGRADE. Graded to a scale 
of 100. On the Centigrade thermometer scale, 
the freezing point of water is 0, and the boiling 
point 100. 

289. CHERVIL. A garden herb much used 
in soups. 

290. CHICORY. A perennial herb of the 
aster family, with heads of large bright blue 



1 



150 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

flowers, and dandelion-like roots. The roasted 
and pulverized root is used in adulterating coffee 
and as a substitute for it. If grains of coffee con- 
taining chicory are dropped into cold water, the 
chicory will settle at once and be followed by a 
cloudy streak. 

291. CHILI. Red sweet pepper. 

292. CHIVES. A kind of green onion. Tops 
are slender and pipe-like. Much used in soups 
and sauces.

tracted. It contains about 35 per cent, of vege- 
table fat and 45 per cent, of cane sugar. Very 
nourishing. 

294. CHOWDER. A dish of stewed fresh 
or salt fish, or clams, with vegetables and crackers 
added. 

295. CHUTNEY. An East Indian sweet 
pickle. 

296. CINNAMON. The inner bark of the 
cinnamon, or cassia, tree. Grown in Ceylon and 
used as a spice. 



DEFINITIONS. ' 151 

297. CITRON. Large coarse fruit of the 
lemon family. Used in mince meat and preserves. 

298. CLOVES. Flower buds of the clove 
tree carefully picked and dried. Should always 
be purchased whole as they deteriorate rapidly 
when ground. 

299. COCHINEAL. Coloring matter made 
from the dried bodies of small insects foimd 
in the Southwestern part of the United States, 
in Mexico, and in Central America. It is harm- 
less. 

300. COCOA. Similar to chocolate, but not 
as rich. It is groimd from the cocoa bean after 
much of the fat has been pressed out. 

301. COMINA. An herb found in the 
Southwestern part of the United States and in 
Mexico. Much used in seasoning soups and 
stews. 

302. COMPOUND. A substitute for lard 
commonly used in bakeries; of about the follow- 
ing composition, 75 per cent, cottonseed oil, 25 
per cent., beef stearin. The results obtained are 
about the same as when using lard, and its use in 
company kitchens is recommended for economy. 



162 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

303. CONDIMENT. Something to give 
relish to the food and gratify the taste. General 
term for seasoning. 

304. CRACKLINGS. The crisp residue 
of hog fat after the lard has been tried out. It 
may be used in hash, or corn bread, but is valu- 
able only in proportion as the amount of fat that 
is left in it. 

305. CRACKLING BREAD. Com bread 
to which cracklings have been added. 

306. CREAM BREAD. Bread baked in 
superheated steam, as when moisture is artifi- 
cially introduced into an oven, or the bread baked 
under inverted pans, giving a very thin crust and 
a light color. 

307. CROQUETTES. A mass of finely 
minced and seasoned meat, fish, rice or potatoes, 
etc., made into a ball or other regular shape, 
rolled in cracker cnimbs and fried in deep lard 
until crisp. 

308. CROUTONS. Cubes of toasted bread. 
Generally served with soup. 

309. CRULLERS. Small cakes made from 
a sweet dough mixture and fried in deep lard. 



DEFINITIONS. 163 

They may be made with either baking powder or 
yeast. 

310. CRUMB. The soft inner part of the 
loaf, as distinguished from the crust. 

311. CURRY POWDER. A yellow powder 
formed by a mixture of numerous hot pepper 
and ginger. Used as a high seasoning for stews, 
etc. 

312. CUTLETS. Term usually appUed to 
the rib cuts of pork, mutton, lamb, veal, venison, 
etc., but not of beef. 

313. DEVILLED. Highly seasoned. 

314. DEVILLED MEAT. Cooked meats 
finely ground and highly seasoned. 

315. DOUGH. Technically, the mixture re- 
sulting from breaking up the sponge and adding 
the remainder of the flour and other ingredients 
to be used in making the bread. The term is also 
applied to the resulting mixture in any subse- 
quent stage, and sometimes to any mixture in 
which flour forms the greater part. 

Young or Green Dough. One not fully ma- 
tured, or not yet risen to the maximum height to 
which it will prove. 



154 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

Ripe Dough. One that has fully matured. 

Old or Rotten Dough. One that has been 
allowed to stand longer than the normal length 
of time, so that it begins to show signs of sour- 
ness. In pulling a portion from the general mass, 
it wil tear more readily than usual, on accotmt of 
the gluten having become weakened by the action 
of acids upon it. 

Sour Dough. Generally, one containing a 
large percentage of acid, on accotmt of being 
allowed to ferment without the introduction of 
yeast. A sour dough may also result from un- 
clean utensils, from proving in too high a tempera- 
ture, from too long fermentation, or from yeast 
containing acid germs. 

316. DOUGH-BREAK. A dough knead- 
ing machine with corrugated rollers. 

317. DOUGHNUTS. Small cakes made 
from a dough mixture, and fried in deep lard.

and salt, or rub in as with flour, etc. 

319. DUMPLINGS. Pieces of dough, some- 



DEFINITIONS. 155 

times with fniit or vegetables enclosed, boiled 
or baked. If served with meats or stews, the 
pieces of dough should be dropped into the boiling 
hot beef stock or stew about eight minutes before 
being served. 

320. EGGS. For domestic purposes, eggs 
should be kept in a cool, dark place — the nearer 
to the freezing point the better. However, 
changes are constantly taking place within the 
egg, producing a certain amount of heat, and 
partly for this reason, eggs will stand a tempera- 
ture somewhat lower than freezing. 

The porous nature of the shell facilitates de- 
composition, and eggs dipped in varnish, or other 
solution (e. g., silicate of soda), that will perma- 
nently fill the pores will keep much longer than 
others. Even **cold storage eggs" should not be 
kept longer than six weeks. They are, however, 
often kept for a period of six months, or even 
more, but during this time they acquire a dis- 
tinctly unpleasant odor and flavor. Eggs kept 
for a long time in cold storage, or decayed in any 
way, are extremely injurious. 

321. EGG PLANT. An egg shaped fruit 
with a dark, ptirple exterior, weighing from one 



166 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

to three potrnds. Raised in the South. Allied to 
the tomato.

ious guises, with sauces and gamishings, between 
courses, or at the beginning of a dinner. 

323. ESTRAGON or TARRAGON. A gar- 
den herb used to flavor vinegar, soups, sauces, etc. 

324. EXTRACTIVES. The principal in- 
gredient of beef extract, beef tea, etc. They act 
as stimulants and appetizers, but have little or no 
nutritive value. 

325. FAHRENHEIT. The thermometer 
scale commonly used in the United States and 
Great Britian, on which 32 marks the freezing 
point of water, and 212 the boiling point. 

326. FARINA. A fine flour or meal made 
from cereal grains or from the starch of vege- 
tables. Some forms specially prepared for break- 
fast foods. 

327 . FENNEL. A garden plant much culti- 
vated in England. Grows wild in Florida. Used

337. FRICASSE. A dish of meat, as of 
fowl, cut into pieces, fried until partially done and 
stewed in gravy. 

338. FRIED CAKES. Domestic term for 
doughnuts or crullers. A general term also ap- 
plied to batter cakes, potato cakes, etc. 

339. FRITTERS. A small quantity of 
batter usually inclosing or containing some other 
substances and fried in deep lard, e. g., com frit- 
ters, apple fritters, etc. 

340. GARLIC. A bulb like an onion, with 
a strong characteristic smell and pungent taste. 
A clove of garlic means one of the natural sub- 
divisions of the bulb. A favorite condiment of 
the people of Southern Europe and of the Orient.

tained from animal tissues after long boiling. It 
readily dissolves in hot water, and forms a jelly 
upon cooling. While in the liquid state, it may 
be given any flavor desired. It makes an excel- 
lent cheap summer dessert. Easily digested and 
much used in the sick-room. Not of great nutri-

root from which the outer siirface has been re- 
moved. 

347. GLACE. Icing. 

348. GLUCOSE. A cheap sugar that will 
not easily crystallize, or a cheap sirup that will 
not crystallize — ^very much like ** Silver Drip" 
but much thicker. Glucose is often made by 
treating commeal with sulfuric acid. It is very 
wholesome. 

349. GLUTEN. The muscle building ele- 
ment of wheat, rye and other grains. The 
strength of flour and the toughness and tenacity 
of dough are determined by the quantity of the 
gluten present. 

350. GRAHAM FLOUR. Unbolted flour,

thigh of an animal, but the **ham" of the hog is 
prepared from either the thigh or shoulder. 

355. HAM BUTTS. Part of the hog cor- 
responding very closely to the chuck of the beef. 
It is a portion of the shoulder directly above that

prevent sourness. 

358. ICE. A general term frequently ap- 
plied to frozen creams, custards, and other des- 
serts, as well as to water ices. The latter are 
fruit juices sweetened with sugar sirup and stirred 
while freezing. 

359. ICING. Same as frosting. Generally 
speaking, made of the whites of eggs, with sugar 
and suitable flavoring, as lemon, vanilla, etc. 

360. JAM. A preserve of fruit boiled with 
sugar and water. 



162 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

361. JELLY. The juice of fruits or meats 
boiled to an elastic consistence. In making fruit 
jellies, sugar and suitable flavor is added. 

362. KIDNEYS from all slaughtered ani- 
mals are used in stews, etc. There is not any 
great demand for them in American . markets, 
but great quantities are shipped abroad. Pigs' 
kidneys are considered the best. 

363. LAMB CHOPS. The short ribs of 
lamb, with the attached flesh. 

364. LARD. The fat of swine. It is fre- 
quently adulterated by the addition of a large 
proportion of cottonseed oil. Pure cottonseed 
oil, to which stearin is added, making a fairly good 
substitute. In addition, lard and cottonseed oil 
compounds are frequently further adulterated by 
the addition of water, the presence of which is 
noted by the crackling and sputtering when 
placed in the spider, or when a small lump is 
dropped into the fire. 

Watered lard is unnaturally white. Good firm 
lard is the best for pastries, although refined oil 
and *'lard compounds'' will do for most purposes. 



DEFINITIONS. 163

troduce thin pieces of pork, ham or bacon, into 
meats deficient in fat, to improve their flavor. 

366. LEAF LARD. This consists of the 
leaves of fat lining the back of the hog. It may 
be torn out without cutting. It is the best quality 
of lard and may be used in many instances with- 
out rendering, if desired. The next best quality 
of lard is that which is found connected with the 
intestines called ** intestinal lard,'' and the third 
quality comes from the back of the hog. 

367. LEAVEN. A piece of old dough used 
with new dough for the purpose of starting fer- 
mentation. 

368. LEEK. A species of onion, but the 
leaves are flat instead of round. Much used in

cacy when served with bacon, in hotels and 
restaurants. Beef liver is the next best; then 
pig's liver. The liver of mutton is very dry and 
tasteless. 

372. MACARONI. First prepared in Italy. 
A strong flour is made into a stiff dough, pressed 
into long tubes, and dried in the sun, or by slow

meg. It is a good flavoring for meats and cream 
soups, puddings and sweets. 

374. MALT. Barley or other grain that

ticularly aromatic and fragrant. Much used in 
seasonings. 



DEFINITIONS. 165

Prepared from the yolk of eggs, with mustard, 
olive oil, lemon, salt, etc., added. 

378. MERINGUE. A kind of icing made

by the Department of Agriailture to designate 
all kinds of artificial butter. 

387. OKRA. A vegetable plant whose green 
pods are often used in soups, stews, etc. Also 
served as a vegetable. 

388. OLEIN. Olein is that portion of oil 
or fat which gives it fluidity. Fat contains more

with stearin. 

389. OREGANO. An herb much used in 
seasoning soups and stews. 



DEFINITIONS. 167 

390. OSEILLE OR SORREL. A green 
herb used as greens and in soup. 

391. OVEN COUNT. The "count" of 
an oven is determined by the number of seconds 
that the arm and hand, while at a normal tempera- 
ture, may be introduced to their full extent, into 
the oven chamber and held continuously with- 
out withdrawal. It is reliable only in the case of 
a dry oven, as moisture has a tendency to scald 
the flesh and force a premature withdrawal. In 
a perfectly dry oven, twelve counts (seconds) is 
about right for baking in a brick or earthen oven. 
If even a small amount of moisture were present, 
the same temperature of the oven would be in- 
dicated by a ismaller count, say eight or six. 

To count seconds, repeat moderately slowly: 
0-1,000, 1-1,000, 2-1,000, and the small numbers 
indicated will correspond very closely with the 
number of seconds. 

392. OVEN, QUICK. One heated to a 
higher temperature than normal, say about 385 
degrees Fahr. An oven of less than twelve 
counts. 

393. OVEN, SLOW. One heated to less

168 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

low 385 degrees Fahr. An oven of more than 
about fifteen counts. 

394. OYSTER PLANT. (Salsify.) A white

for garnishing and in flavoring soups, stews, cro- 
quettes, etc. 

398. PARSNIPS. A creamy white root re- 
sembling the carrot in shape. Much used in 
stews and frequently served as a vegetable. Like 
the oyster plant, it is considered best when left 
in the ground over winter. 

399. PATTIES. There are two distinct 
kinds of patties. First, a puff paste shell baked 
and afterward filled. Second, small pies made by 
lining patty pans with short paste, filling with

oysters, chicken, etc., covered with a top crust 
and baked. 

400. PEPPER. The white pepper is made 
from the ripe seeds, and the black pepper from 
seeds picked before they are ripe. White pepper 
is much better for cooking purposes, as it does 
not show dark specks. Black pepper is pre- 
ferred for flavoring, especially in dishes that are 
to be strained afterwards. Pepper is much sub- 
ject to adulteration and whole pepper should be 
purchased and ground at home. 

401. PEPPER, CAYENNE. Red pepper 
pods and seeds ground. Often adulterated with 
yellow commeal, mustard hulls, etc.

but not approached in a closed oven. 

412. SACCHARIN. A white, sweetening 
substance (powder) obtained from coal tar and 
said to possess 300 times the sweetening power of 
sugar. It possesses certain antiseptic qualities 
and is a powerful anti-ferment. It contains no 
nutriment and is little used as a seasoning. Form- 
erly used in tablet form with the Army standard 
emergency ration for sweetening coffee. 

413. SAFFRON. The petals of a flower- 
ing plant. Made into a tea and added to the 
dough, or stew, etc. 

414. SAGE. A plant with grayish green 
leaves and much used in seasoning meats and 
stews. 

415. SAGO. It is made from the pith of 
a palm tree which grows in the East Indies. It 
is nearly pure starch and has many imitations 
on the market, but the form of the grain of the 
latter disappears in cooking. It is cooked in the 
same way as tapioca and is also much used in 
soups. 

416. SALSIFY. See Par. 394. 



172 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

417. SAUSAGE. There are from fifty to 
sixty different kinds of sausage put up in the 
packing houses, the components, quality and 
seasoning differing to meet the requirements of 
foreign and domestic trade. In the course of 
preparation, they are generally subjected to the 
smoke from hickory or other hard wood, and 
then cooked in vats of water, at a temperature of 
about 160 degrees, from ten minutes for frank- 
furters to three hours for bung sausages. 

Summer sausages are first smoked and then 
placed in a drying temperature for about three 
months. The material put into suasages com- 
pares favorably with that put on the market in 
other forms. 

Bull meat is used to considerable extent, as it 
takes up more moisture than other meats. 
The best pork sausage contains no beef. 

Liver sausage is one of the cheapest and con- 
tains lungs (lights) as well as liver and other in- 
gredients not put into better grades. 

. A good quality may contain from one-third 
to one-half of beef, and for Army Sausage, this is 
an ordinary proportion.

DEFINITIONS, 173 

with but little fat — ^first on one side and then on 
the other. 

419. SCALD. As applied to flour, potatoes, 
etc., to submerge or wet with water at a tempera- 
ture of 160 degrees Fahr., or more — sufficiently 
hot to dissolve the bands of the starch cells and 
expose the individual grains composing it, gener- 
ally to the action of the yeast plant. 

To scald utensils, etc., tojdash over with boil- 
ing hot water. 

420. SCALLOP. A moUusk similar to an 
oyster. The shell is corrugated and radiates from 
the center. Scalloped dishes. Dishes made in the 
form of a scallop shell. 

421. SCALLOPED OYSTERS. Oysters 
baked in scalloped dishes, or rolled in cracker or

the first step in the process of bread making. A 
sponge is said to be green or young before it has 
fully mattu'ed; ripe when it has matured, and is 
ready to be broken up preparatory to making the 
dough; and old, or rotten, when it has passed the 
ripe stage, and having risen and fallen more than 



DEFINITIONS. 175 

once, probably contains a relatively high percent- 
age of acid, making it sour. 

431. STALE BREAD. Bread in which 
all free moisttire has so combined with the crumb 
as to give it th^ appearance of dryness. This 
takes place when the bread is from eighteen to 
twenty-fotir hours old. 

432. STARCH. A whiter, odorless, taste- 
less, flour-like compound, insoluble in cold water, 
alcohol and other liquids. Fotmd in all grains 
and seeds of plants, with but few exceptions. It 
is readily transformed into sugar compounds. 

433. STEARIN. That portion of fats, lard, 
suet, etc., that gives it solidity. 

434. STERILIZE. To destroy harmless or 
disease bearing bacteria. Generally accomplished 
in the utensils used in the kitchen by the use 
of boiling hot water to which lye is sometimes 
added. The sterlizing of all utensils used in hand- 
ling yeasts and doughs is absolutely necessary, in 
order to prevent souring. 

435. STOCK. The Hquid or jelly obtained 
by boiling meat, bones, etc., for several hours, in 
water. It is the basis of all good soups. 



176 THE MESS OFFICER'S ASSISTANT. 

436. SUCCOTASH. Green com and beans 
boiled together.

438. SWEETBREADS. The thymus gland 
(found in the neck of slaughtered animals) and the 
pancreas (found near the stomach). They have 
very little natural flavor, but are very tender 
and considered a delicacy. Those from the calf 
are best, next best from the beef, sheep and hog in 
the order named. 

439. TALLOW. Properly speaking, it is the 
fat of beef, sheep or other animals, from which a 
portion of the oil has been extracted making it 
harder than the natural fat. 

440. TAPIOCA. A starch extracted from a 
South American plant. Used in puddings. Very

It has but little flavor, but is considered by many, 
as a very valuable food. It is very easily di- 
gested. . 

444. VINEGAR. The sour liquid formed by 
the spontaneous acetic fermentation, or artificial 
oxidation of beer, wine, cider, etc. 

445. YEAST. Yeast grows in small spores 
that reproduce themselves every four or five hours. 
The spore is foimd anywhere, floating about in the 
air, and wherever the proper conditions of food, 
moisture and warmth are found, it grows spon- 
taneously. While in a dry state it is unaffected 
by the ordinary temperatures, though freezing, or 
a temperature above 160 degrees Fahr., will kill it 
in the liquid state. While it * * works * * or grows, it 
evolves a carbonic gas which gives to the dough a 
cellular structure. While proving, the dough 
should be kept in an even temperature of about 80 
degrees, and this should be about the average tem- 
perature of the dough ingredients when mixed to- 
gether.
