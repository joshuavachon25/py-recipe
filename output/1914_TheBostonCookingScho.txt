This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

^ if made from lard it's bound 

to be greasy and indigestible, and isn't good 
for their little stomachs; if made from butter, 
it's too expensive — at present butter prices. 

Cottolene 

is far better than lard because it is a vegetable 
product, never makes food greasy, never causes 
indigestion. It is the equal of butter at about 
one-third the price. So why be extravagant? 

Feed the "kiddies" their fill of pastry — if made 
from Cottolene it won't harm them. 

Cottolene is both economical and healthful.

An Attractive Living Room 



Bv W. F. H. 



THE living-room, in which the 
family gathers every day, should 
be the most attractive room in 
the house, as it is the most important. 
Combining as it does the functions of 
parlor and reception-room, library and 
sitting-room, its manifold uses should 
lend it a charm of expression, if worked 
out with painstaking intelligence. 

The real essentials are that it should 
be cleanly, cheerful, and comfortable. 
When these ends have been gained, it 
will be surprising if we do not find the 
room beautiful, provided that we have 
taken due care to break none of the well- 
known laws of harmony. 

In order to insure perfect cleanliness, 
in accordance with sanitary standards of 
the present day, we have discarded in a 
large measure the heavy and cumbrous 
hangings which were in vogue only a 
few years ago. Portieres, carpets, and 
heavy window draperies are looked upon 
with disfavor, and in their place we have 
rugs and washable hangings. 

To promote cheerfulness, we prefer a 
light, trim and inconspicuous wall cover- 
ing, with restful lines and effects in both 
furnishings and architecture. We choose 
cheerful subjects in pictures. We tone 
up dark and sombre colorings with 
touches bright and attractive. 

In making the room comfortable, we 
find it necessary to use furnishings along 



Colonial lines, or along those of the mod- 
ern Mission and Craftsman types. We 
try to have a fireplace, for warmth and 
companionship. We favor built-in seats 
for the bay window and for the ingleside. 

The older idea of a number of small 
separate rooms was a good one for the 
days when stoves furnished our only 
heating apparatus; but for the present 
time, when heated houses are the rule, 
it will be found more convenient Sfmany 
cases to throw two or three small rooms 
into one, by removing partitions. In the 
case of old houses having front and back 
parlors, the union of the two by taking 
down the division will convert the whole 
into a delightful living-room. 

In a house where alterations or re- 
pairs are necessarily being made, such a 
change can well be secured at little addi- 
tional cost, by having it put into the 
original estimate. It is well to be sure 
that the items include such details as 
built-in seats, bookcases, or china closets, 
together with wainscoting and cross- 
beamed ceilings, if they are desired, as 
the lumping of the details together often 
effects a considerable saving. 

When remodeling is being done, it is 
well to remember that all the woodwork 
for a living-room should be plain to the 
point of severity, especially in houses of 
moderate cost. Basswood, whitewood, 
or white pine, make a very good finish

where the trim is to be light paint. If 
a stain is desired, it is well to use some 
wood with more beautiful grain, as yel- 
low pine, ash, or chestnut. 

The furniture should harmonize with 
the trim, as far as possible, but good 
Craftsman lines ought to harmonize with 
anything; so would good Colonial, and 
the useful wicker furniture, which can 
be used in its natural color until we tire 
of it, and then can be stained green, 
brown, or mahogany. 

In general, a plain wall covering will 
give most satisfaction in a room of this 
character, where the number of objects 
makes an unobtrusive background espe- 
cially effective. If a. paper with a pro- 
nounced figure were used here, much of 
the charm of the room would vanish. A 
plain effect as a background is absolutely 
necessary in any room where there are 
many pictures and much bric-a-brac. 

Color combinations are always hard to 
suggest, but we will suppose that a red 
room is wanted, to convey the impression 



of warmth and cheer, while the furniture 
is mostly oak, of the Mission type. A 
very pleasant effect would result from 
combining an ivory ceiling with soft red 
walls, in plain or two-toned paper. Let 
the trim be light Flemish, the tiles of the 
fireplace green, the curtains dull green, 
the rug a mixture of red, green, and 
ivory, or tan, with red predominating. 

A very good effect for a living-room 
results from the combination of green 
with blue, two colors whose blending is 
most pleasing when done properly. One 
satisfactory method would be to combine 
a slate green ceiling with side walls of 
olive and a trim of olive brown. Choose 
curtains of Gobelin blue, and rugs and 
upholstery of green and blue, with a 
dash of orange. 

When blue and green are combined, a 
third color used sparingly adds to the 
harmony. Since orange is the comple- 
ment of blue, its use with blue makes a 
harmony of contrast. At the same time, 
it forms an analc^;ous harmony with 



LIVING ROOM IN MIS 



AN ATTRACTIVE LIVING ROOM 



LIVING ROOM. SHOWING STAIRWAY. ETC, 



green, because both orange and green are 
composed in part of the same color, 
which is yellow. 

Now another good way to combine 
these two colors, and such a combination 
has enjoyed great popularity this year, 
would be to combine an old ivory ceiling 
with Gobelin blue walls and a trim of 
medium olive. Lei the curtains be dull 
green, and the rugs and upholstery blue, 
mingled with olive green and a little clear 
yellow, but with blue strongly predomi- 
nating. Here we should have a related 
harmony, instead of a complementary, 
because green is formed by mixing blue 
and yellow. 

As the piano has to stand in the living- 
room, and forms its largest piece of 
furniture, we can sometimes gather val- 
uable suggestions for furnishing from 
simply considering the kind of wood in 
its case. Take the instance of a living- 
room where the piano case is mahogany, 
and there is also a mahogany table and 
old-fashioned desk. The white trim 
shows scars, and the owner is tired of 
white paint, and also tired of green cart- 
ridge paper. She longs for a change. 



and the room needs renovating. 

Now white trim with mahogany furni- 
ture is always safe, but if we tire of it, 
we must not deem it inevitable. There 
is another combination fully as charm- 
ing, and that is its union with old rose 
and silver. 

The trim must be gone over in pearl 
gray enamel, and one coat will suffice, 
unless the white is badly scarred. Then 
put on a ceiling paper of pearl-gray with 
silver stars, and a side wall of pearl-gray 
ground with very small dull pink roses 
and gray-green leaves climbing up sil- 
vered stripes. Your rug will do. It has 
green and mahogany predominating, with 
glimpses of gray and pink. See that all 
the fixtures are silvered. Put up cer- 
tains of old rose cotton crepe, and por- 
tieres of the same material ; or, if you 
prefer the rajah for its uneven weave, 
get both hangings in that ; or get the por- 
tieres in rajah and the curtains in sheer 
China silk. The old rose coloring is the 
vital point; your taste must govern ma- 
terial. See that your couch cover has 
old rose predominating, shot with green 
and silver. Let the cushions incline 



14 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



strongly toward old rose, with mere hints 
of the other two colorings. The result 
will be charming. 

The cheerfulness of many living- 
rooms is impaired by the disproportion- 
ate hight of the ceiling, when compared 
with the length and breadth of the floor 
space. This is a fault more common in 
city houses than in country homes. It 
makes less difference in a formal parlor 
than in any other room in the house, be- 
cause such an apartment is not marred by 
distance and stateliness ; but a living- 
room should be cosy and homelike. The 
housebuilder should see to it that its in- 
viting charm is not sacrificed to undue ■ 
hight of ceiling. 

For those of us who may not build 
our own houses, but must perforce in- 
herit the mistakes of former architects 
and occupants, the case is not hopeless. 
The artful introduction of horizontal 
lines will do much to reduce this diffi- 
culty. The color used in the ceiling can 
be brought down upon the side wall at 
least eighteen inches, with a picture 
molding to cover its joining with the 



covering of the side wall proper. A 
wainscoting can be extended up from 
the floor to a hight of four or five feet 
and capped by another molding as a 
finish. There is jio roorfi in any house 
which is not improved by a suitable 
wainscot, and such is their infinite va- 
riety that one may be selected to suit any 
room, at a cost to suit any purse. 

Where the trim is white and the effect 
Colonial, the plaster between the base- 
board and chair-rail can be painted 
white, like the woodwork, and makes a 
very good substitute for wainscoting. 
Another popular substitute is made by 
laying strips against a burlap backing. 
Where the trim is chestnut, use chestnut 
strips about three inches wide, laid in 
panel effect against a burlap wall-cover- 
ing of tan or green. Finish by a plain 
chestnut molding about five feet from 
the floor. The number of strips and the 
resulting width of the panels must de- 
pend upon the size of the room and the 
hight of the wainscot, which might bet- 
ter be four feet than five, in case that 
the room is ten feet high, since we must

UNIQUE AND OUT OK THE ORDINARY 



avoid lateral divisions into halves, as 
they prove commonplace and monoto- 
nous. Wainscoting the wall is perhaps 
the best method of lowering the appar- 
ent hight of the ceiling. 

Next to the remote and unfriendly as- 
pect of the lofty ceiling, the greatest 
drawback to cheerfulness in a living- 
room seems to be lack of a suitable sup- 
ply of light, both natural and artificial. 
Sometimes this is due to prevalence of 
dark tones in woodwork, wall-covering, 
and furniture. More often, it results 
from poorly-planned and inadequate 
windows. There seems to be little help 
for this unless we can call in the services 
of architect or skilled workman, and 
have one or two good groups of modern 
windows inserted into the walls of the 
apartment. 

Where this cannot be done, great care 
should be used to employ a white or very 
light-colored trim, with yellowish tan for 
the leading color in wall covering, rugs, 
and couch cover. Curtains of yellow 
China silk will do much to brighten up 
such a room as this, and special pains 
must be taken not to introduce hangings 



of heavy weight or of dark colors to 
absorb the light. 

As to artificial light, in a large room, 
a central chandelier may be necessary, 
and it must be hung high for safety ; 
but see to it that the side-lights about 
the room are placed conveniently low, 
and let the main source of light in your 
living-room be a large reading-lamp, in 
an effective situation. Beautiful lamps 
for such a purpose are now made, to be 
connected with a supply of gas or elec- 
tricity, or in country bungalows not sup- 
plied with these modern innovations, to 
be filled with kerosene. The effect of a 
light placed on a table makes for beauty 
in the whole living-room. The introduc- 
tion of this one homelike touch does 
wonders for the evening appearance of 
the ordinary apartment. 

The appearance of comfort in this 
room will be much enhanced by the in- 
troduction of a built-in seat, either at the 
window, in a corner, or at the ingleside. 
A couch is also desirable, in fact almost 
imperatively necessary, for a living- 
room, in order to convey a proper sense 
of ease and informality.

A Ballad of Too Much Beauty 



There is too much beauty upon this earth 

For lonely men to bear, 
Too many eyes, loo enchanted skies, 

Too many things too fair ; 
And the man who would live the life of a man 
Must turn his eyes away — if he can. 

He must nol look at the dawning day, 

Or watch the rising moon ; 
From the little feet, so while, so fleet. 

He must turn his eyes away; 
And the flowers and the faces he must pass Iiy 
With stern self-saerifidng eye. 



For beauty and duty are strangers forever. 

Work and wonder ever apart, 
And the laws of life eternally sever 

The ways of the brain from the ways of ihc 
heart; 
Be it flower or pearl, or the face of a girl, 
Or the ways of the waters as they swirl. 

For beauty is sorr 
Have no hearl t 

Or hear the remorseful voice of the sea. 
Or the song of ihc wandering wind In the 

Or even watch a butterfly. 



.^h ! Beauty is such a hallowed thing, 

So holy a flower in the garden of God, 
That none but the holy should dare to look 
On the painted page of that sacred book, 
Look in the eyes of spring. 
Or hear the morning sing.

Mrs. Jessup*s Birthday Cake 



By Anna W. Morrison 



I'LL do it," exclaimed Mary Ly- 
dell, as she watched Milly Nor- 
ton walk briskly down the 
bricked walk to the street. 

Miss Norton, the village dressmaker, 
had just dropped in a second on her 
way to the grocery, to tell Mary about 
Hester Snow's wedding dress and in- 
cidentally remind her of another mar- 
riage which might have taken place 
but did not, and for which she had 
never quite forgiven Mary for sto- 
ically refusing to g^ve her a hint as 
to the reason. 

"Mrs. Jessup's seventy years old to- 
day," Miss Norton added as she rose 
to leave. "But there isn't any reason 
of my telling you that. You're too 
familiar with the family events, I'm 
sure." Miss Norton continued insin- 
uatingly as she peered at Mary from 
a pair of narrow grey eyes. 

The entire population of Bethel had 
watched the courtship of Mary Lydell 
and Ralph Jessup for several years; 
then rejoiced when the engagement 
became a fact. It eagerly awaited the 
church wedding and feast, which vil- 
lage gossips had set for June two years 
past. Why Ralph Jessup should sud- 
denly throw up a good position in the 
bank and leave for the west the vil- 
lagers were never able to secure an 
answer. Mary Lydell ignored all 
questions on this subject and Mrs. 
Jessup just glared at anyone bold 
enough to question her. Betsy Liep, 
the Jessup's hired help, drew her 
mouth into a mere slit when the sub- 
ject was referred to by neighbors. 

Before the wicket had ceased click- 
ing, as it swung back and forth after 
Miss Norton had given it a careless 
push, Mary was in her immaculate 
kitchen. She slipped an amethyst set 
ring from her finger and placed it on 



the little shelf above the kitchen table ; 
then scrubbed her hands thoroughly 
at the sink. 

"Shall it be molasses, fruit, or elec- 
tion cake?" she asked herself as she 
gave her hands an extra wipe on the 
roller towel. 

Evidently it was the latter, for she 
lifted the pan of bread dough from 
the warming shelf where she had 
placed it for its second raising. Care- 
fully she measured out one pint of the 
creamy mixture, setting the bowl one 
side, while she molded four velvety 
loaves of bread and disposed them in 
their pans for their third raising. Care- 
fully she arranged them side by side 
on the warming shelf, then com- 
menced the cake. Into the big gray 
mixing bowl she dumped the dough, 
following with butter, sugar and egg 
yolks; then measured out the cinna- 
mon, cloves, all-spice and grated nut- 
meg, tapping the spoon against the 
tin cans to ensure just the correct 
measurement, which would ensure the 
delicate flavor that had made her spice 
cakes famous. As she worked these 
ingredients into the dough, her thoughts 
reverted to the eventful day three 
years ago this month. She was making 
election cake then and Ralph was 
bolstering up the door jamb lead- 
ing to the back yard. He had cut 
cross lots to tell her that he was will- 
ing to eat her election cake forever if 
she was willing. 

Mary's face flushed and burned at 
the recollection of his words, then she 
became angry for allowing herself to 
even think of that day. She stirred 
the soda vigorously into the milk un- 
til a thick foam covered the top. By 
the time the whites of the eggs were 
whipped to a froth that resembled 
newly fallen snow she had regained 



17

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



her composure. 

"It was probably all for the best," 
she voiced aloud as she larded the 
paper neatly fitted into the loaf pan. 
"Ralph was always obstinate, his 
mother said, so it is just as well we 
never got any further than being en- 
gaged." Mary reached for the little 
Scotch jar that held the raisins and 
lifting the lid peered into its depths. 

"Land sakes! Not a raisin." She 
was disgusted with her carelessness. 
Scraping the dough from her right 
hand she snatched up the measuring 
cup and hurried out of the door, across 
the yard to her next door neighbor. 

"May I borrow a cupful of raisins, 
Martha?" she asked, as she faced Mrs. 
Chapman, elbow deep in the dish-pan. 

"That you may. Is it raisin loaf 
today?" she asked, as she wiped her 
hands on her gingham apron as^ she 
walked to the cupboard for the jar. 
"Don't bother about measuring. Take 
the jar and use what you like." 

"I'll only want a cupful as I'm bak- 
ing election cake. It's for Mrs. Jessup. 
She is seventy years old today." Mary 
could have slapped herself as she felt 
the hot blood rise to her face. She felt 
Martha Chapman's keen eyes on her 
as she filled the cup heaping full of 
the rich fruit. "I thought I'd surprise 
her with a birthday cake." 

"I suppose you'll use those new Bos- 
ton tubes for the icing. You beat the 
Dutch for fussing," Martha called af- 
ter her as she slipped through the hole 
in the side fence. 

"What are you doing up there, Pum- 
pernill?" Mary exclaimed, as she en- 
tered the kitchen and spied her sleek 
black cat perched contentedly on the 
little kitchen shelf. Pumpernill just 
opened his yellow eyes lazily and 
looked at his mistress a moment, then 
closed them again and settled himself 
for a nap. 

Mary poured alternate layers of the 
spicy dough over the raisins until the 
pan was a little more than half full; 



then placed it on the warming shelf 
with another pan over it. 

Mrs. Jessup was knitting by the sit- 
ting-room window when Mary Lydell 
all smiles pushed the door open and 
entered. 

"I rapped, but as no one seemed to 
hear I thought you might be away 
from home and I could leave my pack- 
age," Mary said apologetically, feeling 
a little embarrassed under the scruti- 
nizing eyes of Mrs. Jessup. 

"Well, Mary Lydell, you are a 
stranger. Whatever brought you here 
today?" 

"Your birthday," answered Mary as 
she placed her package on the center 
table and commenced to unwrap the 
snowy napkin. 

Mrs. Jessup looked up rather sur- 
prised. She was pleased, nevertheless, 
that Mary had not forgotten her birth- 
days, although she refused to * allow 
Betsy, the hired help, to remind her of 
them with "fussing." 

"Yes, I remember how you used to 
like my election cakes," Mary con- 
tinued, as she carried the confection to 
Mrs. Jessup and placed the dish in her 
upturned hands. 

**My goodness, Mary Lydell, it looks 
like a weddin* cake. How did you 
ever do it?" Mrs. Jessup asked as she 
feasted her eyes on the billowy icing, 
crimped and fluted in snowy miniature 
drifts over the round form. In the 
cavity made by the pan tube was 
placed a cluster of Martha Washing- 
ton geranium blossoms. 

"Jessica Killip sent me a set of pip- 
ing tubes from Boston and I have been 
spending my spare moments making 
frills and waves like those on Ellen 
Spencer's wedding cake. I thought I'd 
surprise you with one of my election 
cakes dressed up like a wedding cake. 
I hope it is as good as it looks," Mary 
added. 

Mrs. Jessup assured her that there 
was no doubt about it. Everybody in 



MRS. JESSUP'S BIRTHDAY CAKE

Bethel knew that Mary Lydell never 
failed with her cakes and pies, without 
which no social or sale was complete 
or a success. 

"Shall I give it to Betsy to put 
away?" Mary asked, to hide her con- 
fusion at this compliment. It had 
been so many months since she and 
Mrs. Jessup had met and visited that 
it seemed like beginning anew to be 
acquainted. Mary tried to feel at ease, 
but there seemed to be a slight strain 
on both the women's part, although 
Mrs. Jessup urged Mary to remove her 
hat and coat and sit down awhile. 
Mrs. Jessup also refused to allow 
Betsy to be called. 

"I'll attend to putting it away. I 
want to feast my eyes on it awhile," 
Mrs. Jessup added as she held it up 
again to inspect the decorations. Men- 
tally she added that Mary certainly 
did keep her looks wonderfully well 
for a woman of thirty-five. She also 
noted how becoming to Mary's brown 
hair and eyes was the brown cloth suit 
and hat, the pink lining and wings of 
the latter just matching the pink in 
Mary's cheeks. She wondered what 
Mary would say, if she told her of an- 
other surprise which had come to her 
that very morning. She did not dare 
to tell her, yet she wished she might. 

"You won't stay away so long, 
Mary. The days have been somewhat 
lonely since Ralph went away. There's 
plenty of company such as it is," Mrs. 
Jessup said, a touch of pathos in her 
voice. "It isn't like your own. I've 
always looked on you as my own." 

Mary's face flushed at the mention 
of Ralph's name. But when Mrs. Jes- 
sup spoke of her being one of her own, 
she nervously pushed her hat to one 
side, then straightened it again. 

"Yes, I'll come again. I've been 
somewhat busy with Mrs. Koppel. 
She's had rheumatism so badly and 
there's no one to look after her, you 
know. I go there every day to help 
her a bit. But I'll run in often to see 



you." Mary added, a pleased look 
comilig into her eyes as they rested on 
the slight form of Mrs. Jessup. As 
she closed the door behind her, Mrs. 
Jessup called Betsy, who raised her 
hands in astonishment as she viewed 
the cake. 

"My, but where did you get th' wed- 
din' cake?" she queried, placing her 
elbows akimbo in admiration. 

"It isn't a wedding cake. It's my 
birthday cake. Mary Lydell baked it." 

"Umph," puffed Betsy, raising her 
nose in disdain. "Whatever possessed 
her to bake a cake today for you? 
Don't suppose she knows he's comin*?" 

Mrs. Jessup shook her head. "No 
one knows that but you and me. Mary 
used always to bake election cake for 
my birthdays. We'll cut it for sup- 
per," she added as she passed the loaf 
to Betsy. 

"Then we won't have that yellow 
sponge ?" asked Betsy anxiously as she 
turned to leave the room. SHe had 
put in an hour earlier that morning to 
concoct one of her famous yellow 
cakes for this occasion and she was 
disappointed that Mary Lydell should 
"butt in," she mentally declared to her- 
self. Her spirits arose when Mrs. Jes- 
sup answered that they would have 
both. "And take the flowers out of 
the cake so they will keep fresh for 
tonight when you serve the cake," she 
added. 

At six o'clock Ralph Jessup, whose 
coming home was a secret between his 
mother, Betsy and himself, sat down 
for the first time in two years with 
his mother to enjoy a "real, homey 
meal," he explained. 

"I'm so glad that you were willing 
to keep my coming a secret, mumsy. 
I'll have to be oflf early in the morning 
and I wanted this brief time with you 
and without the whole town calling in 
tonight," the big, bronzed-faced man 
declared as he helped his mother to 
her chair. 

Mrs. Jessup nodded and smiled on 



20

her boy as she poured out the fragrant 
orange pekoe into two of her best 
gold-banded cups. "That suits me. 
And Betsy is just as jealous of your 
short stay as I so that not a soul 
knows you are here. Your disguise is 
complete with that beard. Your best 
friend would never guess who you 
are." So excited was this mother that 
she could not eat, but found satisfac- 
tion in watching the creamed potatoeSi 
pink ham, sliced thin as a wafer, and 
flaky biscuits disappear down her 
boy's hungry throat. 

"It seems bully, mumsy, to get 
home-cooking again after existing on 
hotel fodder for two years. Two years 
— it don't seem so long, mother, does 
it?" 

Mrs. Jessup's eyes filled with mois- 
ture as she answered that it seemed 
like a hundred. Then as her son 
reached for another biscuit she added 
that he must save room for the cake. 
"It's election cake, Ralph." 

The man dropped the biscuit and 
smacked his lips like a boy as he re- 
peated eagerly, "election cake. Hookey? 
mother, I haven't tasted one since I 
left here." Then jokingly he called at 
the top of his voice, "Betsy, bring on 
your cake," again smacking his lips 
in anticipation of the tidbit as Betsy 
appeared, bearing on one upturned 
hand a plate of golden squares of 
sponge cake, the other holding the 
election cake, which she reached to- 
ward Ralph, who stared at it in won- 
derment. 

"It looks like a wedding cake., 
mumsy. Where did you get such a 
fluffy rufHe? Start up your wedding 
march, Betsy," he added as he lifted 
the plate to the table, and all three 
joined in a hearty laugh at his timely 
jokes. 

"That's my birthday cake," Mrs. 
Jessup announced emphatically, as her 
son lifted the cake knife and pushed it 
carefully through the creamy billows 



of icing; then lifted a generous piece 
upon a plate for his mother. 

"Betsy has outdone herself, this 
time," he answered as he picked out 
the cluster of geraniums to lay beside 
the section. He did not notice the mo- 
tion of silence which Mrs. Jessup made 
to Betsy, as the latter was about to 
correct the impression that she was the 
author of the wonderful concoction. 
Then Mrs. Jessup added hastily : 

"No, no. You keep the bouquet. 
Pin them on your coat. I can see them 
better there." 

Between a running comment on how 
good things tasted; how great the 
pleasure to be home once more, and 
what a treasure Betsy was, the slice 
of cake soon vanished. 

"May I, mother?" he asked, balanc- 
ing the knife over the cake as he 
looked at the beaming face across the 
table, knowing what her answer would 
be. 

"All of it, if you wish." 

"It's too bad to be a greedy boy and 
eat all of your birthday cake." He 
lifted the section to his mouth. "This 
is the only way to enjoy election cake, 
mumsy. You can eat any old kind of 
cake with a fork, but not this." He 
bit off a generous piece from the point. 
He chewed a moment on the spicy 
mixture, then a queer expression 
spread across his face. He stopped 
chewing suddenly, clutched his jaw 
and putting the slice of cake down 
picked something from between his 
lips and held it toward the lamp. 

"What is it? A tooth?" anxiously 
enquired his mother. 

Ralph scrutinized the object more 
closely; then answered: "No, it's a 
ring." He wiped the moist crumbs from 
the object to examine it to better advan- 
tage. His face clouded. He knit his 
brows into an angry scowl and the blood 
surged over his face as he recognized the 
ring. These signs passed unnoticed by 
his mother as she exclaimed : 

"A ring! Then it's for mc. Mary

must have intended a double surprise 
for me." 

"Mary I Mary who ?" Ralph pretended 
to be much surprised as he questioned 
his mother, who was smiling with joy 
at this latest addition of joy to her 
birthday surprises, and was holding out 
her hand for the ring. As she realized 
that she had given away a secret which 
she had warned Betsy to keep, she 
dropped her hands in her lap and faintly 
answered that it was Mary Lydell. 

"She made the cake and brought it 
over to surprise me this morning. I 
never was so taken back in my life when 
she walked in on me as I sat knitting. 
I hadn't seen her for months, excepting 
across the street." Mrs. Jessup did not 
know why she should excuse herself for 
getting surprised. 

"Did she know that I was coming?" 

"Oh, no, no," Mrs. Jessup hastily as- 
sured her son. "We have guarded it as 
secret as the grave. But what's the mat- 
ter," she asked anxiously as she noticed 
something queer about her son's face. 

Instead of replying he stretched across 
the table to place the ring in her hand. 
She remembered it. She had assisted 
her son to select it during a visit at Bos- 
ton, and she had seen it many times on 
Mary Lydell's third finger of her left 
hand. She had selected the ring on ac- 
count of the little cluster of for-get-me- 
nots of pearls sunk in the center of the 
purple stone. Quick to sense the situa- 
tion she laid the ring beside her plate. 

"It is a mistake, Ralph. It isn't meant 
for me. It slipped from her finger 
when she mixed the cake. You don't 
stir election cake. You mix it with your 
hand." 

Early the next morning Mary Lydell 
was searching the kitchen for her ame- 
thyst ring. She remembered taking it 
from her finger and placing it on the 
shelf before she mixed her bread so 
she could not have baked it in the loaves. 
That is the last she realized seeing it. 
At the present moment, she was down 



on all fours beside the kitchen range 
feeling along the mopboard for a stray 
knothole in which it might have rolled, 
if she had been careless when putting 
it on the shelf. 

"Let me help you." 

Mary backed awkwardly from behind 
the range. She was never nervous, but 
it was surprising to have a deep bass 
voice sound so near one, and in such an 
embarrassing position to meet a stranger. 
She raised herself to her knees beforq 
she was able to look up at the intruder 
who had opened the kitchen door and 
entered, unannounced. 

"Mercy! Gracious 1" She recognized 
thos^ deep-set gray eyes looking at her. 
She knew the mouth was smiling at her 
discomfiture, although it was hidden 
with the mustache and beard. "Why, 
where did you come from?" She tried 
to rise to her feet but sank back in a 
sitting position. Her face reddened be- 
neath his gaze ; then it paled. The man 
towered above her and she saw his eyes 
twinkle as he asked : 

"You were looking for something? 
May I help you?" Down on his knees 
beside her he went before she had an 
opportunity to protest. 

"A ring. I baked a cake for your 
mother yesterday and took off my ring. 
I haven't seen it since. I must have 
dropped it on the floor." Her embar- 
rassment was pitable. Ralph Jessup en- 
joyed it. 

"Was it a valuable one?" he asked, 
making a pretense of searching for it, 
but keeping his eyes on her face. 

"I was very fond of it. It was — a 
friend gave it — it — " Mary stopped as 
her voice choked. She was angry at 
herself for being so upset and before 
him, too. What if he should find it af- 
ter all these admissions! 

Ralph Jessup had managed to bring 
himself close beside her. "Mary, is this 
it?" He opened his closed hand and 
showed her the missing ring. She 
reached for it. 

"Where did you find it?" Her voice 



22 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



was filled with astonishment, but she 
fairly wilted as he replied: 

"In my portion of mother's birthday 
cake you baked." 

They gazed at each other a second; 
then Mary began to laugh, which re- 
lieved the situation. 

"Pumpernill did it. He knocked it in-, 
to the dough when I was at Martha 
Chapman's for the raisins." Mary was 
still holding out her hand for the ring. 
Ralph lifted it from his palm with hip 
thumb and finger of the other hand. 

"Have you worn it ever since?" 

Mary knew what he referred to. She 



dropped her eyes beneath his earnest 
gaze. The pink flowed into her face, 
then became red. 

"May I place it in its rightful place 
agam ? 

For an answer Mary lowered all her 
fingers but the third one of her left 
hand. Ralph Jessup grasped the hand 
and lifted it to his lips, then slipped the 
ring in place. 

"I was to blame, Mary," he whispered 
in her ear as he pressed her closely to 
him. "That wasn't a birthday cake, 
sweetheart, I knew it was a wedding 
cake." 



The Hardworkers* Monument 



By Madeleine Burrage 



IT'S funny, but it never struck me as 
bein' the least bit odd or out o' the 
way, our moniment, I mean, till the 
other day Miss Parker, she's my sum- 
mer boarder, an' the most elegant young 
lady, she come in an' she says, "Well, 
for New England quaintness, commend 
me to this town I" 

"What now?" I says, real amiable, 
bein' used to city folks. 

"Why," she says, "that monument 
down in the square that says on it. 'To 
All the Hard-Workers in This Village 
Who Have Never Got Any Credit'!" 

"Oh," I says, "you mean that!" An' 
then I had to tell her all about it. 

You see, it was this way. Leily Pow- 
ers had always run our village from the 
word go, so when she up an' died all of 
a sudden last fall, an' we was cut off 
from our guidin' light, so to speak, we 
had an awful dazed an* left-behind 
feelin' for a while. An' then, gradual- 
like, it was borne in upon us that we'd 
ought to do somethin' real big for her, 
to show how high we held all she'd done 
for us. So after a good deal o' backin' 
an' fillin', we pitched on a moniment, to 



be set up down in the square, right in 
the middle, so's it shouldn't be no nearer 
one store than the other. An' we had 
Steve Plummer an' Job Perkins down on 
their knees in the road with their whole 
stock o' yard-sticks, all het up, measurin' 
for fear one of 'em would get it an inch 
his way! 

Some wanted a boss trough, 'cause 
they said it was useful an' an honor, too, 
but the rest of us stood firm for a plain 
moniment, bein' as they always look 
more elegant an' expensive jest because 
they ain't no earthly use to a livin' soul ! 
An' besides, the boss trough didn't seem 
what you might call awful appropriate, 
since Leily'd always been skeered blue o' 
bosses. 

So in the end the others come over an' 
we sent off to the granite works for the 
stone. It was to be jest square an' plain 
like you see, an' the letterin' was to be 
put on after it got here. There were 
folks that wanted everything done dowii 
to the works, but I said no, there ought 
to be some home talent, as you might 
say, connected with it, an' Elmer Stev- 
ens was jest the man for the job. His

cuttin' IS always neat an' creditable, even 
if his real genius does run toward sign- 
paintin'. 

Well, it come home, an' then things 
begun to get lively. Everybody thought 
up a different piece to put on that mon- 
iment, an' everybody thought his was 
far-an'-away the best. Mis' Snow hit 
on "Gone but Not Forgotten" an* stuck 
there. Mis' Perkins wanted "Our Leily !" 
with an exclamation point, which give 
Maylo Pease the idee for "Noble Wom- 
an ! !" with two exclamation points 1 An' 
Deacon Plummer wrote a thirty-nine 
verse poem beginning' 

"Why is this moniment here, under the 

sun and the showers? 
To show to our children, dear, what a 

woman was Leily F. Powers!" 

which he said he thought could be got 
on with a little crowdin'. 

Things jest capered from bad to 
worse, till, finally, it come to me the best 
thing to do was to have only her name 
an' underneath a list o' the things she'd 
done for the village. So I told my Hi- 
ram to suggest it some night down to 
the store, an' then, if it met with favor, 
to call a meetin' of the whole village, 
an' all make out that list together. 

Which he done, an' on the evenin' ap- 
pinted, at the stroke of seven, we was 
there in a body. Amos Emery persided. 
He set up on the platform with a little 
table, an' a drink o' water, an' paper an' 
pencil, all ready to write down whatever 
we said. We'd decided beforehand that 
we'd begin way back at the beginnin' an' 
work up orderly, but we was all sort o' 
hazy 'bout what happened twenty or 
thirty years ago, so things went sort o' 
slow at first. 

Mis' Plummer offered the Organizin' 
of the Church Choir, which Leily done 
when we was jest young things, an', I 
declare, if we didn't get to gossipin' 
'bout what a good time we used to have 
practisin', till we clean forgot what we 
was gathered for. But Amos under- 
stood his business, an* called out "Or- 



der I" real loud, an' we started again. 

Mis' Stone put in Organizin' the 
Sewin' Circle that Leily always said was 
for the amelioration o' the tiresomeness 
o' damin' by yourself, an' Mis' Snow 
remembered how she planned out 
Sprucin' up Round the Station, with a 
little grass an' a flower bed. 'Twas 
wonderful what a difference it made, an' 
I've always hoped the sight was grateful 
to them hot dusty summer travelers. I 
took down a sweet-william root, I recall, 
'specially for the children; they like 
bright things so. 

Well, after that, idees begun comin' 
thick an' fast, an' Amos was kep' a- 
writin' so hard that his arm was lame 
for more'n a week, an' had to be rubbed 
with boss liniment every night. Things 
jest sang, till somebody suggested the 
Raisin' o' Money for Books for the 
School House, by havin' a fair for the 
city folks to come to, an' at that I see 
Mis' Holcomb squirm, but she didn't say 
nothin', an' it went on till my Hiram 
mentioned Gettin' the Church Carpet. 
At that Myra White riz right up an' she 
says, all pink, "I'm the last person," she 
says, "to want to take away credit from 
the dead, but," she says, "Leily Powers 
never had any finger in that affair. All 
she done was to sail in an' get the praise, 
an' I was glad enough for her to have 
it, heaven knows! But," she says, "it 
don't seem quite right to let it be put on 
everlastin' granite!" An' down she sat. 
But no sooner had she done so than up 
riz Maylo Pease. "I never should 'a' 
mentioned it," she says, all of a tremble, 
"but for Myra. But," she says, "this 
is the way the Village Improvement 
come about. Leily an' a lot of us was 
up to her house one day when she says, 
This town is a disgrace! Somethin' 
ought to be done! It needs its hair 
combed and its face washed!' Well, I 
went home an' thought, an' the next day 
I talked it over with others, an' in the 
afternoon we went over to Leily's an' 
says 'Let's have a Village Improvement 
Society, an' you be president.' 'All

right/ she says, 'an' I appint Maylo to 
look after things 1' Which I done, an' 
was real pleased to have her let me. 
But that's how it was, an' now I ain*t 
sure — ^there, I wish I hadn't said any- 
thing!" she says. 

But she had. An' then it did seem as 
if everybody was on their feet to once. 
They'd all thought o 'somethin'I Amos 
was kep' a-crossin' out an' a-puttin' in 
till he didn't know where he was at, an' 
in the excitement he tipped over his 
drink, an' he got all wore out ! 

Finally, I got up an' I says, "Now 
let's calm down. Amos, you read your 
list, an' then we'll see what we've left 
out or o-mitted an' put it in q%Aet!" 

Amos, he riz, tried to take a drink but 
there wan't none left after the catas- 
trophe, cleared his throat, looked the 
paper over front an' back, an' looked 
again. 

"Don't be bashful, Ame," sings out 
someone. 

"I ain't," says he, real cold. "The 
trouble is, there ain't anything here but 
what you've crossed out!" 

Now wan't that difficult? We didn't 
know what to do. We jest sort o' sat 
an' pondered, and gradual-like it dawned 
on us that we'd been taken in, managed ! 



First, I was mad, an' then it come to me 
how Leily must 'a' spent her life laughin' 
up her sleeve. We'd done the work 
and made her a present o' the credit 1 

There wan't no more to that meetin', 
but we had another the next night. There 
was the moniment on our hands. We 
didn't like to send it back an' be the 
laughin' stock o' the whole county, an' 
yet what could we do with it? That was 
where some o' the hoss-trough folks 
came in real disagreeable. 

Two or three days passed, an' then I 
had my inspiration. I reasoned it this 
way. We'd gotten the moniment for 
Leily, because we thought she'd done so 
much for us. Findin* she hadn't, why 
shouldn't we keep it for ourselves? 
We'd done all the work, an' never got a 
speck o' credit yet. Why shouldn't we 
have that moniment as such? 

Lots o' folks disapproved, o' course, 
at first, but in the end they come around. 
I made up the words for it myself, "To 
All the Hard- Workers in This Village 
Who Have Never Got Any Credit," an' 
I can't help feelin' it's for Leily, too, in 
a way, because she may have worked 
hard, unbeknownst to us, an' we cer- 
tainly ain't givin' her no credit; we are 
treating all alike. 



A Poetical Laundress 

The moon, a tub of yellow gold, 
Is hrimmed with sparkling suds, 

And, tossed in heaps across the sky 
Like careless fairies' duds, 

The little clouds are strewn about — 

I wish that I might wash them out. 

I'd have a dainty washboard made 

Of amber sunset bars, 
A basket, draped with silver gauze, 

And edged with evening stars. 
And gaily, in my lunar tub. 
The fleecy cloud-clothes I would rub. 

With gentle hand I'd rinse them well 

In waves of crystal dew. 
And blue them lightly with a mist 

Of palest harebell hue; 
Then, evenly along the sky, 
I'd spread them, fresh and sweet, to dry.

Neighborhood Clubs 



By Luellen Bussenius 



FOR dwellers in the suburbs and 
small country towns, a neighbor- 
hood club is a veritable blessing 
in disguise. While it is true that many 
people like solitude, and do not favor or 
encourage neighborly calls, and "running 
in at the back door," yet the little club 
of co-residents must not in any wise be 
confused with anything of this kind. 
For in many clubs of this type, organ- 
ized for the object of lessening the lone- 
liness of dull days, to give a bit of en- 
tertainment to the monotony of house- 
work, or to afford some instruction in 
studies, it frequently happens that the 
members see each other only on those 
rare, looked-forward-to days of meeting. 
Solitude is not always the best medi- 
cine for tired nerves. Even Bacon said 
that "He who prefers solitude is either 
God or beast." One surely does become 
dull from lack of exchange of ideas, if 
about nothing better than to plan some- 
thing in the household. It is contact 
with personality, with other natures, that 
brightens the intellect, as it is assuredly 
the humor of some one else that cheers 
one up. And what with the hum-drum 
routine of everyday work in the house, 
in which a woman's work is merely 
stopped at night, but never done, we all 
need that ineffable little process of 
"cheering up." And it is from others 
that we must get it, for unfortunately 
one cannot always perform the miracle 
in oneself. 

The Neighborhood Club may meet if 
for no other purpose than to invite its 
members to bring their darning, and 
while performing the monotonous task, 
to be entertained with social chat. Or 
once in a while the meeting may be va- 
ried by a modest little card party, or a 
musicale. If the hostess does not wish 
to spend even the small amount on re- 
freshments, it may be made a "Dutch 



treat," each member contributing her 
quarter or her share of the food. Such 
a slight tax is never objected to. 

Such affairs, however, must be deter- 
mined by the hostess herself. The Club 
should make no pretentions other than 
to offer a comfortable cheerful afternoon 
at one of its member's homes. Its sim- 
plicity and lack of attempt to make it 
elaborate are its main requirements, and 
it should indeed be a "neighborhood" in- 
formal meeting of its members. 

Perhaps if one of the members reads 
well, she could give added pleasure by 
reading some pretty story aloud, or pos- 
sibly a tale of travel. Or, the musical 
member can always add greatly to the 
entertainment. It need not be much, but 
each brings its little ray for the "cheer- 
ing" up. 

Many women grow dejected and mo- 
rose through family cares, sickness and 
excessive household tasks. We often 
hear the expression, "Oh, women are al- 
ways complaining," but we do not al- 
ways think of how few of these women 
ever "give up" and leave their duties un- 
done. For a woman's limitations of en- 
durance surpass all understanding, and 
even when really ill, the whirl of the 
household duties leave her no time to 
realize how badly she feels. A "day off" 
through the week, or fortnight, is better 
than a doctor's prescription, for such a 
change and rest tones up the mind as 
well as the body. If women would try 
this plan, dismissing from their minds all 
thoughts of the petty worriments of their 
homes, and start out on their holiday 
with a mind clear and free, and open for 
new impressions, there would be fewer 
"complaining" women in the world. 

The Neighborhoood Club is the open 
arena for many perplexities, and for 
numerous theories. Perhaps there is 
fancy work one likes to work on at odd

times, (darning may be thought too sug- 
gestive of its accompanying tasks at 
home). If so, take the bit of embroid- 
ery along, knowing all the time that the 
work does not need to be accomplished 
in a certain number of hours, and that 
you can lazily take your time. And be 
sure that your mental attitude is right 
to start with, for if you feel like a cul- 
prit stealing a holiday, you will lose all 
the pleasure in listening to the small 
news of the community, as well as the 
plans of friends and the helpful hints in 
their many suggestions. 

Perhaps a popular book may be pur- 
chased by each member paying a pro- 
portionate share, and in turn, as might 
be determined by drawing, each could 
read it aloud at home within a given pe- 
riod, the same as with a library book. 
Finally, when all have finished its peru- 
sal, the author's work may afford de- 
lightful discussion for one of the club 
meetings. 

So much the better, if some of the 
members possess a Victrola or piano- 
player, whereby an impromptu concert 
can be given. And for the sake of in- 
struction, a brief sketch of the singer or 
composer's life may be read. For while 
we may each pride ourselves on know- 
ing something of the lives of all celebri- 
ties, when it comes down to the point, 
it would be hazy, for these poor brains 
of ours are crowded with a nondescript 
collection of good and bad things. And 
it IS chiefly by repetition that one re- 
members. 

The Neighborhood Club takes on its 
atmosphere from its location. If it is in 
a mall town, its outlook is more or less 
limited, yet it can bring in news of the 
outside world, and help its members over 
many a thorny path in the days of trib- 
ulation and annoyances. Enlivening the 
week as it does, it strengthens one anew 
for other combats, and gives new vigor 
and strength with which to meet burdens. 

If the club is formed amid suburbs, its 
character grows more or less cosmopoli- 
tan, in proportion to its nearness to the 



city. The theme of popular plays be- 
comes the topic for afternoon meetings ; 
little theatre parties are formed to go 
and see the play, perhaps for one meet- 
ing. If the gods are propitious, the hus- 
bands are included, and the diversion 
takes place at night, with, perhaps, a 
dinner before. 

Again, the Neighborhood Club need 
not be necessarily confined to residents 
of one particular portion of the town, 
merely because its name implies that. 
Its membership, is gained, of course, by 
invitation, and to a great extent by con- 
geniality ; for even if many people dwell 
side by side in a community, it does not 
at all indicate any similarity of taste or 
pursuit. 

As a plant unfolds its tiny leaves to 
the warming influence of the sun, people 
generally find in the same inexplicable 
manner others of like desires, and har- 
mony. Like attracts like. A fragmen- 
tary word or so leads to the discovery of 
some strong point in common, and thus 
are friendships founded. While it is all 
very well for the sake of the theorists 
to consider their dictum that people of 
dissimilar temperament should be allied, 
yet one must admit that the average per- 
son prefers one of similar taste, if it is 
only for an outing, or for a brief visit. 
Friends of similar tastes are restful and 
soothing; a temperament of opposite 
polarity arouses only by defence, and in- 
stead of soothing, one is challenged into 
activity. There is no common point of 
understanding, pleasant or otherwise, as 
the case may be, which is not what one 
wants for a quiet hour. 

The members of the Neighborhood 
Club should, therefore, have tastes in 
common, or dissension and strife will 
surely arise, and its purpose be defeated. 
For it must always be remembered that 
its organization is for the purpose of 
neighborly interests and needs, as well as 
for companionship. A member must feel 
that she can, indeed, waive all formality 
and not "dress up" for the occasion. 
She must be free to come and go, free 



NEIGHBORHOOD CLUBS

to speak out her mind, when a question 
arises, as well as to dress as she pleases. 
She would do this in her own home, and 
the club is only a home issue, — a com- 
bination of several homes, where each 
member has a home privilege. 

There are numerous diversions for the 
afternoon as soon as summer arrives. 
If one has a garden, an outdoor meet- 
ing is pleasant. Little tables for sewing 
may be placed cozily under the trees, and 
afterwards be used for serving the re- 
freshments. If the latter are to be served, 
they may be selected from the fruits that 
ripen during the month. With cake and 
iced tea, sherbet or some dainty cooling 
drink, the needs of the "inner man" will 
have been attended to. For be it re- 
membered that on the point of refresh- 
ments many excellent clubs have gone 
astray, and if such are to be considered, 
let it be instituted at the start exactly 
how far, or how little one can do in this 
line. 

Many hostesses do not relish the idea 
of having extra food to prepare, even if 
it is for a club meeting. Especially is 
this true where one has to do her own 
work, and lives far beyond the aid of the 
stores, and other figurative "first aids" 
in the housekeeping line. Again, one 
may not be accustomed to these little 
duties, and hardly knows what to do, or 
how to do it right. Make the task, there- 
fore, as light and easy as possible. One 
cannot fail, if these instructions are fol- 
lowed, for remember that even sand- 
wiches alone, with lemonade, cocoa or 
tea become appetizing under the spirit of 
kindness and good cheer. 



When one has even one friend she is 
most fortunate. If she has more than 
one all the better. Neighborhood Clubs 
form strong ties, and make friends who 
are willing to lend a helping hand . if 
emergencies arise, and they always do 
for the majority of us, no matter in what 
part of the globe one lives. In sickness, 
bereavement and all dark hours there is 
ineffable solace in the ministrations of 
friends and their silent acts of kindness. 

The Neighborhood Clubs fits in incon- 
spicuously into the every day. life of a 
community, disturbing nothing from its 
ordinary routine, merely checking the 
wheels of the household for an occa- 
sional pleasant afternoon. It takes noth- 
ing from its members and its return is 
invaluable ; for it gives friends and cheer 
and offers escape from lonely hours and 
dull thoughts. Best of all in its miracle- 
working does its subtle power extend be- 
yond physical boundaries, giving medi- 
cine to the mind and to the soul. 

Some women living in isolated places 
almost forget how to laugh, or how to 
take even small doses of enjoyment. 
Perhaps the nearest neighbor lives miles 
away, — a several hours' journey. If so, 
all the more reason for starting a club 
for making the acquaintance of other 
lonely women in the vicinity. Exchange 
books, plants ideas, words of cheer, and 
remember, what you give some one else 
gives back to you in multiple form. Best 
of all, the touch of a friend's hand is 
worth far more than the unreckoned 
count of a hundred acquaintances. That 
is one reason why I am so enthusiastic 
over the Neighborhood Club idea ! 



Transmutation 

A grain of sand in an oyster's shell 
That it couldn't eject, so it covered it well 
With a precious coat which we call a gem, 
And deem it fit for a diadem. 

A bit of care that the heart lends space — 
That love cannot escape, but can outwardly 

grace 
With such royal beauty till all the world 
May see how a care can be empearled.

Suggestions on The Artistic Use of HousefumisKings 



By Minnie C. Anderson 



IN dealing with the artistic treatment 
of housefurnishings, the two essen- 
tial elements are simplicity and in- 
dividuality. The modern house of today 
is apt to be overcrowded with a same- 
ness of furniture, bought because in 
fashion, and with no meaning for your 
particular home. You admire the glass 
cabinet in your friend's large dining 
room; don't think you need one in your 
small dining room; you need the space 
much more. 

Fortunately, with the advent of the 
new Wall Papers, with their one and 
two-toned effects, there is less of a pos- 
sibility for unattractive backgrounds for 
pictures and furniture. Papers in the 
olive, brown and gray effects are most 
restful and pleasing to the eye. Green 
is always satisfactory when used in the 
darker tones. Unless you are an artist, 
avoid strong yellow and blue greens, or 
come to grief as I did. Red and blue 
papers require careful handling. A red 
room in a small house will not produce 
the cheerful effect you wish to attain; 
while certain gray papers are beautiful 
in Colonial houses, with broad halls and 
stairway. A small dark hall, or room 
papered in gray, has a cold and most 
depressing effect. The size and height 
of the room (whether dark or sunny), 
and the use to which it is to be put, must 
always be taken into consideration. 

In an old country house which had 
sheltered five generations, additions 
having been built, from time to time, to 
suit the needs or wishes of its occupants, 
was a room called the "Garden Room." 
It extended from east to west, shaded 
on both sides by elms and locust trees, 
opening through a vine-covered porch 
(as its name indicated) into the garden. 
This room was papered in soft yel- 
low, with ivory-white woodwork, rattan 
furniture, one or two smaller pieces 



done over in ivory white; the cushions 
in yellow, the pictures (all water colors) 
framed in simple frames of dull gilt. 
There, life was full of sunshine; you 
felt it, you knew it. 

Another advantage of the one and 
two-toned effects in wall papers, is that 
they do not clash with the many colors 
that are brought out in the beautiful 
Oriental rugs. These rugs are costly, 
and we cannot all have them; then 
choose rugs or carpetings of neutral 
colors or small figures. 

Window draperies add much to the 
home likeness of a room. If one finds 
that the white or ecru lace, or net cur- 
tains, fail to furnish the room as much 
as desired, beautiful effects can be ob- 
tained in overhangings of cretonne, 
damask, and soft silks, which harmonize 
with the wall paper. 

Have you ever noticed a sick person, 
convalescing, wants all the unnecessary 
things removed from the room? They 
tire, not rest, the eye; and a pot of 
ferns, or a blossoming plant, will give 
more real beauty to a room than vases 
or knicknacks. If you have boys, you 
will see, as they grow older, their once 
prized souvenirs, banners and photo- 
graphs (designated as so much "truck") 
are given a general clearing out; a few 
"specials" being retained. We may not 
care to pattern from the Japanese, the 
severe simplicity of their housefurnish- 
ings, but we may learn that overcrowd- 
ing, either in draperies or furniture, 
detracts rather than adds to the attrac- 
tiveness of our homes. 

Young couples of moderate means 
have a greater opportunity of adapting 
their houses to themselves and their 
needs, than those who leave their furn- 
ishings in the hands of a decorator. The 
result may not be as artistic, but it is 
much more suggestive. Their houses

THE HONEYMOON

cannot be furnished, all at once, but a 
piece or two of furniture is added from 
time to time. This, probably, represents 
some thought and self-denial; and the 
purchases becomes an event. If true 
home-builders, they will be careful in 
their selections. 

If one is fortunate in being able to 
travel, and in having money to spend 
(be it much or little), reminders of a 
day's pleasant outing, a city or town 
visited, will be found in odd bits of 
tapestry or embroideries, foreign prints 
and curios, which give a most distinc- 
tive touch to certain rooms. The hall 
is, usually, considered the place for fam- 
ily portraits; yet I have seen living 
rooms, yes, dining rooms, where an old 
portrait, or portraits, owing to the skill 
of the artist, gave the room a dignity 
quite its own. 

If your house is large and you lack 
suitable pictures for so large a room or 
hall, you are safe in choosing a paper 
that furnishes in itself. 

When furnishing a room with old- 
fashioned furniture, do not piece it out 
with modern, yet many a modern room 
owes its attractiveness to the one or two 
heirlooms it contains. 

What shall we do — ^many of us who 
go into homes already furnished and are 
confronted with photographs of the 
family in elaborate frames, wax flowers 



or stuffed birds under glass, marble top 
tables and stuffy dust-collecting chairs? 
We fail to see in them anything of 
beauty; but they are valued by their 
owners, either from association, or 
money-wise. When you suggest the re- 
moval of the photographs to'a less con- 
spicuous place, one often hears "the 
frames cost so much apiece — the wax 
flowers are quite natural, the birds were 
shot by so and so — or it was a pet in the 
family. If you would have your home 
a beautiful one, love and consideration 
for other's feelings, must come first; 
time and tact will do the rest. 

Do you recall the story of the young 
couple who received as a wedding pres- 
ent from a maiden aunt, Rodger's group, 
called **You Dirty Boy" (now used as 
an advertisement for soap). "What 
shall we do with it," was ever the ques- 
tion, for it must always be in evidence, 
lest Auntie should take umbrage. It 
was broken — quite by accident. No one 
knew how ; the pieces were collected and 
put in a box in the tool room. Months 
afterward, the old gardener called the 
mistress to the tool house; and, with a 
face beaming with pleasure, showed her 
the carefully mended group, "with never 
a piece missing ma'am." 

Warning: If, quite by accident, you 
break anything, be careful what you do 
with the pieces.

HEALTH FIRST 

"Health and happiness fulfill the de- 
sires of the average individual," says 
Doctor Joseph Collins, in his "The Way 
with the Nerves." "The former often 
exists without the latter, but a consid- 
erable degree of health is necessary to 
the average individual, if he is to be 
happy. Hence the necessity of avoiding 
those experiences which rob us of it." 
Doctor Collins was discussing the subject 
of alcohol, but what he says is quite as 
true with reference to too much food, 
too much meat, tea, coffee, excessive 
work, injurious clothing, lack of recrea- 
tion — anything, in fact, which steps in 
between the "average individual" and the 
health and the happiness that come from 
good health. 



AN OPPORTUNITY 

THIS is the best number with which 
to begin a new subscription, for 
the magazine year begins with this, the 
June- July issue. Our year ends with the 
May number, which holds a Title Page 
and Complete Index for the year. This 
renders the numbers of each year a very 
valuable cook-book and work of refer- 
ence, and we find it is largely appre- 
ciated. No other culinary publication, of 
which we are aware, maintains this in- 
valuable feature. We point to our sev- 
enteen indexed volumes as a specific 
work with which there is nothing to 
compare. 

Why not begin now a trial subscrip- 
tion of the eighteenth volume? Each 
successive volume, we are sure, is better, 
in every sense, than the preceding. You 
can not fail to find the magazine of in- 
estimable helpfulness in your home. It 
will be well worth preserving. We can 
live without many things, but we can not 
live without food. 

THE BUSINESS OF HOUSE- 
KEEPING 

HOUSEKEEPING is rapidly be- 
coming to be regarded as a pro- 
fession. The conditions of life are such, 
today, that efficiency in the home is a 
necessity. It is now conceded, world- 
wide, that business of every sort must 
be prudently and skilfully conducted, in 
order to avoid inevitable failure and dis- 
aster. Method in household manage- 
ment has become a large factor in gen- 
eral economics. 

A chief occasion for the present high 
cost of living is the -distance between 
producer and consumer. Food products 
are manipulated and exploited too much 
before they reach the larder of the 
housewife. From producer to consumer 
the difference in price of commodities 
has steadily grown to be excessive. The 
time has come, it is well said, for the 
American housewives "to organize for 
educational, constructive and defensive

work for the home." Among other 
things it is up to the housewife today, 
to insist upon sanitary markets and 
cleanliness in the handling of food, to 
demand pure food products of all kinds, 
— products that shall be what they are 
represented to be, to patronize trades- 
men only who comply with the laws, 
and to demand fair prices for all com- 
modities; in short, to work for honesty, 
quality, efficiency and a fair deal for all. 
There is work enough for women, in 
the ways of home-making, profitable, 
beneficial work, provided only that they 
will take advantage of the opportunities 
which are presented to them. We want 
to get into full sympathy and keep up 
with the progressive spirit of the day. 

ECONOMY IN TAXATION 

IT is past all comprehension that our 
legislators and public officials should 
be so dense as not to realize that people 
do not take kindly to increase in rates 
of taxation. As conditions now are, if 
a legislator wishes to misrepresent his 
constituency and become odious, let him 
simply advocate an advance of rates in 
revenues of any sort or description. 
The most glaring and disastrous eco- 
nomic blunder of a generation is the fact 
that, as a people, we have steadfastly set 
our faces towards high instead of low 
tariff. 

It is now nearly fifty years since the 
close of our civil war. High tariff was 
declared a war measure, at the close of 
which a reduction in tariff rates was 
promised. Promises have been made 
since, even pledges to reduce the burden 
have been given. Up to the present 
time, however, we have had little else 
than promises. Instead of a reduction in 
rates of taxation, through pensions, 
implements of. war, etc., etc., our burdens 
have been constantly increasing. Finally 
a tax on incomes is to be imposed, which, 
it is thought, may not be an unjust means 
of raising needful revenues. 

Now people are clamoring for a re- 
vision of the tariff that is, indeed, down- 



ward; and they are ready to submit to 
the result, be it unmixed good or ill. A 
reduction all along the line is called for. 
Taxes, unless they be self-imposed, are 
always odious. Economy is a wise and 
prudent policy to pursue in public as 
well as in private affairs. 

KITCHEN ALCHEMY 

IT is to France chiefly that the world 
owes this invaluable lesson, which 
gives to those of moderate means many 
of the advantages of the well-to-do. In 
that country the humblest peasant fam- 
ily enjoys palatable meals because the 
cook is an alchemist who knows how to 
transmute the baser metals into silver 
and gold. 

The secret of this alchemy lies in the 
use of the stock-pot, which saves for the 
table a vast amount of animal and vege- 
table nutriment and flavor, such as in 
American cities and on American farms 
are wickedly wasted. 

It is no consolation to know that the 
British are almost if not quite as fool- 
ishly wasteful as we are. But they are 
beginning to learn of the French. Sir 
Henry Thompson's "Food and Feeding" 
sounded a note which is being listened to 
more and more attentively. A more re- 
cent writer comments instructively on 
"French Thrift and British Waste" : 

"In a French household such a thing 
as waste is almost unknown. The posi- 
tive waste of odds and ends in this coun- 
try is simply appalling. Look not only 
under the vegetable stalls in our streets, 
but also in almost all dustbins, and you 
will see as much as, if it had been kept 
clean, might have given health literally 
to thousands of people. 

Besides the outside leaves of cabbages 
and cauliflowers, and the outside layers 
of onion skin, there are the peelings of 
potatoes, turnips, carrots, and apples, 
and the tops of beet-roots and turnips, 
and the large outside sticks of celery. 
In France and other countries these go, 
as a matter of course, into the stock-pot. 
In England the stock-pot is scarcely used 



32 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



at all among the poorer people. It is not 
too much to affirm that half a dozen 
changes in the ways of English poor 
people, including first and foremost the 
use of the stock-pot, would increase our 
national prosperity more than our social 
reformers dream of." — Food & Flavor, 



THE MODERN HEROINE 

Not long ago a friend remarked to me, 
apropos of the heroine of "A Woman of 
Genius," that he would have run away 
from that kind of a woman. Very 
likely; he was that kind of a man. 
About the same time I heard an Eng- 
lishman undertake to tell a New York 
audience of quite the better sort that, if 
the ladies insisted on having the vote, 
men would no longer love them, and he 
was received with hilarious groans. The 
remark and the incident brought out for 
me suddenly the extent to which the 
stuffing has fallen out of one of the stock 
bogies with which women used to be 
terrified into good behavior — ^the fear 
that men would no longer find them at- 
tractive. 

What the feminist revolution of the 
past few years has proved for us is that 
men are not so easily frightened away 
from loving as they thought they were 
going to be, and that women bear up 
under their defection much better than 
anybody supposed they would. Follow- 
ing on this discovery has come a change 
in the character of the heroine of fic- 
tion. 

Until within the present generation 
the prime requirement has been that she 
should be a charmer of men. She has 
been ravishingly beautiful, and both the 
hero and the villain were madly in love 
with her ; this demand for the quality of 
the enchantress extended even to the 
villainess, only her charms were of the 
deadly boa-constrictor sort. And she 
must be also unmaried. Even Charlotte 
Bronte, who dared to make Jane Eyre 
both poor and plain, dared not show her 



other than able to draw the masterful 
and caddish Rochester to eat out of her 
hand. 

Perhaps the real cause of the preva- 
lence of the captivating type in fiction is 
accounted for by our all being more or 
less under the obsession that forbids 
women telling the truth about them- 
selves. We are not trained to speak or 
expect the truth, and the most advanced 
of us are still occasionally, by reversion, 
shocked by it. The business of women 
has, for ages, been held to be to please 
men, and men do not really care how 
women feel, but how they make men feel. 
A woman who can not make them feel 
the way they are accustomed and wish 
to feel about her is unwomanly. This 
is the plain definition of that word. Not 
by any particular behavior, but by any 
that gives men sensations at variance 
with their predilections, is woman un- 
sexed. 

She once did it by putting starch in 
her collar, and in some countries she 
does it by going about on her own feet. 
What society has expected of women \% 
not a truthful presentation of herself, 
but an acceptable one. If she hadn't it 
by nature, she must be trained and 
coerced into it. 

We are still half-unconsciously under 
the old racial habit of thinking that, if 
a woman fails to please men, she fails 
in all. 

But just as women of today are aris- 
ing to the call of a thing higher than the 
personal predilection, the call of the 
genius of the race, so the quality of 
heroines will rise with them. They will 
be women fit to be the mothers of men ; 
whether they will also be attractive will 
depend largely on the quality of the men. 
What will astonish the particular man is 
that she will not care so much for his 
opinion, and what will astonish him even 
more is that he will go on marrying her 
just the same, for the genius of the race 
does not care a great deal for private 
opinions, either. — Mary Austin.

Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 



IN all recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the Hour is measured after sifting 
once. Where flour is measured by cupa, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful 
is meant. A tablespoonful or teaspoonful of any designated material is a LGVBL qMonfuI. 



Broiled Sardines 

DRAIN and wipe one or two doz- 
en sardines; let broil in a well- 
oiled broiler two or three min- 
utes, turning each ten seconds. Dis- 
pose on hot slices of toast. Spread the 
sardines with maitre d' Hotel butter or 
pour over them a little cream sauce, A 
cup and a half of cream sauce will be 
enough for two dozen sardines. 

Broiled White Fish, Mackerel and 
Bluefish 
Oil the broiler thoroughly. Do not 
have too fierce a fire, as strong heat 
hardens the fibres very quickly. Cook 
from fifteen to twenty minutes. Baste 
with butter once or twice during the 
cooking. If the fish be thick, the last of 
the cooking might be done over a drip- 
ping pan in the oven. In broiling, turn, 
after cooking the flesh side ten seconds, 
the skin side five seconds. With a fork 



separate the fish from the wires of the 
broiler, on both sides, then slide to the 
serving dish. Spread with maitre d' 
Hotel Butter. 

Maitre d' Hotel Butter 
{For broiled fish, steak or chops) 
Beat one-fourth a cup of butter to a 
cream; beat in half a teaspoonful of 
salt, a dash of pepper and, very slowly, 
a tablespoonful of lemon juice. The 
heat of the broiled article will melt the 
butter. For a change add a tablespoon- 
ful of fine-chopped parsley with the sea- 
sonings. 

Potatoes Maitre d' Hotel 
For half a three or four pound blue- 
fish, broiled, to serve three or four peo- 
ple, cut out between two and three dozen 
potato balls. Let cook until tender in

cup of milk and, when scalded, remove 
to a cooler part of the stove. Have

ready a tablespoonful of creamed butter 
mixed with the yolk of an egg, half a 
teaspoonfnl of salt, a dash of paprika, 
and a tablespoonful of lemon juice; stir 
this into the potatoes. When the sauce 
thickens a little, shake the balls over the 
fire a moment longer. Dispose in a hot 
dish or on the dish around the fish. 
Sprinkle the whole with fine-chopped 
parsley. 

Egg's a la Aurora 
Toast rounds of bread ; dip the edges 
lightly in boiling salted water; spread 
lightly with butter; set a carefully 
poached, fresh egg on each slice; over 
three or four eggs pour a cup of sauce 
made of two tablespoonfuls, each, af 
butter and flour, one-fourth a teaspoon-

once. 

Eggs Baked with Cheese 
Let four eggs, covered with water at 
the boiling point, remain on the stove, 
where the water will keep hot without 
boiling, half an hour; plunge the eggs 
into cold water, and when cold remove 
the shells and cut in thick slices. Have 
ready about six tablespoonfuls of grated 
cheese, and a cup of white sauce made 
with rich milk. Put a layer of the eggs 
into an earthen baking dish and sprinkle 
with cheese ; continue until both the in- 
gredients are used ; pour over the cream 
sauce; sprinkle on half a cup of cracker 
crumbs stirred through two tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter; set into the oven

Eggs, Canada Style 
Select round fresh tomatoes; cut out 
a piece around the stem end of each, and 
remove enough of the seeds and pulp to 
make an opening to hold an egg. Sea- 
son the inside of the tomatoes with salt 
and pepper; break an egg in each. Set 
the tomatoes in an earthen baking dish; 
pour a tablespoonful of white sauce over 
the egg in each tomato. Bake in a very 
moderate oven about fifteen minutes. 
Pour a cup of hot white sauce around

Stuffed Eggs au Gratin 
Pour a quart or more of boiling water 
over six e^s ; let the water boil, then 
cover and draw to a cooler part of the 
range (where the water will not boil), 
to remain half an hour. Let cool in cold 
water; shell and cut in halves, length- 
wise. Remove and sift the yolks. Have 
ready cooked ham. chicken or veal, one 
or more, chopped and pounded to a 
smooth paste. To the yolks, add an

whites of two eggs, beaten dry. Turn 
into a mold lined with slices of banana. 
Squeeze a little lemon jiiice over the 
slices of banana to keep them from dis-

Pineapple Sponge 
Let two cups of grated pineapple and 
half a cup of water simmer ten or fif- 
teen minules, then strain through a 
cheese cloth, pressing out all the juice. 
Reheat the juice and dissolve in it one- 
fourth a package of gelatine, softened 
in one-fourth a cup of cold water, and 
two-thirds a cup of sugar. Let chill in 
a dish of ice and water, then add the 
juice of half a lemon and the whites of 
two eggs, beaten dry, and beat until the 
mixture will hold its shape. Turn into 
a mold. Serve, unmolded, with sugar 
and cream or a boiled custard. 



to thicken, then fold in one cup and a 
half of cream, beaten firm. When the 
mixture will "hold its shape," (when a 
spoonful lifted and returned does not 
run level), turn into a mold. When un- 
molded garnish with some of the fruit 
used in the dish, or leave plain. At this 
season the dish may be made without 
fruit and surrounded with strawberries 
mixed with sugar. 

Almond Meringues with Straw- 
berries and Cream 
Beat the whites of four fresh eggs 
dry; then gradually beat in one cup of 
granulated sugar, and when very firm, 
take a spoon and beat in half a cup or 
more of chopped almonds. Lightly tack 
strips of waxed paper (such as is used 
in wrapping butter. &c.) on to a board 
about one inch in thickness; with an oval

fill the sohd ovals with the meringue 
mixture, making it flat on top. Use a 
pastry bag and plain tube to fill the 
narrow oval shapes ; dredge all with 
granulated sugar. Set the boards into a 
slack oven to let the meringues dry out 
rather than bake. After three-fourths 
an hour increase the heai to color the 
meringues delicately. When baked lift 
from the paper with a spatula. Press 
the soft part of a solid meringue and an 
elongated, ring-shaped meringue to- 
gether, to form a case. Fill these, at 
serving, with whipped cream and 
sugared strawberries. To make in quan- 
tity allow one white of egg and one- 
fourth a cup of sugar for each meringue. 
A cup of cream and half a box of berries 
will fill six. ' -; , 

Strawberry Shortcake 



work in from one-third to one-half a 
cup of shortening; then gradually stir 
in milk as needed to make a dough a lit- 
tle softer than for biscuit. About one 
cup and a half of milk will be needed. 
Spread the dough in two well-buttered 
pans. Bake in a quick oven. Spread 
the bottom of each cake generously with 
butter. Have ready two baskets of ber- 
ries, hulled, washed, cut in halves, and 
mixed with two cups of sugar. Put the 
layers together with berries between, 
above and around. Serve at once. For 
a change, serve with hot marshmallow 
sauce poured over each portion. 

Hot Marshmallow Sauce 

Boil one cup of sugar and half a cup 
of hot water five or six minutes, after 
boiling begins. Do not stif after the 
syrup boils. Remove from the fire ; add

half a pound of marshmallows and beat 
until they are melted. Flavor with half 
a teaspoonful of vanilla, if desired. If 
serving be delayed, keep the sauce hot 
over warm water, then add a few drops 
of hot syrup or boiling water and beat 
again. 

Butter Scotch Pie 

Bake pastry rolled as for pie crust on 
the outside of an inverted pie pan. 
Prick the paste all over and set it on a 
tin sheet to keep the edge from contact 
with the oven. When baked set inside 
the pan, turn in butter-scotch filling and 
cover with a meringue, made of the 
whites of two e^s and one-fourth a 
cup of granulated sugar. Let bake about 
ten minutes. Serve when partly or 
wholly cold. 

Butter Scotch Filling 

Scald one cup of milk tn a double 
boiler; stir three level tablespoon fuls of 
cornstarch and one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of salt with half a cup of cold milk to 
a smooth consistency, then let cook in 
the hot milk, stirring constantly, until 
smooth and thick. Cook two table- 
spoonfuls of butter with one cup of 



brown sugar until the sugar is soft and 
bubbly throughout. Do not cook it to 
caramel. Stir the sugar into the corn- 
starch mixture, then add two yolks of 
eggs, beaten light and diluted with a lit- 
tle of the hot mixture. Use when cooled 
a little. 

Jellied Fish, Ham, etc., with 
Lettuce 

Soften one-fourth a package of gela- 
tine in one-fourth a cup of cold water, 
and dissolve in one cup and a fourth of 
hot, well-seasoned broth. For fish use 
fish or chicken broth ; for ham or corned 
beef use chicken or veal broth. Season 
the broth with carrot, parsley and onion 
— also sweet herbs if desired. Add about 
two cups of cooked ham or corned beef. 
chopped, or the same quantity of cooked 
fish, separated into flakes. Turn into 
molds. Serve unmolded, when cold, with 
lettuce and salad dressing. Cucumbers 
are good with the fish. 

Before filling the molds the letters are 
outlined with the sifted yolk or chopped 
white of a hard-cooked egg. In like 
manner pickles, capers or parsley may be 
used. See page 36.

Boys of 14-16 years require the same amount of food, approximately, as adults leading a 
moderately active life. The character of the food is not very aifferent either, except that stim- 
ulants are forbidden and fried food and pastry, allowed to a limited degree. 

In an institution where numbers are to be served, it would be rather difficult to cut down 
the menus to one or two dishes and appeal to the varying appetites, unless certain foods could 
always be kept on hand and served as substitutes, such as dry cereals, milk, bread and butter, 
crackers, etc.

Keeping WeD in Summer 

By Minnie Genevieve Morse 



IT is a curious fact, but one well 
established, that as one season 
succeeds another there is a charge 
not only in weather conditions, fasli- 
ions, and ways of living, but also in 
the character of the diseases that are 
most prevalent. In the winter a lib- 
eral harvest is reaped by various child- 
ish infections, the spread of which is 
favored by indoor life, defective ven- 
tilation, and the closer herding to- 
gether of humanity, resulting from the 
opening of schools and the resumption 
of church and social activities. Then, 
too, diseases of the respiratory organs 
enjoy their greatest popularity; colds 
of all kinds, grippe, bronchitis and 
pneumonia number their victims by 
scores and hundreds. With the onset 
of warm weather, however, these ail- 
ments, while not entirely disappearing, 
cease to be much in evidence, giving 
place to totally different classes of 
disorders, among which the most 
prominent are those that are largely 
communicated by summer insects, 
those resulting from the rapid decom- 
position of food substances, and those 
produced either by exposure to the 
sun or great heat, or by eating or 
drinking when over-heated. These 
facts once thoroughly understood, the 
indications are plain as to the direction 
to be taken in planning a campaign of 
prevention. 

The war against the house-fly will, 
if continued with unabated energy, un- 



questionably go far to wipe certain in- 
fectious diseases, notably . typhoid fe- 
ver, off the face of the earth. Interest 
in the misdemeanors of the house-fly 
is of recent growth, but no one who 
once realizes that the average number 
of germs clinging to the legs of a sin- 
gle fly has been estimated at 1,250,000, 
that many more taken into his diges- 
tive tract pass through as active and 
virulent as before, and that he is 
equally attracted by food ready for 
the table and by filth of the worst de- 
scription, passing often directly from 
one to the other, will ever willingly 
tolerate the presence of flies in kitchen 
or living rooms. Flies travel much 
further than is generally known, and 
it is beyond question that many of the 
cases of infectious disease that appear 
mysteriously, and cannot be traced to 
any exposure on the part of the pa- 
tient, are communicated by these sum- 
mer pests. 

The various forms of malarial fever, 
which were formerly supposed to be 
due to the "bad air" of certain locali- 
ties, and especially to nocturnal ex- 
posure to it, are now known to be 
communicated by, and only by, a cer- 
tain variety of mosquito. The germs 
are not carried about on the insect's 
body, as are the germs of typhoid fe- 
ver, tuberculosis and infantile diar- 
rhoea by the housefly, but within it; 
the micro-organism causing malaria 
goes through a portion of its life cycle 



46 



KEEPING WELL IN SUMMER 



47 



inside the body of the mosquito. A 
case of malaria can only be produced 
by the bite of a mosquito which has 
previously bitten a patient suffering 
from the same form of the disease. 

War to the death against house-fly 
and mosquito, then, is one of the first 
essentials for the prevention of illness 
in summer. Careful screening of doors 
and windows will accomplish much in 
keeping both flies and mosquitoes out 
of the house, but in neither case is it 
a suflicient protection. Where malaria 
is known to exist, screened verandas 
are necessary for safe out-door life, 
especially in the evenings, when mos- 
quitoes are most troublesome, and if, 
in spite of care, mosquitoes are found 
in the house, it is best to protect the 
beds by netting. A net covering for 
the baby's carriage is needed even 
where there is no malaria to be 
dreaded. Devices to exclude mos- 
quitoes are of course equally effective 
in keeping out flies, but as the latter 
are many times more numerous than 
the former, and are most active during 
daylight, when the constant opening 
and closing of doors gives them 
greater opportunity of access to the 
house, further measures are necessary. 
A screened-in back porch, containing 
near the outer door one of the many 
varieties of fly-traps, is very effective 
in preventing flies from entering the 
kitchen. Fly traps and fly papers can 
also be used inside the house, if they 
are kept out of the way of babies and 
pet animals, but the most effectual 
way of dealing with flies within-doors 
is by a faithful use of the "fly-swatter." 
House-flies multiply with startling 
rapidity, and in matters of this sort 
eternal vigilance is the price of safety. 
Furthermore, the war against both the 
fly and the mosquito must not be con- 
fined to preventing their access to the 
house and destroying them when 
there, but must be carried into the 
enemy's country, the outer world. 
Uncovered rain barrels and other 



standing water, which are favorite 
breeding places for mosquitoes, should 
be carefully screened, while garbage 
pails, which will quickly call myriads 
of flies, should be thoroughly cleansed 
on the outside, tightly closed, and if 
possible provided with one of the fly- 
traps recently devised for the purpose. 
Out-door privies should be equipped 
with modern sanitary provisions 
against the entrance of flies. Chicken 
houses, stables, and out-buildings gen- 
erally should be frequently cleansed 
and whitewashed. It is true that such 
precautionary measures cost a certain 
amount of money, time, and trouble, 
but one serious illness in the house- 
hold will eat up far more of all three. 
Another very common cause of ill- 
ness in summer is the eating of food 
in which putrefactive changes have be- 
gun to take place. It is not always 
possible, when one is traveling, living 
in hotels, or visiting in other people's 
houses, to know much regarding the 
source of the food supply, but the 
housekeeper who herself doe^ the or- 
dering for the family, and keeps watch 
over the condition of ice-box and pan- 
try, can to a very large extent prevent 
the occurrence of the poisoning acci- 
dents of which one hears so frequently, 
and which often result so tragically. 
It may be a temptation to the econom- 
ical housewife to buy of the butcher 
whose meat is a few cents less a pound 
than at the highly recommended mar- 
ket in the next block, but she will do 
well to make sure of the quality of 
his wares, especially in summer, when 
the out-door temperature does not fur- 
nish a natural cold-storage system 
to preserve questionable food. The 
tradesman who is known to conduct 
his business in the most up-to-date 
and sanitary manner is the safest man 
to deal with, even if one must buy 
meat a little less frequently. A close 
watch over the way in which supplies 
are cared for, after arrival at the 
house, is also necessary, for many 



48 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



kinds of food can deteriorate very rap- 
idly in a hot kitchen. Moreover, there 
are certain articles of which one 
should be especially suspicious in hot 
weather, and among these fish holds 
prominent place. At the seaside, 
along trout streams, and in other lo- 
calities where the time between the 
catching of the fish and its appearance 
on the table is very short, nothing 
can be nicer than this kind of food for 
the summer table; but where this is 
not the case it is wiser to omit it alto- 
gether from the menu in very warm 
weather. 

Fortunately for the housekeeper, her 
family are really better off with a 
diminished supply of protein, and es- 
pecially of the red meats, during the 
hot months, and the abundant summer 
fruits and vegetables can take a lead- 
ing place in the bill of fare. Even 
these, however, may prove unfriendly 
under certain conditions. If there is 
any suspicion that fruit, which is to 
be eaten without cooking, has met 
with any uncleanly handling, it should 
be thoroughly washed before being 
sent to the table. It may be com- 
plained that berries lose something of 
their flavor by this process, but the 
injury is negligible compared with the 
possible results of neglecting such 
precaution. The danger of serving un- 
ripe or over-ripe fruit has been proved 
so many times that it is unnecessary 
to dwell on it; but even the best fresh 
fruit and vegetables should be avoided 
by anyone suffering from an over- 
active condition of the bowels. Cer- 
tain individuals, moreover, are unable 
to eat certain articles, notably straw- 
berries and tomatoes, without unpleas- 
ant effects, such as rheumatic attacks 
or a skin eruption; these persons 
should allow no exceptions to their 
rule of self-denial. 

The question of a pure milk supply 
is one of the most important factors in 
the summer welfare, in the case of 
children even more than of adults ; and 



here again the best is none too good 
for one's household. The water sup- 
ply in cities is usually safe, in these 
days, but wells in country places are 
not always above reproach, while 
drinking from wayside springs, whose 
origin is not known, is always a dan- 
gerous procedure. A fatal case of ty- 
phoid fever known to the writer is 
supposed to have been due to drinking 
from a contaminated spring while 
driving about a country district. 
Whether in town or out of it, if there 
is any uncertainty regarding the purity 
of the water used for drinking pur- 
poses, the wisest plan is to drink one 
of the many bottled spring waters, or 
else to boil all the water use'd. If milk 
is boiled, it becomes very constipat- 
ing; but if it is merely "pasteurized," 
or brought to just below the boiling 
point, and kept there for twenty min- 
utes, all injurious germs in it are de- 
stroyed. The necessity for great care 
in the cleansing of milk bottles, and 
the danger of giving young children 
milk that has been allowed to stand 
about unprotected, are too generally 
understood by the twentieth century 
mother to be dwelt upon here. 

While cold and especially iced foods 
are particularly agreeable in summer, 
there are certain dangers connected 
with their use which should not be for- 
gotten. On even the hottest day, it is 
risky to serve a meal at which the 
greater part of the dishes are ice-cold, 
for the eating of very cold food re- 
tards digestion, and, carried to excess, 
may cause a serious disturbance. This 
is even more true of the taking of iced 
food and iced drinks when over- 
heated; severe illness and even imme- 
diate death have been known to re- 
sult from carelessness in this particu- 
lar. A medical man once said in the 
hearing of the writer that ice-water 
was an insult to the stomach; and 
when a person has been exercising 
violently on a hot day, or is thoroughly 
over-heated by exposure to the sun or

a very high temperature, the shock 
produced by the hasty drinking of ice- 
cold fluids or the eating of ice-cream 
may be a deadly insult not only to the 
stomach but the whole organism, and 
the most disastrous results may fol- 
low. The drinking of plenty of cool 
water is of especial value in summer, 
when the body perspires most freely; 
but ice-water, particularly when taken 
rapidly and in large quantities, is good 
for no one, and those who can teach 
themselves to drink, instead, water of 
a temperature differing less violently 
from that of their bodies, are sure to 
be the better for it in the long run. 

Soft drinks of all descriptions, espe- 
cially soda water, have an enormous 
sale in hot weather, and what has been 
said of drinking cold water when over- 
heated is even more emphatically true 
in their case, as these popular and 
delicious combinations of carbonated 
water, fruit syrups and sugar may 
work woe to the digestive machinery, 
where water alone would not do so. 
Furthermore, young people are often 
given to treating one another, in turn, 
to soda water and other iced drinks, 
thus perhaps indulging in them several 
times in one afternoon or evening. 
Even if the strong digestive power of 
healthy youth preserves them from 
immediate disaster, such habits may 
lay the foundation for trouble later in 
life. 

Actual sunstroke is not of very fre- 
quent occurrence in temperate lati- 
tudes, except among those engaged in 
laborious occupations, which expose 
them to the direct heat of the sun or 
to very high artificial temperatures, 
and among heavy eaters and drinkeis, 
especially the latter. However, it is 
by no means unknown under other 
conditions, and heat prostration, which 
is quite a different affection, and needs 
exactly opposite treatment, is very 
common. Sunstroke, — or, more prop- 
erly, heatstroke, since direct exposure 
to the rays of the sun is not necessary 



to produce it, — is characterized by 
very high bodily temperature, absence 
of perspiration, and, usually, uncon- 
sciousness. In heat prostration, the 
body is cool, and the patient pale, 
weak, sick and faint ; an attack may be 
so slight as to produce merely a head- 
ache and a sense of exhaustion, or so 
severe as to cause the patient's death 
from failure of the heart. In heat- 
stroke the temperature must be low- 
ered by a cold bath, cold wet packs, 
or the application of ice to the body; 
heat prostration, on the other hand, 
should be treated by rest and stimula- 
tion, as in the case of faintness and 
exhaustion from other causes. A per- 
son who has once been affected is very 
liable to a repetition of the experience, 
and in order to keep in good condition 
during the heated term, he should, as 
far as possible, avoid exposure to the 
sun. Nor is it well for those who have 
never suffered from this cause to be 
too confident of their ability to with- 
stand the power of Old Sol's rays. 

Playing tennis or baseball, or even 
golfing or walking, especially bare- 
headed, under the blazing sun of a 
midsummer day, when the thermometer 
is high and the humidity considerable, 
is not a wise proceeding even for the 
strongest; and, though children will 
often continue their out-door play 
with little regard for the heat, they 
should be kept in the shade and pre- 
vented from engaging in too strenuous 
forms of amusement during the hot- 
test hours of the day. 

The substitution of gas and electric 
stoves and fireless cookers, as far as 
possible, for the coal range in the 
kitchen will do much to prevent dan- 
ger from working in an over-heated 
room to those who have in charge the 
preparation of meals for the house- 
hold, while the use of gas or electric 
irons will save not only time and 
trouble, but much of the discomfort of 
laundry work, which is, perhaps the most 
trying of all housework. 



Cold Dishes for Hot Days 



By Marian C. Kellar 

Freah Fruih ^es/ 



FREEDOM from the preparation 
of hot heavy dishes should be 
the housewife's declaration of in- 
dependence during the long summer 
months. When possible, it is a good plan 
to follow the custom of the women in 
the smaller towns, and serve the hot 
meal at noon, and a cold supper, gener- 
ally with a creamed vegetable and tea 
biscuits as the hot dish. Cold sliced 
meat, salad and fresh fruit complete this 
sensible menu. 

The dishes which custom has made us 
serve hot, but which can be served cold 
and made just as tasty, are legion. Na- 
ture intended us to eat fruits and vege- 
tables fresh as possible in the summer, 
as they are more cooling to the blood, 
and it is popular and sensible to substi- 
tute them, especially fruit, as a first 
course instead of hot soup, — fresh ber- 
ries, mixture of fruits, sweetened and 
kept on ice for an hour or two before 
serving, pineapple, orange, bananas and 
melons. With a big spoon "eggs" may 
be scooped from the pink pulp of the 
watermelon. The effect of the pink eggs 
on a bed of ice or grape leaves, as a first 
course, with pink flowers in the center 
of the table, is cooling in itself. 

An appetizing hors d'ccuvre for sum- 
mer consists of two not too thick slices 
of firm ripe tomato for each plate. To 
a French dressing, mad6 with half a tea- 
spoon of mustard and an extra drop of 
vinegar, add fine-chopped watercress 
until thick; cover each slice and put two 
together in a sandwich. On top lay an 
anchovy, curled as it comes from the 
bottle. 

A tasty and beautiful first course for 
dinner is formed of bananas. Select 
perfect fruit, pale yellow and without 
specks, and not too large. Prepare one 



for each guest. Cut the bananas length- 
wise, not separating the two pieces at 
the stem end, so that a case is formed. 
Remove the fruit and, with a scoop, make 
four round balls. Put these back in the 
skins and pour in as much sweet lemon 
gelatin as the skin will hold. Lay the 
lid back and place on ice. When opened 
the banana looks like a mammoth yellow 
pea pod. Eat with a spoon. This is, 
also, good for dessert. 

For variety there are baked fruits, 
peaches, baked just as you bake apples, 
taking out the peach stones and filling 
the cavity with chopped nuts, raisins, 
and sugar. Set the peaches in a pan with 
a little water and bake. Serve each in 
an individual glass with whipped cream. 
Bananas may be baked in their skins for 
twenty or thirty minutes, then arranged 
on a hot dish with melted currant jelly, 
poured over them. 

A popular hot weather dessert is to 
take half of a cantaloupe and fill it with 
ice cream or ice. Pulled pineapple is 
always acceptable for a first course or 
for dessert. 

Pare the pineapple, take out the eyes 
with a sharp knife, then pull the pulp 
apart, using two forks. Only ripe sweet 
pineapples should be used. The pine- 
apple shell, when left intact, makes a 
pretty receptacle for a fruit salad. 

Vegetable salad can be made from a 
small quantity of vegetables. A combi- 
nation salad for six persons can be made 
from two tiny heads of lettuce, two or 
three tomatoes, one cucumber, one green 
pepper, and a couple of radishes. When 
the ingredients are sliced thin or chopped 
fine, they go farther than one would 
imagine. The odds and ends of fruit 
left in berry boxes and baskets will 
combine into a delicious fruit salad.

COLD DISHES FOR HOT DAYS 



51 



Making Work Easier 

One vital secret of making one's work 
easier in hot weather is to buy food in 
small quantities. Let the grocer and 
butcher keep food f reish in their big ice 
boxes. Even if you have to make more 
trips to them, you will have dollars by 
not having to throw out spoiled meats, 
vegetables and fruits. ' 

Shun big roasts unless the family is 
large; small steaks, chops, cutlets, 
chicken croquettes, veal and beef loaves, 
sweetbreads, kidney, heart and tender- 
loins, — ^these oflFer a great variety in the 
way of preparation and are just as 
wholesome and much cheaper than big 
roasts; but the less meat we eat in hot 
weather the better for us. Many house- 
wives only serve meat once a week dur- 
ing July and August. Eggs are the most 
popular substitute. 

Foreigners have learned the art of 
serving vegetables, cold, with oil, vine- 
gar, chopped parsley and a hint of onion. 
Asparagus, tomato, cauliflower, string 
beans, beets and spinach, are the best 
liked for cold service. 

In Place of Meats 

One can dispense with meat even at 
a company luncheon, by making a spe- 
cialty of some attractive vegetable dish; 
and this may be served either as a first 
course or as a salad. Stuffed peppers, 
tomatoes, and potatoes are popular for 
luncheon and supper dishes. Here are 
some rules for the preparation of these 
dishes. 

New Corn Puddings — Grate the corn 
from one dozen ears, add two eggs, one- 
half pint of milk, one tablespoonful of 
butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
half a teaspoonful of salt. Bake in in- 
dividual molds, in a moderate oven, for 
three-quarters of an hour. Unmold 
when cool on a large platter, cover with 
a white sauce and place around the edge 
a border of tomato fritters, and then a 
wreath of parsley. The color combina- 
tion is good and the dish is delicious. 



Stuffed Green Peppers — Cut the stem 
end from green peppers of equal size and 
remove the seeds and white skin. Par- 
boil and stuff with cooked rice or maca- 
roni, minced chicken or veal, bread- 
crumbs, and chopped, hard-boiled eggs. 
Season with minced parsley, onion juice 
and salt. Moisten with stock. Bake in 
a pan with a little water until they are 
tender, but not overdone. 

Stuffed tomatoes may be prepared in 
the same way, with the same mixtures. 
Stuffed potatoes are a very good dinner 
dish, also potatoes au gratin; both take 
the place of meat. 

Well-Seasoned Cold Soups 

When you get in the habit of serving 
cold soups, you will never set a dish of 
hot soup before your family in dog days. 
The cold soups are really aspic, made of 
soup stock and vegetables, just as any 
soup is made and thickened with enough 
gelatin to give them the proper consist- 
ency. Cold soup is served in cups. 
Chicken comes first in popularity, then 
tomato, then beef stock. Of course, in 
preparing soup to be served, it must be 
well-seasoned, for you wish your family 
to like it instantly. 

Parsley, celery and bay leaves give 
chicken soup a good flavor, and a bit of 
red pepper adds piquancy. The water in 
which the vegetables were boiled, and the 
creamed vegetables, left over, may be 
converted into summer soups, cream 
soups, by the addition of milk and soup 
stock, thickened. 

When the vegetables are used, as spin- 
ach, celery, asparagus, peas, or beans, 
they are first cooked until tender, then 
rubbed through a fine sieve, and added 
to the milk and soup stock in the pro- 
portion of two cups of vegetable pulp 
to one quart of soup stock or milk, or 
half stock and half milk. 

Gelatin as an Ally 

Gelatin is the housewife's best ally in 
summer. By its aid she can evolve many 
delicious cold dishes, but it must always 



52 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



be flavored to render it digestible and 
nutritious. Aspic is gelatin made of 
meat stock. One can' make a great va- 
riety of vegetable aspics. Boil carrots, 
lima or string beans, beets and aspara- 
gus, and when cold cut them into fancy 
shapes or dice them. Arrange in layers 
and cover with the aspic, letting each 
layer' harden a little before arranging 
the next. When covered with the aspic 
set away to harden. Chicken, tongue, 
and other meat aspics are always well 
liked. If one has only a few slices of 
chicken, ham and tongue, these can be 
made into an attractive dish by garnish- 
ing the platter with little molds of aspic, 
hard-boiled eggs, slices of beet pickles, 
and a border of cress. Everything here 
is good and nutritious. 

Cold boiled fish are delicious when 
covered with jellied mayonnaise and dec- 
orated with capers, beets, lemon points 
and so on. Cold eggs may be served in 
a variety of ways during the summer. 
Little individual ramekins are nice for 
serving shirred, poached or cold eggs, 
custards and souffles. There is less 
waste of foods served in individual 
forms than from a large dish. 



Ideal Hot Weather Menus 

An ideal menu for a June luncheon 
consisted of cold consomme in cups, cauli- 
flower in ramekins, asparagus salad, each 
tip passed through a ring of pimentos, 
and served with French dressing. The 
dessert was a slice of sponge cake over 
which was poured a sauce made of 
strawberries, prepared as for shortcake, 
with creamed butter and sugar. The 
sauce is poured over the cake at table, 
so that it has no time to become soggy. 
Chicken croquettes were also served with 
lemon sauce. 

For a dainty Sunday evening tea the 
menu may be aspic, cream of pea soup, 
a fruit salad, toasted crackers and cream 
cheese, and ice cream served in individ- 
ual forms, with vanilla wafers. An 
emergency dessert, and a good one, is 
quickly made by slicing as many bananas 
as there are people to serve into a deep 
glass dish. Sprinkle with powdered 
sugar and pour over one-half as many 
tablespoons of lemon juice as there are 
bananas used. Heap upon the sliced 
fruit whipped cream, and sprinkle with 
crystallized ginger, cut in fine straws. 



Simple Living 



Ifs perfectly splendid how healthy we feel 

Since restricting ourselves to "one thing at a meal" 



Now, dear, come to supper; strong bouillon 

and toast 
And think of our neighbors ^11 heavily dosed 
With soup, fish, meat, salad, dessert, coflFee, 

cheese, 

While we are contented with just one of 
these. 

Do sprinkle some Worcestershire into your 
cup: 

I think that the bouillon needs livening up; 

And then spread your toast with this fresh 

mayonnaise 

It's fine! Fve had nothing so tasty for days; 
And wouldn't this mayonnaise go well with 

pears? 
All right! there they are by the chocolate 

eclairs. 



And while you are up, darling, reach down 
those dates 

And the walnuts and figs and those two din- 
ner plates — 

Fresh cookies? They're up on the shelf in 
that jar 

Where the fruit cake and crullers and ginger- 
snaps are. 

Your mother sent over some nesselrode too; 

It's awfully rich but I like it— don't you? 

Well scoup out your half and then pass it to 
me 

While I brew a pot of that lovely strong 
tea 

All finished! and oh, how aesthetic wc feel 
Just because of our rule of one thing at a 
meal.

Making The Home G)mfortable for Summer 



By Anne Guilbert Mahon 



I SPEND my summers at home," 
said a busy woman. **My husband 
gets no vacation during the sum- 
mer, and I do not feel Hke leaving him 
alone. Apart from a few week-end trips 
together, and a day's outing once in 
awhile, I am at home all summer — in the 
city. 

"I manage to keep very comfortable 
and happy, too. Sometimes I think I 
am happier than some of my friends 
who go away f on the whole summer and 
who do not always find the place chosen 
for their vacations satisfactory. 

"I prepare for the summer, however, 
just as if I were going away, and I try 
to get all the benefit I can from change. 
In the first place, I make my home as 
different as I can from what it is in 
winter. That provides some sort of a 
change, you know, even to make the 
rooms look different, to change the 
furniture around. I fix my house up es- 
pecially for summer. I try to make it 
look as cool and as restful and as com- 
fortable as I can during the hot days, 
and also to have it in a condition which 
entails as little labor as possible for me 
to keep it clean and in order. 

"All the heavy draperies I take down 
in the spring, and I get cool-looking 
scrim to take their places. A pale tan 
scrim with light green stripe is very cool 
and refreshing to the sight. These cur- 
tains are easily laundered and kept 
fresh, too. 

"All small pictures and useless orna- 
ments I put away. No bric-a-brac is left 
out except what we absolutely need — a 
vase or two for fresh flowers and other 
things which we use. Dusting a lot of 
small things each day is very wearying 
when the hot days come, so I eliminate 
as much of it as possible; besides, the 
rooms when not cluttered up with a lot 
of small things seem ever so much more 



spacious and cool-looking. Large pic- 
tures I cover with very fine netting to 
keep them from being fly-specked or 
dust-marked. 

"The furniture is covered with cool 
green and white, striped linen, and I 
have the rugs sent to the cleaners and 
cool green matting ones substituted for 
them during the summer. You would 
not believe the difference it makes in 
the appearance of the rooms, nor how 
much cooler and more inviting they look 
on hot days. 

"At the first approach of warm 
weather we have our awnings put up, 
so we can keep the rooms shaded and 
comparatively cool during even the hot- 
test part of the day. Indeed, when I 
look around my cool, comfortable, taste- 
ful rooms, on a blazing hot day in Au- 
gust, and think of the stuffy, cooped-up 
little bedroom I might be occupying in 
even one of the best summer hotels, and 
when I contrast my utter freedom and 
independence with the restricted Ufe in 
a boarding house, no matter how de- 
sirable it may be, I think sometimes that 
I am a fortunate being to be so comfort- 
able, even if I am obliged to stay at 
home, in the city. 

"I am my own cook, and I prepare 
for summer comfort in the kitchen just 
as I do in the rest of the house. With 
my gas range and fireless cooker I am 
able to keep my kitchen as cool as any 
of the other rooms. We believe in 
eliminating much meat and all heavy, 
rich, made dishes and pastry from our 
bills of fare on the hot summer days. 
Being in town, we have the best choice 
of all the fresh fruits and vegetables, 
which to our minds make the most sat- 
isfactory meals during the hot days. I 
always keep on hand a stock of good 
canned supplies — for use in case of 
emergencies, if the day should be too

hot to go out to market, or if company 
drops in unexpectedly. I try to make 
my work as easy and light as I can by 
avoiding all unnecessary duties. I real- 
ize that everyone needs a vacation, es- 
pecially in summer, and I try to take 
one, even if I have to stay at home — in 
the city. I always have on hand several 
of the latest books, the current maga- 
zines, a bit of attractive fancywork to 
pick up on warm afternoons when I feel 
so inclined, just asi if I were going to be 
away. It makes me feel that I am rest- 
ing and enjoying myself. 

"I enjoy the freedom of my home. I 
can dress as I please. I can do as I 
please. One cannot always say the 
same when boarding at some resort. I 
have the privileges of my bath and 
shower whenever I wish it. I can seek 
the coolest spot in the house and stay 
there as long as I want. I am not con- 
fined to one room. On rainy days — and 



often we have many of them in the 
summer — I always thank my lucky stars 
that I am at home, where I can be com- 
fortable, and occupy myself as I please, 
instead of being forced to spend dreary 
days in a hotel parlor, crowded with 
other guests and full of badly behaved 
children, or in the restricted quarters of 
a boarding house bedroom. 

* 'There are many compensations for 
spending one's vacation at home. A 
woman can get lots of pleasure and real 
benefit, if she sets about it in the right 
way, prepares her house, eliminates un- 
necessary work, takes as many outings 
as she can and makes the most of them. 
One can have the vacation spirit, the 
rest, the recreation, even the change, if 
one lias to stay at home. Experience 
has taught me how to do it. Any wom- 
an can learn and can be happy and com- 
fortable during a summer vacation at 
home, if she tries." 



How Honest Are We? 

By Alice Margaret Ashton 



WOMAN'S bump of honesty is 
said to be not so well devel- 
oped as that of man. It is 
claimed that a woman does not repose 
the trust in her fellow woman that one 
man ordinarily accords another, and, 
therefore, that an ingrained vein of dis- 
honesty must be a womanly trait. 

Whether or not this is true must re- 
main a disputed question. But, since 
the question is raised, it behooves us, 
ai women, to look carefully to our indi- 
vidual honesty. Little as we like the 
accusation, there is always the possibility 
of there being in it a grain of truth. 
"But dear me," cried a nervous little 
woman in much distress when the sub- 
ject was brought up in her presence, 
"does that mean that we are all liable 
to start right in some day and take some- 



one's silver spoons or her card basket?" 
Appropriating other people's posses- 
sions is accorded a dishonesty. Of a 
multitude of possessions, surely our sil- 
ver spoons and card baskets are not the 
most valuable! 

Time, to some women, is a very pre- 
cious possession. Even the housekeeper 
who considers herself extremely busy 
can hardly appreciate the value of an 
hour to some sister who is often com- 
bining the duties of wage-earner and 
home-maker. The appropriating of 
other people's time is a dishonesty more 
common among women than it should 
be. When we say, "I am coming to see 
you some afternoon this week," or 
"You may look for me Friday evening, 
if nothing else comes up," we are mak- 
ing an unnecessary claim upon their 



HOW HONEST ARE WE? 



55 



time. Doubtless all of us have experi- 
enced the aggravation of remaining at 
home for an expected visit which never 
materialized, yet we thoughtlessly in- 
flict the same injustice upon our friends. 
If the visit is of importance, make a 
definite engagement and keep it or send 
an apology sufficiently early to free the 
second person from all obligation. If 
it is of no importance, chance it to luck 
to find your friend at home. It is the 
only honest way. 

The woman who is always late is 
cheating her friends of many pleasures. 
If they are to accompany her to a play 
or a concert, she cheats them out of the 
first number. If it is a picnic or an ex- 
cursion, she keeps a whole party wait- 
ing — ^people who have left duties undone 
which they would have liked to take time 
to accomplish — while she takes as much 
of their time as she chooses. She ap- 
propriates her hostess* peace of mind, 
and often her reputation for serving a 
good dinner. Yet this deliberate woman 
would be indignant at the very sugges- 
tion that this might be called dishonest. 

Is it quite honest to take too personal 
an interest in our friends' affairs unless 
the information is voluntarily given? 
Isn't it cheating them of a very precious 
privacy, which ought to be the right of 
everyone ? 

Our judgments are often a great and 
uncalled-for injustice. We are distinct- 
ly enjoined to "judge not," and yet in 
the face of this positive prohibition, we 
dare offer our puny judgments on the 
conduct of our friends, not knowing the 
circumstances or what is in their hearts. 

The "best foot" is a much maligiied 
member. In its name are committed 
many needless deceptions and even un- 
kindnesses. Brave indeed is the woman 
who makes the best of every circum- 
stance, resolutely going forward with 
the "best foot" to meet the world cheer- 
fully, carrying a message of strength and 
inspiration. But how about the striv- 
ings, the petty jealousies, th^ "white 



fibs?" "We were at Mrs. A's for sup- 
per Thursday evening," said a woman 
to a special friend of Mrs. A's. And it 
was some weeks before Mrs. B learned, 
by chance, that the supper was a public 
one, given for charity. No matter how 
strong the temptation, this is a weakness 
of which we should strive never to be 
guilty. So often a little word, not in 
itself strictly untruthful, can place us in 
such false positions with our friends; 
and nothing else will so soon destroy 
our confidence in an associate as to ob- 
serve her employment of these half- 
deceptions. 

Does it seem possible that any nice 
woman would wish things for which she 
does not pay? "Mrs. Brown is much 
offended because I did not invite her to 
my last party," said a recent hostess, 
wearily. "But Mrs. Brown has never 
entertained you," answered her husband, 
"and you have had her here several 
times." "I know. But that doesn't 
seem to make any difference!" 

Social intercourse is extremely pleas- 
ant, and no one enjoys being "left out," 
but it carries with it obligations for 
which we ought to be willing to pay, if 
we are to enjoy the advantages. If 
household duties or professional work, 
crowd out our "social flings," we should 
not condemn our neighbors as un- 
friendly, because they do not continue 
to call and to invite us to their teas and 
dinners. We should expect attention 
only in those lines upon which we ex- 
pend our attention. 

What is the reason for these Httle dis- 
honesties of which, to be just, we can- 
not often accuse our husbands? Is it 
not more often due to thoughtlessness 
than to any other cause? Just a little 
kindly consideration for those with 
whom we come in contact is the very 
best remedy, just an occasional putting 
of ourselves in the other person's place. 
Since so simple a remedy may be pro- 
ductive of such beautiful results, let us 
-think !

Drinking Water in the Summer 
Camp 

IN a good many summer camps, it is 
absolutely necessary to boil all wa- 
ter which is to be used for drinking. 
That much is easy. But often times 
the larger problem is to keep enough 
cooled, ready for use. Especially is 
this so, when the ice box space is lim- 
ited. 

We have handled the question in 
this way. From the druggist we ob- 
tained three glass bottles which held 
about two gallons each. You know 
the kind with large mouths and glass 
stoppers. Do not get square bottles, 
as they would be much harder to keep 
clean and sweet. A large clean cloth 
is soaked in cold water and wound 
several times about the bottle. T^en 
the water, which was left standing in 
the kettle in which it was boiled until 
partially cooled, is poured into the bot- 
tle and this set into a basin containing 
about six inches of cold water. If 
these are placed in a shady spot, the 
water will soon become very cold. 

The cloths and bottles must be 
washed out every day or so, but the 
whole seems very little work, once the 
process has become part of the morn- 
ing's regular duties. 

We have often carried water in a 
Mason fruit jar, wound in a wet cloth, 
when going out for picnics. If the 
cloth is kept damp, the water will al- 
ways be cool. L. s. K.

The Value of Fruit Juice 



AN enterprising country woman, 
who makes jellies to sell, accom- 
plishes a great amount of work in an 
easy way by bottling the juice of each 
fruit in its season, and then postpon- 
ing the jelly making until the winter 



It is usually the case that the farm- 
er's wife is very busy just at the time 
when strawberries, raspberries and 
blackberries are ripening. The jelly- 
making would be an additional task. 

Mrs. A's method of extracting fruit 
juices is to heat the fruit in a double- 
boiler or to stew the fruit with a lit- 
tle water added; in either case strain 
the juice through cheesecloth (in the 
usual manner for making jelly). Then 
the juice is reheated and sealed in 
glass jars and bottles. 

In the fall, when apples are plentiful, 
she extracts the juice from apples in 
the same manner and adds berry juice, 
in the proportion of half and half of 
each, then the proper amount of sugar 
and cooks all together to make jelly. 

Several fruits, such as currants, 
gooseberries, quinces and cherries, are 
so tart that a much better tasting jelly 
is secured when they are combined 
with apples. 

New and delicious flavors are found 
by combining different fruits. Crab- 
apples with pears, strawberries with 
peaches, rhubarb with oranges and 
apples, are recommended. 

If desired, the extracted juices of 
strawberries, raspberries or blackber- 
ries can be used alone (without apple 
juice) to make excellent jelly. By can- 



HOME IDEAS AND ECONOMIES

ning the juice in the early summer as 
suggested, the jelly can be made in 
small quantities during the winter, and 
the fresh jelly is specially delightful. 

Bottled fruit juices can be utilized in 
different ways. Apple and pear but- 
ters and mince meat are improved by 
the addition of berry juices. 

In making fruit cake or plum pud- 
ding, half a cup of rich, thick juice 
from cherries, apples or grapes will 
give a delicious flavor. 

Fruit juice may be used in any viand 
where a recipe calls for brandy or 
wine, and the cake or pudding will 
keep well and be much nicer than if 
alcoholic preparations are used. 

Many persons object to preserves 
made from strawberries, raspberries 
and blackberries, on account of the 
numberless tiny seeds. They will 
gladly welcome the extracted juice of 
such fruits, served in small cups or 
deep saucers, as an appetizer for 
breakfast, or a dessert course at din- 
ner. 

Delicious cooling drinks can be 
made in the summer time from any 
fruit juice and water, or lemons may 
be used in a tempting combination. 

Fruit ices are healthful, economical 
and very popular. Any family can 
serve them frequently with very little 
trouble, if bottled fruit juices are on 
the pantry shelves. 

Blackberry juice is excellent for 
stomach troubles. 

Grape juice is the best tonic possi- 
ble for elderly people and delicate chil- 
dren. At the celebrated "Grape Cures" 
of Europe each invalid drinks several 
glasses of grape juice every day and 
eats very little solid food. n. f. m.

Housekeeping, — ^Wise and 
Otherwise 

THAT there is economy in system 
is proven beyond a doubt. In 
glancing over the average man's office, 
one is impressed with the order and 



completeness of the working outfit. 
System here is everything; it speaks 
from the stack of envelopes, from the 
blotting pad, the stamp box, the set of 
rules attached to each desk, the clip 
holding letters to be answered, each 
marked with a blue pencil for the de- 
partment for which it is intended. 
There is no mental digression and con- 
sequent loss of time, from having to 
stop in the thick of work to look up a 
stray document, for within easy reach 
is a card index and a cabinet file. The 
worker's thoughts hold steadily to the 
subject in mind until finished. There 
is no laying of work aside for a chat 
with a fellow clerk, a game of cards, 
or an afternoon matinee. If such were 
to happen, woe betide the business, it 
would soon hasten to the bow-wows. 

As in the office, so it is in every line 
of work in which men are engaged. 
The first requisite for perfect accom- 
plishment is a complete set of tools; 
the second is to have them within easy 
reach. Once a task is begun, it is fin- 
ished before another one is taken up. 
One at a time is the rule. 

Not so with the average woman, sys- 
tem has little place in her vocabulary. 
"Sufficient unto the day is the evil 
thereof" seems her favored slogan. 
Instead of being systemized her en- 
ergy usually runs riot with resultant 
disorder. Of her working tools, one 
may be found here, another there, a 
long search ensues for a third, and 
often a poor substitute is used, instead. 
No wonder that there are so many 
housekeeping failures, so many ineffi- 
cient houseworkers, so many dishes 
with savory promise in the compound- 
ing thereof, only to appear later upon 
the table unpalatable messes; and not 
only that, but representing a loss of 
time and money as well. So many 
tasks begun, then laid aside or discon- 
tinued altogether, and others taken up 
instead! The average woman's distrac- 
tions are many and various. 

*'It seems that I can never accom-' 



58 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



plish anything," complained a young 
home-maker. I am upstairs and down, 
picking up and turning over things, I 
never can find what I am looking for; 
and there's the beds to make, dishes to 
wash, and windows to clean, I never 
know what to do first. '^ 

She lacked a sy.Uem, every woman 
beginning life in her own home should 
take to her heart an old motto : "Have 
a place for everything and keep every- 
thing in its place;" and it is well to 
add, have a certain time for every 
household task, be it washing, ironing, 
sweeping, or baking. 

One need not be a system-fiend to 
effect a smooth continuity of the 
household work, for one is likely 
many times to be interrupted to bind 
up a little finger, to wipe away the 
tears, and comfort a child as only a 
mother can; but one may plan to dis- 
patch the work to the best advantage. 

Have certain hours for each daily 
task and adhere to them. Take each 
one in succession and see that it is 
thoroughly finished before commenc- 
ing the next one. If the attic is to be 
cleaned on a certain day, clean the at- 
tic on that day, and let kitchen and 
cellar go until you are through; clean 
from the top of the house downward, 
not from the bottom up. 

Have a shelf or closet, respectively, 
for the table linen, bed linen, and wool- 
ens; keep china, silver and glass, each 
in its alloted place. A basket is con- 
venient for garments that need mend- 
ing. Hat boxes, shoe and laundry 
bags, all lend their quota in keeping 
system in the ordering of the home. 

Have the kitchen well arranged, 
with every article in a familiar and 
convenient place, so that when a roast 
is to be prepared for the oven, a salad 
or cake to be made, no time is lost in 
collecting all the implements needed; 
and take each step of preparation in 
the order directed, so as to insure a 
successful termination of the under- 
taking. 



Keep a family account book and a 
house record. Don't have addresses 
here and receipts stuffed there, prob- 
ably in an old teapot. Business men 
use up-to-date filing systems in their 
offices; use them in the home and be 
quick, reliable, and accurate. A bill- 
hook handy for receipts, large envel- 
opes, for clippings, each labeled as to 
contents, and a vertical letter file, kre 
all worry saving devices, and go to- 
ward making housekeeping a work of 
pleasure, if not "one glad sweet song." 

Keep a strict account of all ex- 
penses, each under its proper heading ; 
there is a satisfaction in seeing at a 
moment's glance "just where the 
money goes." 

Remember that "Order is Heaven's 
first law," and all these helps make a 
great whole in the conservation of 
time and force, which is made a great 
subject in these days wherever wise 
men and women meet to discuss the 
betterment of their sisters, and im- 
provements in the methods of house- 
keeping. M. c. K.

Toasted Cocoanut Cakes at a 
Fashionable Tea-Room 

SOME pretty cakes, seen recently, 
were rounds cut from a sheet of 
cake as thick as English muffins but 
smaller in size around. These were 
frosted with white frosting and cov- 
ered well with shredded cocoanut. 
The top was toasted a light brown 
and garnished with a tiny mound of 
grated pistachio nuts, — which, for the 
cookery novice or for those far from 
city markets, it may be explained, are 
of a pretty light green color. 

Rarebit without Eggs 

When eggs are scarce make a nice 
rarebit, without them. Heat the fine- 
cut cheese in milk in a double-boiler, 
and thicken with a little cornstarch; 
in reality this is a white sauce; season 
well with red and white pepper, ta- 



HOME IDEAS AND ECONOMIES 



59 



basco, mustard, a little Worcestershire 
sauce or whatever is most liked in that 
line. Try this and be convinced. 

Fniit-and-Nut Butter 

Apple butter at ten cents a pound, 
and peanut butter at prices half as 
much again, serve very well instead of 
dairy butter at forty cents per pound, 
and if cows become much more scarce 
and labor also, we may come in time 
to making butter from the cocoanut, 
as do the people of the Pacific islands. 
Not "cocoa butter" so-called, for this 
is a by-product of the chocolate tree; 
but the cocoanut we all know so well, 
purchasable anywhere. Grate the meat 
of it and cover with water. Skim off 
the white fat that rises, and use as 
butter. It may be churned, by shak- 
ing it in a glass preserve jar, or in 
larger quantities, in churn. By many 
it is preferred, as purely free from dis- 
ease; it has been used in some sanita- 
riums of the United States by people 
familiar with it in the tropics. 

Vegetable Suggestions for the 

Garden 

The fine foreign parsley that is quite 
unlike our parsley, not curled but 
growing tall and slender, ♦ may be 
bought in Italian markets here. It is 
also called French parsley. Sweet 
basil is easily grown anywhere. 

Chervil may be planted, at intervals, 
all summer for seasoning salads and 
all such things as require savory 
herbs; it is far too little known; the 
seed is not expensive. Chard, too, is 
a boon in these days of back-yard gar- 
dening; it replaces spinach; its mid- 
ribs are like asparagus. When cold it 
makes a nice salad. 

Delicious Spinach 

Prepare, and boil as usual. Chop 
very fine, after draining. To season 
it, brown some flour in chicken fat, a 
medium-sized spoonful to a half-peck 
of spinach. When browned, add some 



chicken stock, salt, very little pepper, 
or none, if not admitted to the dietary, 
ginger, and a suspicion only of nut- 
meg, about twice across the grater, no 
more, and a little onion juice. Heat 
the spinach thoroughly in this sauce 
and blend it well. 

This comes from a fine suburban 
housekeeper of one of the middle 
states, whose guests always ask for 
her method of cooking spinach. 

A Philadelphia housekeeper always 
uses a rich cream sauce with a suspi- 
sion of nutmeg, and the spinach 
chopped as fine as possible. Some peo- 
ple even sift the tenderest young spin- 
ach and drain it perfectly dry, so it can 
be pressed in a mound for garnishing. 

We all know the expression, "Com- 
pany arriving at the eleventh hour," 
when the housekeeper mingles her 
greetings with thoughts of the larder. 
And bake-shops are not near every 
home. The following recipe for a cake 
that may be quickly made is g^ven by 
a capable housekeeper of Pennsyl- 
vania. 

Eleventh Hour Cake 

One and one-quarter cups of flour 
sifted with one teaspoonful of bakitig 
powder and one-quarter a teaspoonful 
of salt. One cup of sugar mixed with 
this well. 

In a half-pint cup put some very soft 
shortening, the size of an egg. Break 
into this two eggs and fill the cup with 
milk. Flavor to taste. "Dump" this 
into the flour and sugar mixture and 
"beat like mad." Bake in a buttered 
pan. 

Another hint from the same source 
is to add some stick cinnamon, the 
very best, thin and fragrant, to quince 
preserves while cooking. 

Lemon, rind and all, cut very fine or 
grated, is also nice with quinces and 
apricots when made into preserve or 
sauce, etc.

Something New in Olives 

We have not any new kind of olives, 
but a new way of preparing them for 
use, that is, slicing them before they 
are bottled. Instead of paying for a 
lot of stones and serving the olives 
whole, now one may buy them all cut 
in rings, very pretty for garnishing 
dishes, very handy to help oneself to 
instead of a cold, slippery oval object 
sure to roll away unless very securely 
prodded with an olive fork; and it is 
very much more easily and gracefully 
eaten, since a ring may be severed, 
whereas a whole olive had to be lifted 
to the lips and nibbled, and then the 
stone discarded as deftly as possible. 
It is a wonder we have not had stoned 
olives before, since comparatively few 
have a chef at hand to stone them 
neatly, nor a cooking school teacher to 
impart the information. To be sure, 
stuffed olives, the heart of pimentoes 
or celery, have been fads of fashion, 
but not everyone likes these combina- 
tions. 

The dark, purple-red, ripe olives are 
softer in texture and much esteemed 
for the table as more easy of digestion 
than the green; in fact, they are given 
freely to children, who do not always 
chew their food properly, and to older 
folk who have not the best of grind- 
ers with which to divide the firm green 
olives into minute particles. 

A blessing, indeed, in these rushing 
days is the sliced olive, a very handy 
adjunct to the salad garnishing, and 
eleventh hour entertaining, whether a 
mid-day luncheon or a mid-night sup- 
per. 

English Muffins and Crumpets As 
They Should Be 

Although the cooking teachers give 
out nice recipes for making these nice, 
hot breads, the so-called English muf- 
fins on sale in our large cities are usu- 
ally big, tough, grey-looking things. 

"The Muffin Man of Dniry Lane" 



must have gone out of business long 
ago; surely the children who hear 
about him, and the parents who have 
long read about him, would welcome 
him almost next to Santa Claus, were 
he to appear with some of his really- 
truly English muffins, all hot and 
toasted I 

The English muffin is cooked upon 
a griddle ; it is turned and cooked alike 
on both sides; it is not the American 
baked muffin, high and light with bak- 
ing powder. 

If made of bread dough, it is a muf- 
fin ; if made with an tgg and sweeten- 
ing and shortening, it is a crumpet, to 
be very exact; just as a doughnut is 
raised dough fried in fat, and a cruller 
a sweet, rich dough fried in the same 
way. 

Muffins may be dropped upon a grid- 
dle, or confined there in rings made 
for the purpose. Sometimes, in the 
hurry of the American family for 
breakfast, and the slowness of the 
process of cooking a supply on a grid- 
dle, part of the raised batter is put in 
the usual muffin pans and baked in the 
oven. It is very nice thus, and sure 
to be done well in the centre. The 
English fashion is, first, to cook the 
muffin on both sides and then tear it 
open with forks and toast the center 
well, before serving with tea. 

Cheese muffins are made by using 
this raised batter and putting one or 
more pieces of cheese in the center of 
each muffin before cooking. It is bet- 
ter to add the cheese in this way in- 
stead of stirring it in, since it will 
scorch, if it come next the sides or 
bottom of the tin when baking. These 
raised cheese muffins are very nice for 
a supper, on a cold chilly night, with 
coiTee, or tea and apple sauce. 

Dates "go" with old-fashioned gra- 
ham muffins especially well, but they 
are nice with flour muffins. 

Blueberry muffins and such hot cakes 
are littlie known outside of New Eng- 
land. J. D. c

flour, the quantity must be cut down 
one-eighth of a cup. You say you "stir-

that was a waste of time, and, of course, 
a waste of materials. Let the sugar and

ence the number of yolks should exceed 
that of the whites, as an omelet more 
tender and of looser texture results. 
Thudicum asserts that all cookery books, 
up to 1840, omit a number, up to half, 
of all the whites and Kitchiner says that 
no art can prevent an omelet being hard, 
if too much of the white be left in it. 

The Pan 

The pan should be thin, as quick cook- 
ing is of importance; it should not be 
large, as one of the first requisites in a 
perfect omelet is thickness. The great- 
est care and skill are needed to secure 
an omelet in which the eggs are not 
liquid, but barely set. 

Utensil for Serving 

A spoon or fork is the proper utensil 
for serving. If a knife needs be used, 
the omelet is a failure. 

French Omelet 

To make a French omelet, break the 
eggs into a bowl; add as many table- 
spoonfuls of water as there are eggs, 
counting two yolks as a whole egg, and 
for each three eggs, a dash of pepper 
and one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt; 
beat the eggs with a spoon, or fork, until 
a spoonful can be taken up; then strain 
into another bowl. If a mild flavor of 
garlic be agreeable, rub the inside of the 
bowl into which the eggs are to be 
broken with a clove of garlic. Have 
ready, in the cleanest, smoothest, and 
thinnest of frying-pans, a tablespoonful 
of melted butter; into this pour the egg 
mixture, set on a hot part of the range 
for a moment, then, with a thin knife, or 
spatula, separate the cooked portion 
from the side of the frying-pan, and 
gently rock the pan back and forth, the 
side next the handle raised as the pan 
is pushed forward and the opposite side 
raised as it is brought back, that the un- 
cooked part may run down next the pan. 
When creamy throughout, begin at the 
side of the pan next the handle and roll 
the omelet, letting the pan rest on the 



stove a moment, until the omelet is 
browned slightly, adding a little butter, 
if needed, and turn on to a hot platter. 

Formula for a Three-Egg Omelet 



2 whole eggs 

2 yolks of eggs 

3 tablespoonfuls of

i teaspoonful of salt

1 tablespoonful of

PuflFy Omelet 

To make a puffy omelet, beat the 
whites of the eggs until dry; beat the 
yolks until light-colored and thick; add 
to the yolks a tablespoonful of water 
for each yolk, and one-fourth a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a dash of pepper 
for each three yolks ; mix together thor- 
oughly, and turn over the beaten whites, 
then cut and pore the whites into the 
yolk mixture. Have the pan buttered 
hot as before, turn in the mixture, 
spreading it evenly over the pan. Let 
stand for about two minutes, where 
there is a moderate heat, then set in the 
oven to cook the top slightly. Just as 
soon as a knife — ^thrust into the centre 
of the omelet — comes out nearly clean, 
remove from the oven, cut across the 
centre of the top, at right angles to the 
handle, fold the part nearest the handle 
over the other part, and turn on to a 
hot platter. 

Either the plain French omelet, or 
the puffy omelet may be varied by the 
use of a filling, or a garnish, or both. 
The filling, if fine chopped, as parsley, 
or other herbs, may be mixed with the 
body of the omelet; though by '^filling' 
we usually mean a little of the desired 
article chopped fine or cut in small 
cubes, perhaps mixed with a sauce, 
sprinkled on to the surface of thfe omelet 
before it is folded. When used as a 
garnish the article is mixed with & sauce 
and poured about the omelet. Gre^n,, or 
canned peas in white sauce, mushrooms, 
fresh or canned, macaroni in tomato- 
sauce, oysters in cream-sauce, fine- 
chopped ham, of chicken, asparagus- 
tips, and tomatoes are among the favor- 
ite fillings and garnishes. ,

Omelets with a Starchy 
Foundation 

Oftentimes an omelet is desired that 
will keep in good condition a short in- 
terval after it has been made. In this 
case, a thickening ingredient is added 
to help hold up the eggs. In order to be 
either wholesome, or palatable, this 
foundation must be thoroughly cooked 
before the eggs are added. While dish- 
es of this class are called omelets, they 
belong more properly to the group of 
pancakes. 

Mrs. Grant's Omelet 



1 cup of sweet milk 

2 tablespoon fuls of 
butter 

2 tablespoonfuls of 
flour - » 



i a teaspoonful of 

salt ' 
Dash of pepper 
5 eggs 

2 tablespoonfuls of 
butter 



With the first five ingredients make a 
white sauce ; stir this gradually into the 
beaten yolks of the eggs, then fold in the 
whites <3f the eggs, beaten dry. Melt the 
last two tablespoonfuls of butter in the 
omelet pan, pour in the mixture and 
cook as a puffy omelet. Fine-chopped 
ham, chicken, oysters parboiled and cut 
in pieces, mushrooms cut in pieces, etc., 
etc., may be added to the sauce with the 
yolks of eggs. 

Rice Omelet 



2 tablespoonfuls of 

butter 
2 eggs 



i a teaspoonful of 

salt 
1 cup of warm, 

boiled rice 



Beat the eggs, and add the salt and 
rice ; the grains of rice should be whole 
and each held separately in the egg mix- 
ture; if the rice be very dry, add two 
tablespoonfuls of milk. Cook as a puffy 
omelet. 

Other Uses for Omelet Pan 

To make an omelet, especially a 
French omelet, successfully, the surface 
of the pan must be kept in an exceed- 
ingly smooth condition, and it is best 
to use the pan for no other purpose. 
Rub over with salt before using. 



Query 2Q26.— "Recipe for Bar-lc-Duc." 

Bar-le-Duc 

Take selected gooseberries or currants 
of large size, one by one, and with tiny 
eftibroidery scissors carefully cut the 
skin on one side, making a slit of per- 
haps one-fourth an inch. Through this, 
with a sharp needle, remove the seeds, 
one at a time, to preserve the shape of 
the fruit. Take the weight of the fruit 
in strained honey, and, when hot, add 
the prepared fruit. Let simmer three or 
four minutes. Carefully skim out the 
fruit. Reduce the syrup, at a gentle 
simmer, to the desired consistency. 
Pour over the fruit. Then store as jelly.

Human Foods. By Makry Shyder. 
Cloth. Price, $1.25 net. New York: 
The MacMillan Co. 

The book aims to present some of the 
principles of human nutrition along with 
a study of the more common articles of 
food. It is believed that a better under- 
standing of the subject of nutrition will 
suggest ways in which foods may be se- 
lected and utilized more intelligently, re- 
sulting not only in pecuniary saving, but 
also in greater efficiency of physical and 
mental effort. 

Prominence is given in this work to 
those foods, as flour, bread, cereals, veg- 
etables, meats, milk, dairy products, and 
fruits, that are most extensively used in 
the dietary, and to some of the physical, 
chemical, and bacteriological changes 
affecting digestibility and nutritive value 
which take place during their prepara- 



tion for the table. Dietary studies, com- 
parative cost and value of foods, ra- 
tional feeding of men, and experiments 
and laboratory practice form features of 
the work. Some closely related topics, 
largely of a sanitary nature, as the effect 
upon food of household sanitation and 
storage, are also briefly discussed. Ref- 
erences are given in case more extended 
information is desired on some of the 
subjects treated. While this book was 
prepared mainly for students who have 
taken a course in general chemistry, it 
has been the intention to present the top- 
ics in such a way as to be understood by 
the layman also. 

To those who wish to make somewhat 
of a scientific study of foods the l>ook 
furnishes an excellent guide and hand- 
book. It is especially adapted for use in 
schools and institutions where industrial 
subjects are taught. It is a text-book, 
and yet the general reader can acquire

ory and practice. While there is a cen- 
tral theme, the book rambles over a vast, 
amount of ground, from a discussion of 
the adulterated food frauds which are 
now being fairly well known about in 
America to a scathing protest against 
ungastronomic America and prophecies 
in regard to a better future for the 
nation. 

Mr. Finck calls to mind the old Puri- 
tan theory that it was a wicked indulg- 
ence to enjoy one's food, and the story 
of Walter Scott's father and his filling 
the boy's soup with hot water because 
the boy had expressed enjoyment of the 
meal. He lays stress on the fact that 
enjoyment in food aids to its digestion, 
and that food in which there is no pleas- 
ure lies like a heavy load upon the stom- 
ach. A cultivation of the sense of smell 
is seriously recommended, because so 
much of our pleasure in eating is the re- 
sult of our sense of smell. He goes into 
an ecstacy of description in regard to 
French soups and sauces, and one won- 
ders that there can be so much delight 
in the world as he finds in the mere re- 
membrance of the foreign dishes he has 
eaten. 

He has studied not only French foods 
in result, but has explored the subject 
of raising and preparing the foods. In 
the question of the United States, he 
prophesies that the high cost of beef and 
mutton will never go down again, but 
that America must take to the raising of 
poultry to form the staple of diet. "Food 
and Flavor" is not written merely for 
housewives, but can be enjoyed by men 
and women throughout the length and 
breadth of the land." 

After reading this book one ought to 
know more about what constitutes real 
health and enjoyment in life.

It is not a matter of longevity. It's

I was postponing the consideration of 
problems. Now I have decision. I 
tackle things when they come up and 
settle them. I have at least three hours 
more a day in which to accomplish some- 
thing worth while. I am not saving 
money by the swear-off — that's a fallacy. 
What I spent on tobacco goes for' some- 
thing else. My wife has more expensive 
hats and my neckties are of better 
quality."

Here we have a man's view of the 
so-called woman's movement, entitled 
"Studies in Modern Feminism." Opin- 
ions are of little worth; there are too 
many of them. Facts are facts and con- 
ditions are conditions — matters to be 
faced and contended with. It would 
seem that the conditions of life today, 
especially to many women in England, 
are not satisfactory. In practice men 
have become more or less emancipated 
from the superstitions and traditions of 
the past. At last, women are revolting 
from the same conditions and the men. 
in their stupidity, do not seem to realize 
and appreciate the situation. However. 
it is only a matter of time. Women will 
get what they want, provided enough of 
them can agree on just what they do 
want. We believe in gradual advance- 
ment by dint of thought and experience, 
that is, in the reform of education. 

The writer of this little volume takes 
as types or leaders in the feminist move- 
ment today, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, 
Emeline Pankhurst and Jane Addams. 
Olive Schreiner and Isadora Duncan, 
Beatrice Webb and Emma Goldman. 
Margaret Dreier Robins, Ellen Key, and 
Dora Marsden, and briefly discusses the 
conception of life and woman's place 
therein as each has proclaimed the same. 

The chapters are not uninteresting and 
may be instructive to some, inasmuch as 
they give sketches of the social doctrines 
advocated by well-known women and 
writers. The book may provoke thought 
and further reading, which is the desir- 
able feature of any book,

MUTTON AND ITS VALUE IN 
THE DIET 

ANEW Government cook book, giv- 
ing more than eighty receipts for 
cooking mutton, and telling of the edible 
qualities and nutritive values of this 
meat, has just been issued by the De- 
partment of Agriculture. 

"Judged by its composition, palatabil- 
ity, wholesomeness, digestibility, relative 
cost, and the number of ways in which 
it can be prepared for the home table, 
mutton is an important food-stuff, which 
is well worth the attention of the house- 
keeper who wishes to provide her family 
with an attractive and palatable diet at 
a reasonable cost," the bulletin declares. 

Mutton, it declares, has always been a 
popular food in the Orient and among 
the Western nations. The ease with 
which the sheep is raised and the fact 
that its flesh is not, like some other 
meats, excluded on religious grounds 
from the dietary of any large group of 
people, combine with its palatibility to 
bring it into widespread favor. 

The terms "lamb" and "mutton" are 
somewhat loosely used to designate the 
meat obtained from the younger and 
older animals. 

"The general belief that mutton and 
lamb are wholesome has been strength- 
ened recently by such work as that of 
the Department of Agriculture, whose 
reports of meat inspection show that it 
has been necessary to reject relatively 
few mutton carcasses as unfit for food, 
and that the sheep is particularly free 
from diseases which make meat desir- 
able. 

"Pound for pound, mutton has a 
larger amount of tissue-forming sub- 
stances and a higher energy value than 
lamb. 

"Mutton and lamb are commonly be- 
lieved to digest readily without causing 
disturbance, and both experience and the

results of scientific investigation seem to 
bear out this belief. To this may be as- 
cribed the common use of mutton and 
lamb in invalid dietetics as well as in 
the daily fare." 

The bulletin gives the relative econ- 
omy in the use of mutton, and declares 
that if the flavor is not found palatable, 
there are many ways to overcome it. 
These methods are clearly explained, 
showing how the ancients prepared 
sauces that destroyed the mutton flavor. 
Housewives are advised to buy it in 
quantity for economy's sake, and they 
are instructed in methods of cutting, and 
the value of cuts. 

All different methods of cooking and 
preparing are explained in detail, not 
only from the point of palatability, but 
with consideration to digestibility and 
full food value. g. p. h.

As Mark Twain Looked at 
Himself 

Once in the course of a conversation, 
I had with him in Be,rmuda, says Mr. 
Paine, not long before the end, Mark 
forgot a word and denounced his poor 
memory: "I'll forget the Lord's middle 
name some time," he d roily declared, 
"right in the midst of a storm, when I 
need all the help I can get." 

"When I was young I could remember 
anything, whether it happened or not ; 
but I am getting old, and soon I shall 
remember only the latter." 

"I have tried to do good in this world, 
and it is marvelous in how many differ- 
ent ways I have done good, and it is 
comforting to reflect. Now, there's H. 
H, Refers — just out of the affection I 
bear that man, many a time I have given 
him points in finance that he never 
thought of — and if he could lay aside 
envy, prejudice and superstition, and 
utilize those ideas in his business, it 
would make a difference in his bank- 
account." 

"When the Czar of Russia proposed 
the disarmament of the nations, the late 
William T. Stead wrote for Mark 
Twain's opinion. He replied: 'The Czar 
is ready to disarm. I am ready to dis- 
arm. Collect the others ; it should not 
be much of a task now.' "

Simply Pure Leaf Fat 
Tried Out in Open Kettles 

No mystery about it— the process is old as the art of 
cookery. 

Pure leaf fat, carefully trimmed, slowly simmered in 
open kettles, strained, chilled, government inspected and 
sealed— that is Armour s '* Simon Pure^ Leaf Lard, 

Exactly the same pure leaf lard that careful house- 
wives made for themselves before the days of * 'Simon 
Pure'* because they knew that real leaf lard was necessary 
for good cooking.

One Practice House 



IT was not long after the beginning 
of the teaching of home-making that 
the need was felt of an opportunity 
to synthesize all the housekeeping pro- 
cesses, under the observation of the in- 
structor, and so to make a vital test of 
the availability of the knowledge gained 
in .the classroom. To prepare a single 
dish under carefiilly planned conditions 
is a wise preliminary to the preparation 
of a whole meal under ordinary home 
conditions, but the power to prepare a 
series of them perfectly does not always 
result in the power to serve the whole 
meal with each hot dish cooked to ex- 
actly the right point. "Dummy" table 
service is helpful as a preparation, but 
the actual service of a meal is almost an- 
other story. Laundering in the class, 
taking each type of article in orderly se- 
quence, and doing the week's * washing, 
are two problems differing in many 
ways. Learning to clean floors, walls, 
windows, glass, brass, silver, turning 
from one to the other, gives the necessary 
foundation, but cleaning a room or a 
house is a different matter. The theory 
of "doing" a bedroom is best tested by 
putting in order for the day an actual 
bedroom. 

No one doubts all this, but the prob- 
lem of providing for such applications 
is not an easy one. The first difficulty 
that confronts most schools is that of 



expense. A good deal of space must be 
set aside for the use of a comparatively 
few students at one time. Next come 
the difficulties of schedule. Only a small 
group of students can work profitably 
at such practice, simultaneously, and 
either they must lose some regular class 
work or the house will be little used and 
no student will get much practice. 

In some places students live in such a 
house, in groups, for a period of several 
weeks at a time, carrying on regular 
school work, and spending part of their 
time in housework. This would be an 
excellent method for the experienced, 
but the authorities of the School of 
Household Science and Arts of Pratt In- 
stitute hold that to the inexperienced this 
gives unsatisfactory results, since they 
cannot give enough time and thought to 
the planning of each detail to get the 
best out of the experience. They, there- 
fore, have arranged that each full-time 
student in household science shall stay 
away from the classes for one week, to 
give her whole time and attention to the 
housekeeping problem. Students from 
the senior normal household science and 
from the one-year course in institutional 
household science have this experience. 
The former carry on their practice 
teaching as usual during the week, but 
do no other school work. The making 
up of the week is not easy, but the value

of the practice week offsets the loss of 
lecture and laboratory. 

The Practice House of Pratt Institute 
is a three-story one in the near neighbor- 
hood of the Institute. It is not, of 
course, in a city like Brooklyn, a de- 
tached house, but one in a row. It is on 
a corner, and belongs to a group of 
houses built on Pratt Institute property, 
very attractive, and with the great ad- 
vantage of being heated and furnished 
with hot water from a central plant. A 
sketch of these houses is given in Mrs. 
Ellen H. Richards's "Cost of Shelter." 
The house has eight rooms, a bathroom, 
a cemented cellar, and an attic. There 
is a small lawn in front of the house, 
and a small garden at the back. A win- 
dow-box in the second story over the 
door makes the front of the house gay, 
without, from May to November. 

The furnishing of this Practice House 
was not done, as it has sometimes been 
done elsewhere, by the students as a 
school problem. The reason for this was 
that the house is to be used, year after 



year, by many generations of students, 
and it seemed wiser to have it represent 
the ideas and ideals of those responsible 
for its establishment rather than those 
of a single group of students. Only one 
group can have the actual experience of 
furnishing, since no school, any more 
than a family, can afford to refurnish 
every year. And. indeed, even were it 
a financial possibility, such an arrange- 
ment would be totally destructive of the 
home atmosphere A house is not fur- 
nished, once for all, as planned and fin- 
ished. It grows gradually, by hardly 
perceptible accretions and assimilations, 
into an organic unity. 

The House was furnished as a family 
living in such a house could afford to 
furnish it. The House (including heat 
and hot water) rents for $47.50 a 
month, or $572 a year. This is a very 
low rent for such an attractive house 
in the city, but is the regular one for this 
house. The income would therefore, 
supposedly, be about $2500, although in 
Greater New York people with $2000

frequently pay as much. Throughout 
the House it was a temptation to use the 
resources of Pratt Institute in designing 
and making furniture and hangings, or 
in selecting wonderful bargains in old 
furniture, to be found by the person with 
the requisite knowledge and the time to 
"prowl" in the small second-hand shops. 
But. both temptations were resisted, in 
order to make the House more useful 
to everyone. It is not possible for the 
visitor to say : "It is all very well for you 
at Pratt Institute, but where am I to 
find such things?" The typewritten in- 
ventory, at the disposal of every visitor, 
gives names, addresses of maker or 
seller, and regular retail price of every 
article bought for the House, The little 
drawing-room is so small that, for the 
purposes of the House, it was necessary 
to provide more seats than an ordinary 
family would need, so a bench was de- 
signed to fit in under the shallow bay 
window, but this was the only thing 
made for the House. And even here the 
design is available to anyone who wishes 
to use it, and a working drawing from 



which any carpenter can construct the 
same bench. Hundreds of people have 
taken notes of names and addresses, in 
the three years the House has been in 
use, and there is nothing about the 
House that so impresses the average visi- 
tor as the many bits of practical infor- 
mation as to "where," and "how" and 
"why" that those showing it are always 
ready to offer. The House is also to the 
students a constant illustration of the 
school work in house planning and fur- 
nishing, and mistakes as well as suc- 
cesses are made clear to the students, 
and, indeed, to visitors. 

But the main use of the house is for 
the housekeeping experiment. Before 
this is described, a little more should be 
said about the arrangement of the house. 
The first floor contains a drawing room 
(IS'xlff), a dining room (14'x 15'), a 
butler's pantry, and a kitchen (It/xlS'). 
The cellar is cemented and whitewashed, 
and cont^iins a curtained corner for stor- 
age of trunks and extra furniture, a 
storeroom for household supplies (little 
used because of special conditions), a 



102

toilet and the laundry equipment — set 
tubs, two-burner gas stove, ironing table, 
racks, and the rest. The cellar has an 
entrance into the back garden, where, of 
course, the laundry is dried. The second 
floor has a sitting room (ICXxS') for the 
instructor in charge of the house, with a 
small bedroom (8'S"x6'3") adjoining, a 
bedroom (n'O-'xlCe") for the second 
instructor who rooms here, in order that 
the first may not be left alone over 
Sunday, a linen closet, a bedroom 
(IZ'xlO'S") for two, with single beds, 
with a writing table and dressing table 
as well as a chiffonier, and a bathroom. 
The top floor has a large gabled room 
(13'5"xl7') across the front, which is 
known as the "institutional" room, with 
painted walls, cork carpet on the floor, 
white enameled furniture, and four nar- 
row white beds, all in a row. The attic 
at the back is ventilated by a skylight, 
and an extra bath has been put here, as 
too many people are in the house for 
one bathroom. The floor of the whole 
attic is covered with cork carpet, and 



CORNER OF BBDROOU 



aside from the bathroom furnishings it 
has only a cedar chest for blankets and 
a matting box for clothing. It is cer- 
tainly the largest bathroom ever known 
in a house of this size ! 

As has already been stated, two in- 
structors live at the House and when 
the House is in full operation {from 
January to April, in order to give each 
student her experience,) a group of six 
students comes in each Monday morning 
after breakfast and stays until Saturday 
afternoon. Groups who vote to do so 
may remain over Sunday, but this is not 
required. The group receives $20. and 
must buy from this all food supplies, 
ice, and kitchen cleaning materials. 
Only one student sits at the table for 
each meal, the others being servants for 
the day, while she is hostess. The in- 
structor in charge is always at the table, 
and there are two guests. Even the in- 
viting of the guests is part of the prob- 
lem, as all must be asked by note, and 
each note shown to the instructor. 

A brief calculation will show that food 
has to be provided for nine people, and 
for sixteen meals. This is an average of 
nearly I4c a meal, although, of course, 
it would be divided differently — perhaps 
10c for breakfast, 12c for luncheon, and 
20c for dinner. Breakfast must have 
three courses, luncheon three, and dinner 
four, with coffee. It is a constant source 
of wonder to those who visit the house 
that such good meals are served, with 
such a close money limitation. The in- 
structor in charge says that the students 
do it by wise planning of the use of 
everything edible. Not long ago one of 
the graduates of the institutional house- 
hold science course took charge of the 
dining room of a school of over five 
hundred students and, when she had been 
there three weeks, the man holding the 
contract for the removal of garbage 
went to the president of the institution 
to complain. "See here." he said. "Since 
that new dining-room manager came I 
don't get one-fifth the garbage I've al- 
ways had!" Which is an illuminating

comment. 

There are certain specifications about 
the week's food, such as that waffles, 
griddle cakes, and popovers shall be 
served each week, at least, once, that all 
bread shall be made, that there shall be 
two frozen desserts and one layer cake 
each week, but apart from this the plan- 
ning of the menus is left entirely to the 
students. After the meal has been 
served the instructor in charge makes (in 
private) any criticisms she has to offer 
on the selection of food, the preparation, 
and the service. Each day's meals must 
be well balanced, but exact calculations 
are not required in this problem, as they 
are not necessary in the house ordinarily. 
A typical day's menu is one served on 
Thursday, March 13: 

Breakfast 

Grape fruit 

Cream of Wheat Sugar Cream 

Bacon Toast 

Coffee 

Luncheon 

Lentil Soup 

Rtce-and-meat mold Bread 

Orange Cakes Orange Sauce 

Tea 

Dinner 

Oyster Cocktail 

Planked Steak Duchess Potatoes 



Escaloped Onions StulTed Peppers 

Cress -and- Cheese Salad 

Ginger Cream 

Coffee 

Each group takes the inventory of 
kitchen and dining-room at the begin- 
ning and end of the week. Each keeps 
exact accounts, which must be handed in. 

The group duties are divided as fol- 
lows: hostess, cook, kitchen maid, wait- 
ress, chambermaid, and laundress. Each 
member of the group assumes each of 
these positions for one day. The hostess 
receives guests, sits at the table as host- 
ess, does the marketing, and in other 
ways fulfills the duties and exercises the 
privileges of the mistress of the house. 
The cook prepares all food, and directs 
the kitchen maid, who assists her. The 
waitress serves the meals, washes the 
dishes from the dining-room, prepares 
butter balls and salads, answers the 
door-bell, except at meal times, and 
cleans the first floor, except the kitchen. 
The chambermaid does all cleaning on 
the second and third floors. The cleaning 
is arranged in a series of special tasks, 
whose accomplishment keeps the house 
in as nearly perfect condition as it is

possible to keep such a house in a city. 

The entire work of the House is done 
by the group. But the atmosphere of 
the House, speaking psychologically, is 
quite as delightful as its spotlessness and 
order. The spirit of, hospitality reigns. 
Occasion has often arisen to ask extra 
guests to luncheon or dinner, when visi- 
tors have appeared unexpectedly at the 
School, and at such times the offer is 
always made to add the proper amount 
to the budget for the week, but the stu- 
dents have always refused such offers, 
and have stretched the $20 to cover just 
a little more. Early in the life of the 
House it was found necessary to confine 
visitors to one day of the week, in order 
not to interrupt the students too much, 
and Friday afternoon was chosen. A 
few weeks after this was started, the 
students asked if they might not serve 
tea to those who came. They explained 
that it seemed so inhospitable not to of- 
fer refreshments, and that they could 
easily provide it on the budget. So tea 
is regularly served. From ten to twenty 



visitors are expected every Friday, and, 
on an average, every other Friday some 
special group is asked, either of students, 
instructors, alumnae, or neighbors. No 
group has ever exceeded its budget, and 
every group this year has had a balance 
of from ten to thirty-five cents. 

When the regular work of the House 
is not going on, several students live 
there, who receive their room in return 
for keeping the house in order. No 
cooking is done in the House at this 
time, except as special luncheons, dinners 
or teas are given. These are frequent, 
and the Alumnae Associations are al- 
ways especially welcome. To make a 
real home as part of a school, and with 
a constantly changing family, is difficult, 
yet in a way it has been accomplished at 
the Practice House of the Pratt Institute 
School of Household Science and Arts. 
The alumnae and the graduating classes 
make gifts to the House, and feel both 
pride in it and that sense of ownership 
that comes only with a real personal 
relation. An Instructor. 



INSTITUTIONAL-ROOM, HAVING FOUR BEDS 



How Miss Janet Grew Young 



By Alix Thom 



IT was the yellow Angora that be- 
gan it, yes, that wrought the mi- 
racle, and the yellow Angora 
never knew it. But this little story 
begins before ever the Angora came to 
stay at Meadowville with Miss Janet. 

One October morning Miss Janet 
Farrington, wealthy spinster, gave a 
quick glance out of the library win- 
dow by which she was sitting, and 
then called shrilly to her maid: 

"Mary, run right out and send those 
children home, they will surely break 
the hedge if they press so hard against 
it. Oh, why must a family with young 
children move next door to me." 

The voice of the obedient Mary 
could be heard a moment later, rising 
high above the protesting childish 
tones — "Well, I can't help it, Miss 
Janet says you must go right out of 
the yard. Fm sorry if you can't find 
it, but you shouldn't play so near our 
hedge." 

" 'Twas a ball that was lost," ex- 
plained Mary as she passed through 
the room, "the little Burnett boy, 
Jacky is his name, cried, Mam; 'twas 
a new ball I think, from what his sis- 
ter said." 

"Well, well," and Miss Janet bent 
over her writing, "I cannot have them 
trampling over my lawn, like young 
colts." 

She shook her head severely at two 
small girls who lingered near the ter- 
race, on their way to school, as she 
went out to do her marketing. 

"Hurry along, children," she called, 
"hurry along," and hurry along they 
did, cheeks pinker, and casting sur- 
prised backward looks at the tall lady 
in the blue gown whose hair was plen- 
tifully sprinkled with gray, and whose 
firm lips seemed to have forgotten how 
to smile. 



«' 



*tTf. 



The very next morning it was that 
Miss Janet received a letter that so 
surprised her that she read it once, 
read it quite through again, and then 
called in Mary, her long-time maid, to 
read -it to her. "Listen, Mary, will 
you," she began, "for the news, the as- 
tonishing news this letter contains 
eflFects you, too, listen!" 

And this was the letter that caused 
such consternation in the stately old 
brown house, that October morning, 
when all the world seemed red and 
gold, and the sun, shining through 
gaily-tinted leaves, gave the effect of 
stained glass windows. 
My very dear Janet — 
I'm sending you, I have sent you, 
for the expressman has just driven 
away with the box, the dearest yellow 
Angora kitten, five months old, who 
rejoices in a glorious tail, large eyes 
and the beginnings of a ruff which 
bids fair to be a very splendid one. I 
own his mother, Lady Goldie, and I 
can assure you that he is a very pedi- 
greed pussie. I didn't wait to ask you 
if you wanted him, for no one could 
help but want such a yellow Angora. 

"The cat book I am mailing you will 
tell you about his feeding; follow it 
and you will have no trouble. He 
should make a fine large cat, perhaps 
he will weigh fifteen pounds, yet. I 
feel sure both you and Mary will take 
him to your hearts, and I wanted him 
to have just such a good home. 

"Accept with much affection, this 
dearest pussie, and believe me, 

"Your loving cousin, 

"LENA. 
"P. S. His name is Alladin, and 
he's due to arrive Thursday." 

"Mary, oh Mary, what shall we do!" 
cried Miss Janet helplessly, "a kitten 
and an Angora one at that, coming to 
105 



106

this house as fast as the train can 
bring it. If it isn't just like Lena 
Bullard," she said more to herself than 
to her domestic, "always doing the un- 
expected. Mary, why, "turning a 
troubled face to the girl's flushed one, 
"I haven't had a pet in years, as you 
know. I was fond of cats when I was 
a young girl at home, but the care of 
a blooded cat, its terrible." 

"And today is Wednesday," was 
Mary's discouraging reply, "sure he'll 
be here in no time, this Angola, if 
that's what you call him." 

"Angora," repeated Miss Janet, pa- 
tiently, "my cousin says she has named 
him Alladin; what an outlandish name 
for a cat." 

Mary's face grew reminiscently 
cheerful, as she turned to leave the 
room — "I remember the young cats in 
the barn, that I played with when I 
was but a child on the farm, and how 
they would act, the troop of 'em, as if 
they tried to tear the hayloft to 
pieces." 

"Mary, Mary," and Miss Janet fairly 
turned pale, "what won't a kitten do to 
this house! Lace curtains, rugs, bric- 
a-brac, and oh," with a hopeless wave 
of her hands that took in the library, 
the prim parlor beyond, and the dining 
room across the hall, "think of it, fif- 
teen pounds, did she say?. Why, we 
might as well keep a dog." 

The book on cats, arrived in the first 
delivery next morning, was despair- 
ingly perused by Miss Janet, and then 
handed over to Mary to read. 

The morning paner that lay folded 
by her plate at breakfast gave a 
lengthy account of the cat show then 
being held in New York, and dis- 
played pictures of the fluffy prize win- 
ners. Miss Janet had never before felt 
enough interest in the subject to ex- 
amine such accounts, but now she ad- 
justed her glasses, and painstakingly 
studied the awe-inspiring lists of pedi- 
greed pets, and their hyphenated 
names. 



At noon, a short sharp bark, sound- 
ing under her window, caused her to 
look out, and she saw a fleeing black 
and white cat, scurrying across the 
next yard, pursued by a fat fox terrier 
who stood small chance of catching 
up with his nimble quarry. Suppose, 
she asked herself, suppose that cat had 
been her yellow Angora, what then, 
oh, what then! 

Slowly the day passed, every roll of 
wheels near the house she was sure 
was the express wagon, bringing her 
the undesired pet. Five times had she 
hurried to the front door, only to see 
some delivery wagon, passing leisurely 
along. But it was nearly dinner time 
that Mary knocked at Miss Janet's 
door, and managed to ejaculate, "Oh 
Mam^ it's come, it's here, the Angola. 
The expressman, he says, where'U he 
take the box !" 

Outwardly calm, her mistress de- 
scended the stairs, directed that the 
box be set down in the library, and 
waited while the trembling Mary 
wrenched off one of the slats, and out 
stepped a thankful, much traveled 
pussie, who stretched his yellow paws, 
mewed softly, then threw himself in a 
tumbled heap at the feet of his new 
owner. 

"Well, he is cunning," remarked 
that lady grudgingly, "and see, Mary," 
touching his roughened coat with one 
slim hand, "see, how soft his fur is!" 

Mary, predestined to be his bond 
slave, was down on her knees before 
him, stroking the very appreciative 
Alladin, and talking to him as if he 
were in truth a frightened child. 

"You poor little fellah, you poor An- 
gola, and are you done up! So you 
are. And what shall we give him for 
his supper. Mam! Sure his little 
stomach must be empty enough." 

"Scalded milk with bread or cereal, 
the book says," quoted Miss Janet as if 
she were reciting a lesson, "a small 
portion of boiled meat cut up in small 
pieces, at noon, and more milk, at 



HOW MISS JANET GREW YOUNG

night. Puppy biscuit is always safe. 
Diet to be enlarged as he grows older. 
Hasn't he an intelligent face, Mary, 
very different from an ordinary cat. 
Notice his eyes !" 

**Yes, sir, you are different," said 
Mary, gathering him up in kind arms 
and bearing him oflF to the kitchen, 
stroking his fat yellow paws as she 
went, while the Angora's reply to all her 
attentions was a series of deep breathed 
purrs. 

That night, Alladin slept peacefully 
on the chintz-covered window-seat in 
Miss Janet's bed room, and next morn- 
ing, after his modest breakfast, started 
on a tour of the house, exhibiting the 
most shocking curiosity over even the 
most obscure closets. But it was the 
day after his arrival that his kittenship 
began to discover that an alluring out- 
doors lay beyond the fast closed win- 
dows. An out-doors where little mis- 
chievous breezes tossed unwary yellow 
and crimson leaves, in tantalizing 
fashion, across lawns, into corners of 
flower beds, and over hedges, and he 
longed with all his kitten heart to join 
the play. Why, he asked himself, 
should he be condemned to dull unin- 
teresting rooms, when all these sur- 
prising happenings were going on 
about him? And he scratched on the 
pane with one foolish ineffectual paw. 

"Oh, Mary," cried Miss Janet, her 
hand involuntarily straying to Al- 
ladin's downy head, "the poor thing 
wants to go out. When can we let 
him in the yard? He is so young, so 
very young, you know, Mary." 

"I might try him out in the back 
yard this afternoon. Mam," was the 
reply. "He's got to get wonted." 

And take him out she did, and Al- 
ladin, escaping from her detaining 
clasp, rushed delightedly forth, evi- 
dently eager for new yards to conquer, 
for he made a quick dive under the 
hedge, emerging triumphant in the 
next yard. 

Out hurried Miss Janet, in answer to 





Mary's frightened call, but before she 
could skirt the hedge, a childish voice 
called from behind the green barrier, 
"Here's your kittie. Miss Janet, 1 
caught him," and the little brown-eyed 
Burnett girl, smiling shyly, came up 
the steps, her arms filled by a strug- 
gling yellow kitten. Impetuously the 
child pressed a swift kiss upon the 
head of the Angora, and handed him to 
his owner. 

"Thank you, child," said Miss Janet 
graciously, adding, quite to her own 
surprise, "come over and see my pus- 
sie, some day." 

"Oh, I will," glowed the small 
neighbor, "I guess I never saw such a 
beautiful kittie cat." 

"That's a kind, bright little girl, 
Mary," was Miss Janet's comment, as 
they entered the house. 

"But," and the astonished Mary 
opened her blue eyes wide, " 'tis one of 
those Burnett children, Jackie's sister." 

Her mistress had gone into the din- 
ing room, so possibly did not hear the 
remark. 

The week following, Alladin escap- 
ing from Miss Janet, frolicked away 
to the wide alluring street, and spying 
an approaching terrier, climbed a near- 
by tree, as handily as any unpedigreed 
feline might. Once up in the mysteri- 
ous, sheltering branches, he refused to 
come down, though the dog had peace- 
fully trotted away, mounting higher, 
and ever higher. 

Tommie Drayton, Knight-errant, 
aged eleven, from his piazza, four 
houses below, viewed the tragedy, and 
sauntered over to see what might be 
done for an evidently distressed lady. 

"Aw, that's nothing," he observed, 
as he swung himself up into the tree, 
and speedily brought down Alladin, 
trembling, yet ready for more adven- 
tures, as is the way of kittens. 

"That is a nice boy, Mary, a promis- 
ing one," remarked Miss Janet, as she 
deposited the kitten in the largest 
chair in the library, "I must give him

sohie pears from the tree by the grape- 
vine, they are unusually fine, this year. 
I remember my brothers loved pears 
when they were youngsters — " 

And Mary didn't smile until she 
reached her familiar kitchen ways. 

Little Katherine, from across the 
way, found Alladin, next afternoon, 
wandering unconcernedly down the 
side street, evidently headed for the 
business section of the town, and tuck- 
ing him securely under her arm, re- 
turned him to his unappreciated home. 
Poor Miss Janet was on the lawn call- 
ing for her missing pet. 

"Why, why, you dear child, it's very 
good of you to take this trouble. I am 
so afraid he will get lost," she said, 
holding out her arms for the yellow 
Angora, "I don't know how I could 
get along without you children. Yes, 
certainly, go in and have a play with 
him, if you want to." 

Gradually Miss Janet's viewpoint 
was changing. Now, when she met 
her young neighbors in the street, she 
smiled in answer to their smiles. 
Sometimes a little boy or girl would 
hurry to catch up with her, and why 
not, when they always desired to talk 
of Alladin! And often, in the days 
that followed, she would find a child 
in her yard, watching the graceful kit- 
ten, as he leapt lightly for elusive but- 
terflies or birds. 

Alladin, as Mary expressed it, was at 
last getting wonted, and could be safe- 
ly left to his own desires, as said de- 
sires were generally to play in his own 
or nearby yards. 

And then one day, a Saturday it 
was, the yellow Angora was missing. 
Miss Janet had not seen him since 
breakfast, and Mary was sure that she 
hadn't had a look at him, in a good 
four hours. Vainly they called from 
doors and windows, from the yard, 
looked up and down the street, and 
Mary finally decided to announce the 
loss to the small Burnetts, who would 
be sure to give a general alarm. They 



made haste to inform the startled 
neighborhood, and out flocked the 
children over to Miss Janet, inquiring, 
condoling, mourning with her, and 
then forming themselves into search 
parties scattered in all directions. But 
to no avail. Miss Janet wept secretly, 
and Mary openly. Unrebuked, the 
children trooped over Miss Janet's vel- 
vety lawn, for were they not searching 
for the dear lost Alladin? Unregard- 
ed, they pushed through openings in 
the trim hedges, rung the door-bell 
numberless times, left the prints of 
small, dusty shoes on the tidy piazza, 
finger-prints on the French windows, 
and Miss Janet never minded. 

Two hours after, Mary discovered 
the missing Angora, sound asleep in 
the linen closet, at the back of the 
house, unmindful of the anxiety he 
had caused. Miss Janet recalled put- 
ting away some towels soon after do- 
ing her marketing, and he must have 
followed her in, only to find himself 
a captive among the piles of lavender- 
scented linen. 

Convulsively his mistress embraced 
him, whispering to the still drowsy 
Alladin, that he was a very naughty 
pussie to so frighten them all. 

Why, he was more precious than 
ever, this pet of hers, since the fright 
he had given them. 

From her piazza she addressed the 
forlorn group of weary children, who, 
having given up the hunt, had re- 
turned to report their failure. 

"He's here, Alladin has been found. 
He was all this time shut in the linen 
closet up stairs, peacefully taking a 
nap, while we've been searching for 
him. But, oh, children, I do thank you 
for the way you have helped me. Al- 
ladin would thank you, too, if he 
could. I am sure that he loves you all, 
and dears, I want to tell you that I 
am going to give you a party, a week 
from today, a really splendid party, 
with a Jack Horner pie, music, games, 
ice cream and the rest, and I thall ex*

pcct you all. The yellow Angora will. 
I am sure, help entertain my com- 
pany." 

"We'd love to come, Miss Janet," 
they cried, their happy faces raised to 
hers, and away they trooped, talking 
of the joys to come. 

So this is how Miss Janet grew 



young, how the stone rolled away 
from her cold stern heart, how love 
and gentleness stole in, and little chil- 
dren's lives began to touch hers. All 
because of a yellow Angora; yes, it 
was the yellow Angora that wrought 
the miracle. Who can foresee the mys- 
terious influence of small things? 



Efficiency in Home-Making 

By Fannie Wilder Brown 



IF we watch an efficient machine in 
action, we shall see that each part 
is designed to accomplish its office 
with as little unnecessary motion, and 
as little friction, as possible. We shall 
see that the value of the whole ma- 
chine depends upon its ability to pro- 
duce creditable work, useful or orna- 
mental, with as little waste of material 
and of power as possible. We women 
boast of our brains, and claim to be 
self-directive and self-adjusting. We 
are seeking to enlarge our "sphere" in 
every direction, to get out of the ruts 
we have been in so long, to be "more 
than a mere machine," to share in the 
task of steering the Ship of State, of 
helping to rule in National affairs. We 
claim the right to vote. 

While we are clamoring so loudly 
for increased responsibilities, do we 
not find ourselves face to face with the 
question. How have we succeeded with 
the responsibilities and opportunities 
we have had for so long? Can we 
avoid secretly guaging our ability to 
do more by applying the efficiency test 
to what we have been accomplishing — 
or not accomplishing — as makers of 
homes? For the sake of illustration, 
suppose we watch a printing press or 
a steam engine awhile, and compare 
results. How much of the work we do 
would be creditable to a first-class ma- 
chine, and how about our waste of 
material, waste of power, poorly 



adapted and poorly adjusted means to 
ends? How about friction? 

The Japanese have a proverb, "If 
you know how, it is easy. If it is hard, 
you don't know how." Isn't a large 
part of our domestic problem involved 
in the fact that we don't yet know how 
to keep house, how to be altogether 
satisfactory wives and mothers, in 
short, how to make a home? 

If we choose any other career, we 
expect to take time to be taught its 
principles and to practise them until 
we have won skill, and then to serve a 
sort of apprenticeship, at a low wage, 
to acquire experience, proficiency, be- 
fore daring to pose as capable of earn- 
ing full pay; and a position of man- 
ager or director is (or should be) se- 
cured only by achieving unusual skill 
and executive ability long after all the 
details of the business or profession 
have become automatic. 

We marry a man earning say from 
twenty-five to fifty dollars a week (be 
it more or less, the principle is the 
same), and are justly indignant if any- 
body hints that we are not his intel- 
lectual equal ; but when we first begin 
to keep house, most of us prove to be 
so poorly trained for our share of 
home-making that we can't begin to 
run the place as well as a maid-of-all- 
work whom we think we ought to be 
able to hire for five dollars a week and 
her room and board I

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



We come to a certain (or uncertain) 
amount of efficiency, sooner or later, 
in most cases, through failure and 
tears and agony and many a ship- 
wreck, but the point being considered 
is this: We require men to qualify 
themselves for their life-work and get 
a start in it, require them to demon- 
strate their competence, before they 
undertake to win us as wives, and we 
are not playing a fair game unless we 
qualify ourselves and demonstrate our 
competence for our kind of work as 
well, before we accept the position. 

If we undertook any other business, 
with such lack of efficiency, we should 
soon be discharged, and that with 
scant courtesy. Is it any wonder that, 
sometimes, we are discharged? The 
wonder is how seldom, if ever, we real- 
ize that this is what has happened to 
us ! Far oftener than being discharged, 
we desert our post. We act like a self- 
ish or a sulky youngster who doesn't 
understand a game, or who won't 
abide by its rules. He rushes from the 
playground home to his mamma, bawl- 
ing back over his shoulder, "I won't 
play with you any more, so now, boo- 
hoo! boo-hoo!" If his mother is wise, 
she tells him to be a man, and go back 
and learn to play his game, but those 
of us who are deserters from the game 
of life seldom have wise mothers at 
our backs. We sulk and grieve in idle- 
ness, or think we are brave if we brace 
up and try to find another partner, or 
try to take up some other sport. We 
blame the partner we have had, though 
he may have been the one man in all 
the world to us, for our unfortunate 
failure, instead of inquiring how much 
of the trouble was due to friction, and 
realizing that friction shows a machine 
to be in poor condition or poorly 
adapted to its use. 

Do you dispute this? Are we as a 
whole, or are any large number of us, 
who are home-makers, women whose 
works praise us in the gates, women 
whose children rise up and call us 



blessed, women in whom the hearts of 
our husbands may safely trust? 

We notice that our husband does not 
sweep out his store or office, doesn't 
answer his doorbell and telephone, 
doesn't attend to his own routine work, 
and we understand that he is too val- 
uable a man to do those things for 
himself, understand that it is for the 
interests of his business that his time 
and skill shall be used to better advan- 
tage. But the chances are that he had 
no help until he had made his time 
worth enough so that he could afford 
to hire the drudgery done. This is not 
a case of leaving disagreeable work to 
be done by another, not a case of feel- 
ing above sweeping floors and wash- 
ing windows. It is a case of having 
developed ability to be of greater use 
by exercising oneself in some other 
way. 

If, as home-makers, we can put our- 
selves to more valuable uses, can at- 
tain better results, greater efficiency, 
by hiring the rougher parts of our 
work done' by some one whose muscles 
are her most efficient part, by all 
means let us do so, for her sake as well 
as for our own. This is exactly as a 
stronger bar of iron is used to bear a 
heavier strain in a complex machine, 
while a highly tempered bit of steel 
serves a different purpose, and a rod 
of polished brass a third. But if we 
substitute hired help, not in order to 
serve the home better by doing more 
skilled work, but because we are in- 
capable of doing even cheap work ; and 
if, having put another in our place, we 
use our time and strength and abili- 
ties outside of our awn especial prov- 
ince, the home, or if we waste our- 
selves idly, — well, we can imagine 
what would have happened to our hus- 
band's business, if he had attempted to 
carry it on in any such way as that! 
If our sons never marry, if our daugh- 
ters elope with the chauffeur, and if 
our husbands find an affinity, we shall 
have only ourselves to blame 



AN AUGUST SONG 



111 



Many a woman feels that her ability 
does not lie along the line of domestic 
accomplishment, feels that she can serve 
the interests of the home better by hiring 
help and earning money outside of its 
walls than by making herself proficient 
in the multiplex duties she must master 
in looking well to the ways of her house- 
hold. The keenest observers, however, 
agree unanimously that, under normal 
conditions, no amount of money an aver- 
age woman can earn makes up for the 
loss of her personal presence in the 
home, either carrying on or directing 
the processes necessary to the well-being 
of its inmates. If she has sufficient e3t- 
ecutive ability to do this well, producing 
results of as high a class as would be 
demanded of her by any other business 
or profession she might engage in, and 
if, in addition to all this, she has time and 
energy and skill to use elsewhere, before 
she diverts her superfluous ability away 
from her family and home, let her ask 
how she shall use the money she earns? 

Most of us work like the Irishman 
who was out in a pouring rain digging a 
ditch in the mud. Asked why he was 
doing it, he replied, "Begorry, I'm dig- 
gin' the ditch to earn money to buy 
bread to give me strength to dig the 
ditch." We earn money to buy food to 
gain strength to earn more money, in 
an unceasing round, and if by an unex- 



pected or unusual turn of Fortune's 
wheel we reach the lone peak whence we 
cry "I have enough ; I will now sit down 
and enjoy it," straightway we find our- 
selves in the clutches of Nemesis. We 
can't be easy sitting still for five minutes, 
and no capacity for enjoyment is to be 
found in all that remains of our money- 
breeding lives. 

When we women shall have gained 
equal suffrage, and established a single 
standard of morality, and righted the 
wrongs of our horribly unjust industrial 
conditions, and seen to it that all have 
equal opportunities and living wages, 
how little danger is to be feared of our 
not making money enough to live com- 
fortably upon, of our not being able to 
rise to unimagined heights of material 
prosperity I But look at the way we are 
rushing into business and into profes- 
sional life, look at the reluctance of men 
to undertake the maintenance of a home, 
in the face of the swift evolution of our 
sex, and look at the flooded divorce 
courts, strewn with wrecks of homes of 
every class and every description, and 
then figure our comparative ability to 
make a success of our homes 1 There 
lies the fate of love and life, the biggest 
problem our sex has to face, the gravest 
danger to our Nation, and the future of 
our children's children — the existence of 
the race. 



An August Song 

Soft blow the winds, dear heart, 

Sweet is the garden's bloom; 
Come, shall we steal apart 

Into the sheltered gloom. 
Soft are your hands and white, 

Your lips are the roses' hue, 
Close in my arms tonight, 

Dear, I shall cuddle you. 

Fair are the stars and bright. 

Lightly the dew drops fall, 
Naught shall thy dreams afright. 

Fondly the night birds call. 
Rippling the brooklet wends. 

Heavens are blue above, 
Sleep while thy mother tends, 

Baby, my own, my love. 

L. M. Thornton. 



The Golden Years 



By Eleanor Robbins Wilson 



AROUSED by the friendly touch 
of modernity, the present-day 
Sleeping Beauty has awakened 
and we who are beginning to accustom 
our vision to all sorts of marvelous 
sights are not surprised to find that she 
is a creature of maturity, — ^a woman 
strengthened and glorified by experience. 

A pet feminine fallacy has perished 
and Madame Middle-Age, who once so 
graciously tendered the palm of the 
Golden years to Youth and then went 
"away back and sat down," has at last 
swung open the gates of her shut-in 
country and come into the realm where 
dreams come true. 

It isn't so very long ago that the wom- 
an entering the blessed state of matri- 
mony felt constrained to surrender all 
ambitions save those bounded by the 
four walls of domesticity. 

Who cannot recall, at random, count- 
less clever young matrons who in laying 
away the wedding gowns and bridal 
bouquets made the mistake of folding in 
their individualities? She who was 
gifted with originality of expression, un- 
der pressure of new tasks, laid by a 
promising quill, the musician allowed 
her nimble fingers to stiffen, and the art- 
ist forgot her brushes. Into the gigantic 
slot machine of matrimony each dropped 
a promising talent and then, somehow, 
the springs of inspiration ceased to work, 
and all for the want of a little persistent 
effort ! 

Not so with the woman who has cher- 
ished her pet ambitions, who has let no 
barrier of selfishness or indifference bar 
her from the full cultivation of her per- 
sonality, for it is not only possible for 
the housewife to maintain some interests 
foreign to household duties, — it is prac- 
tically necessary in building a well- 
rounded life. 

One of the most successful wives I 



know, a mother of eight children, is an 
untiring club worker and her papers on 
child training are something illuminat- 
ing. 

The day of shelving middle-aged 
women has gone by, the hands of ma- 
tuity are no longer folded hands, for the 
chimney-side recluse of a century ago 
has been replaced by a resplendent being, 
crowned with the wisdom of the golden 
yea'rs. 

The test of living is unfailingly an- 
swered in middle life, the most promis- 
ing woman in youth is only a fraction, 
after passing the half-way milestone, she 
is either a telling integer or a cipher. 

The view-point of youth is invariably 
hampered by selfishness. Youth's joys 
are transporting and its sorrows corre- 
spondingly keen, but following this 
storm and stress epoch comes the mellow 
period of maturity, the day of quiet 
rapture and tempered disappointments, a 
day rendered worth while through 
trained efficiency and the happy art of 
canceling. 

I like to think of the victorious women 
who have looked on the absorbing occu- 
pations of wifehood and motherhood as 
a means of development, not as the end 
and goal of living. It was a wife and 
mother and a recruit from the ranks of^ 
middle-aged women, the wonderful Mad- 
ame Curie, you remember, who gave the 
world the priceless gift of radium. It is 
glorious Schumann-Heink, who, some- 
how, has managed to enchant us with 
grand opera arias while mothering a 
numerous progeny; and when that de- 
lightful novel, "The Rosary," came to 
us a few years ago, we were glad to find 
that the talented author, Mrs. Barclay, 
the busy wife of an English curate, 
mother of eight children, had at the age 
of fifty written the best selling story of 
the year. 



112 



THE GOLDEN YEARS 



113 



These woaen are what Bliss Carman 
would tcnn "Growers." "Growers," he 
declares, "are all those natural children 
of the earth, whether simplex or com- 
plex, who have cultivated the most 
fundamental principles of responsible 
living, a capacity for improvement and 
a hunger for perfection. And it is this 
trait of rational painstaking that lends 
the most sterling distinction to person- 
ality and differentiates leaders from fol- 
lowers, helpfulness from dependence, 
and the individual from the mass." 

"For growers there can be neither 
stagnation nor decay. They are like 
thrifty trees in the forest, deep rooted in 
the common soil of life from which they 
spring, deriving nourishment from the 
good ground of sympathy, stimulation 
and refreshment from the free winds of 
aspiration, producing perennially the 
flower and fruitage of gladness and well- 
being proper to their kind and enriching 
the earth. They are the normal ones, at 
once exemplars of all that is best in their 
species and the perpetuators of all that 
is most valuable." 

Not that always tucked away in the 
drab routine of domestic duties lies the 
thwarted flower of renown, but oh, so 
frequently deep down in scores of 
breasts of busy home-makers is im- 
planted the aspiration whose cultivation 
would make for a richer and happier 
life. 

And right here, were it my privilege to 
whisper a message to each prospective 
bride and young matron, it would be, as 
a side issue to housewifery, to foster the 
gift of individuality by some form of 
self-expression. It is the few moments 
devoted daily to such cherished ambi- 
tions that bee-like in the after years yield 
a treasury of sweetness. There is noth- 
ing much more forlorn than the middle- 
aged woman, who, after training her off- 
spring to self-reliant womanhood and 
manhood, says amen to her capabilities 
and sits down with the cipher contingent. 

Far be it from me to disparage the 
home and its sacred duties, but the home 



minus some other life-interest is warping 
in its tendency, and there ia evidence all 
along the connubial path where great 
capabilities have suffered ignominious 
death. Let us remember that little fin- 
gers do not cling always. There comes 
a margin of leisure to the busiest life 
wherein some cherished talent may be 
nursed into beauty, to the gratification of 
its possessor and the ultimate good of all 
concerned. 

Up in York state there used to be an 
old Dutch fruit peddler who, at times, 
carried a side-line of herbs, mint, sage, 
summer savory and the like. Smilingly, 
he used to confide that at certain seasons 
the side-line meant more to him than the 
apples and oranges. And so it is with 
life. There are times when the side-lines 
spell comfort, beauty, and even, as in 
the case of the humble Dutchman, pros- 
perity. 

I have in mind a Western artist, wife 
of a hustling professional man, whose 
manifold duties as a home-maker and 
mother of a family of five could not 
wholly obliterate her desire to reproduce 
on canvas the ever-changing pageantry 
of Nature. Each year the misty grays 
and green of Springtime, emerald and 
gold of Summer, the flaunting hues of 
gypsy-hearted Autumn, and soft white 
ways of Winter coaxed with insistent 
lure. As a result the neglected palette 
and brushes were called into play, and 
there appeared, from time to time, en- 
chanting bits of landscapes and water- 
scapes. This work was supplemented 
by a thorough study of ceramics and 
specialization in china decoration; then 
came the old, old story of the husband's 
financial reverses and his subsequent in- 
validism. A studio was opened and the 
rest of the story is summed up in one 
small word — success. To-day, the five 
children are happily ensconced in homes 
of their own. One son is one of Cali- 
fornia's leading surgeons, yet the wid- 
owed artist, now past the good ripe age 
of seventy, out of sheer joy of creation, 
still maintains her studio, painting with

the same finish and delicacy that have 
made her work famous. 

Into equally busy days another woman 
has contrived to crowd time for reading 
of permanent literature and to jot down 
some kaleidoscopic experiences of her 
own. Now and then, a fugitive poem 
from her pen found a home in some 
periodical of note, and, later on, owing 
to this self -same development, she has 
been able to transmute some gray years 
of loss and deprivation with the gold of 
service. 

There is still another home-keeper of 
my acquaintance, gifted with her needle, 
who now in the less strenuous period 
of the middle years is indulging her 
hobby. She fashions pretty and individ- 
ual gowns for herself, surprises her 
friends with dainty products of her 
needlecraft, and takes much pleasure in 
giving her services, teaching sewing in a 
small New England town where they are 
making heroic efforts to introduce voca- 
tional training in the schools. 



So, one by one, ambition leads them to 
the fruitage of the golden years. Twas 
here, after her fortieth birthday, that 
Harriet Beecher Stowe penned her im- 
mortal words ; 'twas here, after her for- 
tieth year, that Julia Ward Howe took 
up the study of Greek and became profi- 
cient therein, and it is here, after the 
half-century mark, that Ella Wheeler 
Wilcox is doing her best creative work. 
And so on might be mentioned the names 
of the arduous sowers of industry who 
have somehow caught "what the cen- 
turies are saying amid the wild chorus 
of the hours." 

For it is solely in this rugged realm of 
untiring endeavor that the zest of life 
flowers, and only the woman who proves 
herself stronger than her environment 
captures it. She alone who has proven 
herself a veritable feminine Hercules, by 
slaying all dragons of circumstance, can 
hope to win a peep into the gleaming or- 
chard of Hesperides and garner the 
riches of the Golden Years! 



September 



Frost in the air, and breezes blowing 

Chill from the West at morn. 
Crimson leaves on the maples glowing 

And gold of ripened corn. 
Song of the crickets, gaily calling, 

And drone of laggard bees: 
Seeds from a thousand seed-pods, falling 

Over a thousand leas. 
Be glad my heart, and a song of cheer 
Give to the world, when September's here. 



Sunshine and moonshine, changed 
altered, 

Haze over hill and lea, 
Even song of the brook has faltered. 

Crooning on toward the sea. 
Patter of nuts and acorns falling. 

Feast for the squirrels spread. 
Quails in the distant stubble calling 

And apples ripe and red. 
What if Winter is drawing near. 
Earth's at her best, September's here.

Perfume sweet where the wild grapes offer 

Wine that a king might praise. 
Fruits of the year in an open coffer, 

Gift of the passing days.

Toiler, turn from your toil, 
Follow the sumac's crimson streamer 

Back to the wood and soil. 
Steal one perfect day from a year 
Of toil or dreaming, September's here.

"Finding Ourselves in Wales** 



By Miss £. D. Learned 



A 



ND can you also board us?" we 
inquired of the woman whose 
lodgings we had been inspect- 
ing. "Oh, no," she said, "I had much 
rather you found yourselves." "But," a 
trifle puzzled, "if we find ourselves, 
where do we find ourselves?" The re- 
mark roused the Welsh sense of humor 
and she laughingly explained that "find- 
ing ourselves" meant buying our own 
provisions and sending them to our own 
apartment to, be cooked for us. House- 
keeping without the bother of servants 
and many other attendant worries. 

We had come to the west coast of 
Wales after a week of hot weather in 
London, feeling that the sea air would 
be most grateful, but unfortunately ar- 
rived about the first of August only to 
find rain and cold. 

The hotel overlooking the sea was 
only intended for warm weather, and 
the small fire places were quite inade- 
quate to warm .the large parlor and 
lounge, so there was nothing to do but 
huddle over tiny bedroom fires when we 
were not freezing in the large draughty 
dining room. 

The table was none too good and never 
made us forget pur discomfort. No use 
moving on, for we would probably go 
from one storm to another. We were 
a trifle discouraged, when a letter came 
from some friends asking us to look for 
lodgings for them, as they were anxious 
to be near us and did not wish the ex- 
pense of the hotel. 

Behold ! the lodgings sought for others 
looked so much more attractive and 
home-like than our own surroundings 
that we said "Why not try it ourselves? 
Join forces, making a party of eight, 
which just fills the house, and take it 
for the two weeks we expect to stay 
here?" 

The house was of stone, quite mod- 



ern, and though once we should have 
preferred something old and quaint, ex- 
perience had taught us that quaintness 
and age go hand-in-hand with discomfort 
and dirt, and we cared not for the pic- 
turesque, when we beheld the perfect 
cleanliness of our prospective lodging 
house. Set a little back from the 
road and much higher, you reached 
the entrance by a path arched over by a 
rose-covered trellis. In front was a 
charming little garden with seats in shel- 
tered nooks from which we could look 
out over the sea. Hedges of holly and 
fuschia separated the grounds from the 
neighboring houses. At the back rose 
the hills, the foot-hills of the Snowden 
mountain range. Penmaenmawr being 
the highest nearby, and too often cloud- 
capped, for "when the clouds hang on 
Penmaenmawr and the gulls do fly over 
the land, it is going to rain." 

The house consisted, for us, of a par- 
lor, dining room, two double and four 
single bedrooms, and could be had for 
ten guineas, or $52.50 a week, which in- 
cluded the use of bath, lights, cooking 
and attendance. Household linen and 
tableware were, of course, provided, 
which made it a little less than a dollar 
a day for each person. 

Now began the interesting part of see- 
ing, not only how much more comfort- 
able we could be, but how much less we 
could live on, than at the hotel. 

The first day's expenses must neces- 
sarily be large, as flour, sugar, coflfee, 
tea and other staples must be laid in. 
With a long list in hand we set forth on 
our venture at housekeeping in a strange 
land. The first check to our spirits came 
when we found that Monday, August 
5th, was a Bank holiday, so we couldn't 
draw on letters of credit, and as it had 
taken nearly all the ready money to pay 
the hotel bill, it was a serious problem to

purchase enough for the three meals that 
must be had before the bank went to 
work again. However, our landlady 
seemed to be a person of good and regu- 
lar standing in the community and all 
the shops were willing to trust us on 
hearing we were staying at "Bronwen- 
don", the Welsh name of our house, 
meaning, they told us, "the crest of the 
wave." We moved in just before lunch- 
eon on Monday and at one o'clock a neat 
looking maid in white cap and apron 
came to tell us that luncheon was served 
in the dining room. 

There was a beautifully clean, white 
cloth on the table, in the centre of which 
was a bunch of flowers; the china was 
pretty and attractive and the knives and 
forks fairly shone with polishing. 

Sardines, cold ham, hot brown bread 
scones, bought at a bakery, and straw- 
berry jam we had for our first luncheon. 
We waited on ourselves, ringing when 
anything was needed, and the neat little 
maid appeared as if by magic, so quiet 
were her movements. How we did en- 
joy that meal, and what a delight it was 
to be by ourselves and no longer have 
to talk in undertones lest the next table 
overhear. 

It was cold and windy, so we spent the 
afternoon by the grate fire until time for 
tea, which was served in the dining 
room, with as pretty and thin china cups 
as you would care to see, with toast and 
more strawberry jam. We gave the 
landlady an easy dinner that night, for 
not only was it a Bank holiday, but we 
had insisted on coming a day before she 
wanted us and her housewifely soul was 
troubled lest a speck of dust should be 
found. She had hot water bags in all the 
beds for a day or two before we came, 
to be sure that no dampness chilled us. 
We bought two small pork pies that only 
needed to be warmed, peas which we 
shelled ourselves, not because she asked 
it but knowing how long it would take 
one person and how short a time we 
could do them, together, in. We also had 
fried potatoes and a tomato salad, with 



a dessert of tarts, also from the bakery, 
and cream cheese. This for the first day 
of the experiment, which we were al- 
ready regarding as a success. 

Breakfast was ready at nine the next 
morning, oatmeal and cream, bacon, hot 
rolls and coffee. The best coffee we had 
since we had been in England, as we had 
our own coffee pot with us and it was 
made just to our liking. After breakfast, 
out for the day's supplies. The village 
street was close by and all the town 
seemed to be marketing. 

A few of the meals may be of interest 
in their resemblance to, or difference 
from, American housekeeping.

Dinner 

Baked Ham 

Mashed Potatoes Peas 

Small Fruit Tarts 

We found the bakery excellent, much 
better than we could find in America 
even in the large towns, and none of the 
bread was made in the house but all 
bought from the bakery. 

Tea was served every afternoon, when 
we were in, and we tried to keep some 
fruit on hand, though it was difficult to 
find it in any variety or good. Never 
before did we appreciate the wealth of 
fruit to be had at all seasons in the 
United States. 

Our landlady proved to be an excellent 
cook and made delicious pie-crust, so 



that we begged her to give us lessons, 
and one day gathered about the table, in 
her attractive, tiled-floor kitchen, to 
watch her make pastry and see if we 
could catch the knack. 

We allowed about $30 a week for pro- 
visions. The fire that we were obliged 
to keep in the living room was extra. 
The landlady and her little maid were 
most desirous to please us and they kept 
our rooms filled with fresh flowers, mak- 
ing it seem like home. 

It was not too cold for walks over 
the wonderful Welsh mountains, purple 
with heather bloom, and after our walks 
it was pleasant to come back to our own 
fireside. Altogether our experiment was 
a great success and, if we ever "find our- 
selves" again, may it be in Wales. 



The Lyric of Life 

Because the world seemed warped and 

wrong 
I stayed within to write a song: 

A rythmic woodland fancy. 
I wanted men to dance and sing 
With forest freedom; swirl and swing 

To nature's necromancy. 

The hill-sides called my truant mind; 
I turned away and drew the blind 

Against the sunny flickers; 
But though the gloom hung thick, I foutld 
I could not dull the luring sound 

Of laughing berry-pickers. 

And from the bridge there came a shout — 
My boy had duped a speckled trout: 

His first successful fishing; 
I pressed my eyes to cheat the tears, 
But still the outside charmed my ears — 

I could not stay the wishing. 

Then Lassie growled with discontent: 
The summer breeze had blown a scent 

Of strangers in the Hollow; 
And someone shouted loud my name — 
The echo charmed me; when it came, 

I knew that I must follow. 

Great God! to shut out sun and trees 
And then in gloom to sing of these! — 

My sin was past forgiving. 
Out doors I rushed with bursting heart, 
The sonff unsung; for art is art. 

But life is more — ^it's living! 

Jans Bun.

The Rainbow's Ejid 

O jeweled path to the world's desire! 

Just over the vale to the mountain's crest 
It bends its arch of rose and fire, 

And challenges all to the quest! 
Supernal beauty that never can fade, 

The perfect love that never can die. 
And purest gold of which dreams are made 

At the end of the rainbow liel 

But year by year the light that shone 

So near still travels before; 
And the world grows empty and dark and 
lone, 

And burdens weigh more and more! 
Alas, for the climbing through tangle and 
gloom 

The longing so vain and fond: 
The rainbow runs at last to the tomb 

And the treasure lies ever beyond! 

Stokely S. Fishes. 



VACATION 

ABOVE all others housekeepers need 
an occasional vacation. Change 
means rest, recuperation and renewed in- 
terest in one's tasks, hence follows better 
and more effective service. People who 
live in the country are apt to see too 
much of each other. Often it would 
seem wise, if individuals of the same 
family or who live in the same house did 
not take a vacation together and at the 
same time, and did not visit the same 
places. It were well for most of us, at 
times, to seek new and strange scenes 
or abide for a while, apart, in solitude. 
"Out of silence comes thy strength." 
From outings like these we return to our 
tasks refreshed and invigorated and the 
responsibilities of life seem less burden- 
some. After only a casual day .of recrea- 
tion, home may be much better appre- 
ciated, for no place can be just like home. 
At any rate, a vacation season for every- 
body who works is almost an imperative 
need ; and surely the advantages of it to 
the homemaker cannot be over valued. 

LETTERS AND LETTERS 

WE are in receipt, in the course of a 
year, of many a complaint from 
our subscribers that their letters are not 
answered, and, in some cases, we must 
admit the statement is true. For this rea- 
son, there are undoubtedly many people 
who feel ill towards us and speak evil of 
us to their friends and neighbors, which 
eventually may prevail even to the injury 
of our business and reputation. But how 
is it possible to answer a letter like the 
following, of which we receive not a few ?

ATTITUDE OF MIND 

IN all industrial pursuits today the 
mental attitude of the operator has 
come to be known as the factor of chief 
importance. Some one has said that 
"happiness consists in being well em- 
ployed and well compensated in some 
genial occupation", and who can refute 
the sentiment. In shop and factory effi- 
ciency experts are engaged in standard- 
izing the operations. This new idea, 
lately developed in business, is called effi- 
ciency or scientific management. It 
means that the men engaged in a certain 
industry are to do more work in less 
time with less waste and greater output, 
while the workers have shorter hours, 
higher pay and better working conditions. 
Now the question comes up to the home- 
maker, "If the principles of efficiency 
can be successfully carried out in every 
kind of shop, factory and business, why 
couldn't they be carried out equally well 
in the home ?" That is, can the principles 
of scientific management be applied in 
the home? This question is admirably 
discussed, we may add affirmatively, by 
the author of "The New Housekeeping", 
from which we quote the following pas- 
sage, somewhat appropriate, perhaps, to 
the vacation season: 

"Woman's vanity has often kept her 
from admitting that many of her prob- 
lems are so distressing simply because of 
her own lack of personal efficiency, not 
because of circumstances, fate, or other 
people. In most cases, however, she 



never even suspects that she is not as 
efficient as she might be, and points to 
the hard manual labor she does as 
proof of her efficiency — ^as if that didn't 
prove just the opposite! 

The efficient attitude of mind is really 
the balance-wheel to the homemakers' 
entire life and work. 

The end and aim of home efficiency is 
not a perfect system of work, or scien- 
tific scheduling, or ideal cleanliness and 
order ; it is the personal happiness, health 
and progress of the family in the home. 
The work, the science, the system, the 
schedule are but some of the means to 
that end, not the end itself. The 100 per 
cent, efficient person is not the one who 
tires himself out in a wonderful snarl of 
method and system — but who makes his 
mind so clear and efficient that both the 
work and the system are his slaves, when 
he gets into action. 

I do not call that woman efficient who 
thinks it a sacrilege to change her sched- 
ule of work, leave dishes unwashed and 
housd upset, to take advantage of a pleas- 
ant afternoon for a jaunt in the woods 
with the children. Neither do I call that 
woman efficient who complains that her 
schedule of work leaves her no time to 
read a good book or attend an afternoon 
musical or club meeting. Efficiency 
would be a sorry thing, if it simply meant 
a prison-like, compulsory routine of du- 
ties. But it does not mean this. Its very 
purpose is more liberty, more leisure, a 
shrewder sense of values, and the elimi- 
nation of wasted energy. 

I once knew a woman who dusted the 
back of every picture in her home every 
day. She believed this was real effi- 
ciency. I also knew a woman who 
spoiled a delightful camping experience 
by so elaborating the simple work of 
camp-caretaking that she rarely had time 
to enjoy the woods and fields so plentiful 
about her, and complained, after some 
months of camping, that she had never 
had a single day of rest ! This is typical 
of a large class of women whose sense of 
values is garbled by inefficient thinking."

FAILURE AND SUCCESS 

What is the main element of worldly 
success? Is it natural ability, opportur 
nity, favoring environment, or the help 
of influential friends? Evidently not, 
for thousands of men have climbed to 
the dizzy peaks of success with none of 
these aids. All experience shows that an 
ardent, thorough-going earnestness is the 
vital element in all great achievements, 
— the one thing for which there can be 
no substitute, and the lack of which ex- 
plains so many otherwise inexplicable 
failures in every calling. 

"You can only half will," was the lan- 
guage of Suvaroff, the Russian warrior, 
to those who fail. "You want to live like 
the butterfly, and yet have all the honey 
of the bee," said Pisistratus Caxton 
to Vivian, in Bulwer's novel; and these 
two sayings contain a satisfactory ex- 
planation of the great mass of failures 
in life. Nine-tenths of men's disappoint- 
ments and miseries come from the fact 
that they are not in dead earnest in their 
pursuits, and willing to pay the cost of 
the things they covet. They want wealth 
without earning it, popularity without 
deserving it, health without exercise and 
temperance, and happiness without holi- 
ness. The man who covets the best 
things, and is willing to pay exactly what 
they are worth in honest effort and hard 
self-denial, will have no difficulty in get- 
ting what he wants. It is the men who 
want goods on credit that are snubbed 
and disappointed, and overwhelmed in 
the eAd. — Christian Register. 

BURNT COOKIES 

How many of our readers were trained 
as children under that economic regime 
which insisted that the specked apples 
should be eaten before the unimpaired 
ones and that the burnt cookies should 
come in order before the properly 
browned ones should be taken from the 
plate? 

This was a conuHon procedure in old 
New England, and the state of the par- 



tially decayed fruit and the bitter tang of 
the carbonized crust is not altogether 
pleasantly associated with grandmother's 
table, generous as it may have been on 
Thanksgiving Day. Sweet cider turned 
to vinegar because, from this same habit 
of economy, it seemed wasteful to eat or 
drink things up is, probably, also a sad 
memory of boyhood. 

This penurious asceticism arose from 
the commendable caretaking and saving 
spirit inculcated by generations of poor 
and pious people and inherited, perhaps, 
with a slight twist which made it ridicu- 
lous. If apples or any other fruit are a 
luxury, one can eat a less amount of 
them or even refrain entirely, as the ma- 
jority of us refrain from champagne. 
But if we are going to taste the delicious 
fruit or the crisp and exhilarating cookie, 
for Heaven's sake let us have the dimin- 
utive portion with flavor unspoiled, even 
though half the barrel decays and half of 
the baking is scorched. 

Another relic of those almost pre-his- 
toric days of economy is found in the 
habit that some mothers and possibly 
some fathers have of insisting that every- 
thing on a plate delivered over to the 
tender mercies of their offspring must be 
eaten up. Why should man or child eat 
more than he desires ? It is a foolish in- 
heritance, an offshoot of the primitive 
hospitality that would load the visitor's 
plate with food and feel offended, if the 
whole were not eaten. — TAe Herald 



The great man does not become great 
suddenly. Like Ernest, in Hawthorne's 
story of "The Great Stone Face," he 
moulds his features by high thinking and 
kindly acting. "Let us always remem- 
ber," writes Maurice Maeterlinck, "that 
nothing befalls us that is not of the na- 
ture of ourselves. There comes no ad- 
venture but wears to our soul the shape 
of everyday thoughts; and deeds of 
heroism are but offered to those who, for 
many long years, have been heroes in 
obscurity and silence,'^

Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 



IN all recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured aftei 
sifting once. Where flour is measured by cups, the cup is tilled with a spoon, and a 
level cupful is meant. A tablespoonful or teaspoonful of any designated material is a 
LEVEL spoonful. 



Celery Relish 

CUT tender heart-stalks of celery 
into pieces about two inches long. 
Let crisp in ice water to which a 
lemon rind or a tablespoonful of vinegar 
has been added. Pick the fillets from 
three anchovies, fine, with a silver fork 
(if put up in salt freshen in cold water), 
mix the anchovies with the sifted yolks 
and the chopped whites of two hard- 
cooked e^s; stir in enough mayonnaise 
dressii^ to hold the ingredients together. 
Wipe the celery dry and use as a recep- 
tacle for the mixture. Serve at the be- 
ginning of luncheon or dinner. 

Celery Relish No. 2 
Put heart-leaves of lettuce about three 
inches long on individual plates. Fill 
each leaf compactly with tiny slices of 
crisp celery and bits of anchovy (twice 
as much celery as anchovy) mixed with 
mayonnaise dressing. Cover completely 
with crosswise strips of fine- chopped 



parsley, sifted yolk and chopped white of 
a hard-cooked egg. Season the mayon; 
naise with a little onion juice and cay- 
enne. Spread the mixture lightly with 
mayonnaise before setting the strips of 
decoration in place. 

Oyster Cocktail Sauce, Septem- 
ber Style 

Chop a red and a green pepiier exceed- 
ingly fine; add to tonuto catsup with a 
scraping of new onion. The quantity of 
catsup used with the peppers will depend 
on individual taste. This sauce is good 
with lobster, scallops, or fresh tomatoes. 

Deviled Crackers 

To two teaspoonfuls of mustard add 
Worcestershire sauce to form a paste; 
stir this paste into three tablespoon fuls 
of butter beaten to a cream; add also 
half a teaspoonful of paprika or half that 
quantity of cayenne. Spread the mixture 
on thin crackers and set the crackers into 
the oven to become hot and colored

slightly. Serve hot with celery, cheese, 
olives or tomato soup. 

Chaudfroid of Poached Eggs 
Cook fresh-laid eggs by steaming them 
in round shallow cups or by poaching 
them directly in water just below the 
boiling point. For five eggs make a cup 
of chaudfroid sauce and a cup of aspic 
jelly. Cover the eggs, chilled and set on 
a plate or board, with the sauce, decorate 
with small figures cut from thin slices 
of truffle, then cover the whole with 
aspic just on the point of "setting." In 
the center of a serving dish set a lemon 
■cut in lengthwise eighths, and surround 
with the eggs and thick slices of tomato, 
cut in quarters and each holding a round- 



fourth a cup of cold water, stir until the 
gelatine is melted, then let cool and use 
as directed above. 

Aspic Jelly for Poached Eggs 
Soften one-fourth a package of gela- 
tine in one-fourth a cup of cold water, 
then dissolve in one cup of clarified and 
highly seasoned chicken broth. 

Tuna Salad 

Separate the cooked (canned) fish into 
large flakes or pieces ; dispose them on 
carefully washed and dried lettuce 
leaves ; pour over a pint or a can of fish, 
five tablespoonfuls of olive oil, two table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, half a teaspoonful 
of onion juice, half a teaspoonful of pap- 



CHAUDFROID OF POACHED EGGS 



ing teaspoonful of mayonnaise ; at equal 
intervals, near the edge, set choice olives 
(trim the stem end that they may stand 
level) and fill in with lettuce shredded 
in narrow ribbons. Serve as a first 
•course at luncheon or dinner. An egg, 
a piece of tomato, an olive, a little let- 
tuce and a section of lemon constitute 
one service. 

Chaudfroid Sauce 

Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter; in 
it cook two tablespoonfuls of flour, and 
one-fourth a teaspoonful. each, of salt 
and pepper ; add one cup of rich chicken 
broth, thin cream, rich milk or tomato 
puree; stir until boiling; add one-fourth 
3 package of gelatine softened in one- 



rika and a scant half teaspoonful of salt. 
beaten together until thick and creamy. 
At the center of the mound of fish set a 
tablespoonful of mayonnaise dressing; 
sprinkle the mayonnaise thick with 
pickled beets, chopped fine, also set a 
teaspoonful of the chopped beets, at in- 
tervals, entirely around the mound of 
fish. Capers may be used in place of the 
beets. 

Tuna Au Gratin in Shells 
Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter; in 
it cook two tablespoonfuls of flour and 
half a teaspoonful, each, of salt and pap- 
rika, then add one cup of chicken broth 
(seasoned with vegetables and sweet 
herbs), or of milk, and stir until boiling.

cup of melted butter. Set into the oven 
to become very hot and brown the 
crumbs. Set a sprig of parsley or a 
paper aigrette in the center of the mix- 
ture in each shell. 

Panned Chicken 
Clean and separate a young chicken 
into pieces at the joints. Put the chicken 
into a baking pan, add a cup of boiling 
water, cover close and let cook about an 
hour and a half. Baste each fifteen min- 
utes with melted butter and the liquid in 
the pan. Serve with a sauce made of 
the cooking liquid and cream, and with 
com fritters or Southern corn bread.

cooked beets, to make thin, neat-looking 
cups. For each cup chop fine two olives 
and half a stalk of tender celery (inner 
stalks), mix with French or mayonnaise 
dressing, seasoned with onion juice, and 
use to fill the cups. Roll a small flow-

A Blackberry Dessert and Its Many Variations 



By Jessamine Chapman 



DURING the berry season one 
may serve a different dessert 
each day, making berries the 
foundation, for there are innumerable 
ways of serving this fruit. As a basis 
for a long list of gelatine desserts a plain 
blackberry jelly can be made. 

The following recipes are made with 
three cups of liquid, or one and one half 
pints — serving six people. 

Blackberry Mold 

Soak two tablespoonfuls of granulated 
gelatine in one-half a cup of cold water. 
Add hot syrup made of one cup of sugar 
and one-half, a cup of water. Mash 
enough berries to make one and one half 
cups of juice; express juice and add to 
gelatine mixture. Add also one-half a 
cup of lemon juice, to add to the flavor 
of the jelly. Pour into molds, set in 
cold water, and chill until set. Serve, 
unmolded, with whipped cream. 

Blackberry Cubes 

Make a blackberry jelly as above, 
pouring a thin layer in a shallow square 
pan. Allow the mixture to partly set, 
then arrange very large and ripe black- 
berries in rows on the jelly. Pour over 
these the remaining jelly and let chill. 
Cut in cubes, each containing a whole 
berry. Serve, piled on a plate, and gar- 
nish with whipped cream put through the 
pastry bag. 



Blackberry Cocoanut Cubes 

Roll cubes of blackberry jelly, made as 
above, in shredded cocoanut, covering 
them thickly. Serve in a basket made of 
sponge cake from which the center has 
been removed. Serve with whipped 
cream. 

I. Blackberry Jelly Varied by 
Adding Eggs and Cream 

Blackberry Sponge 

To the whites of four eggs, beaten 
stiff, add the blackberry jelly which has 
been beaten light and thick with the 
Dover egg-beater. Mold. Serve with 
whipped cream or with custard made of 
the yolks of eggs and one pint of milk. 

Blackberry Marshmallows 

Mold Blackberry Sponge in a shallow 
tin. Cut in cubes, when set, and serve in 
a basket of cake, made as above. 

Blackberry Toasted Marsh- 
mallows 

Roll cubes in powdered macaroons or 
ground nuts. These look like real toasted 

marshmallows. 

Blackberry Spanish Cream 

Soak one tablespoonful of granulated 
gelatine in one-half a cup of cold black- 
berry juice; heat one and one-half cups 



132 



A BLACKBERRY DESSERT 



133 



of blackberry juice; add one cup of 
sugar and the soaked gelatine. Pour 
over four yolks of eggs, slightly beaten. 
Cook in double-boiler until thick like a 
custard, stirring constantly. Cool, add 
one-half a cup of lemon juice and fold 
in the whites of the eggs, beaten stiff. 
Turn into wet molds and let chill. 
Serve, unmolded; garnish with whipped 
cream and whole blackberries. 

Blackberry Bavarian Cream 

Heat one and one half cups of black- 
berry juice and pour over four egg yolks, 
slightly beaten, with one cup of sugar 
and one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt. 
Cook mixture in double-boiler until 
thickened. Remove from fire; add one 
tablespoonful of gelatine softened in one- 
fourth a cup of the cold fruit juice. 
When cold and beginning to set, whip 
with the Dover egg-beater and then fold 
in two cups of cream, whipped stiff. 
Turn in a mold and let chill. It should 
have a spongy texture. Do not use any 
of the cream that has drained through 
in whip. 

Blackberry Parfait 

Soak one tablespoonful of gelatine in 
one-half a cup of cold blackberry juice. 
Heat one and one half cups of juice with 
one cup of sugar to make a thick syrup ; 



add softened gelatine and pour on the 
whites of four eggs, beaten stiff. Con- 
tinue beating until the mixture is cool. 
Add one-half a cup of lemon juice and 
two cups of cream, beaten stiff. Pack 
mold in equal measures of ice and salt, 
and let stand four hours. Unmold and 
garnish with whole blackberries. 

II. Blackberry Jelly, Varied by 

Adding Cream 

Blackberry Charlotte 

Soak two tablespoonfuls of granulated 
gelatine in one-half a cup of blackberry 
juice. Add one-half a cup of hot juice, 
to which has been added one cup of 
sugar. Add one-fourth a cup of lemon 
juice, when cool, and one cup of black- 
berry juice. When the mixture begins 
to harden, beat until light ; add the whip 
from two cups of cream, and beat until 
stiff enough to drop. Mold. Serve with 
a garnish of whipped cream and whole 
berries. 

Blackberry Mousse 

Soak two tablespoonfuls of gelatine in 
one-half a cup of blackberry juice. Add 
a syrup made of one and one-half cups 
of blackberry juice and one cup of sugar. 
Beat until cool, then fold in two cups of 
cream, whipped stiff. Pour in mold,

seal well, and pack in equal measures of 
ice and salt. Let stand four hours. 

On examination of these various black- 
berry, gelatine recipes, it will be noticed 
that the proportions of ingredients are 
fairly constant for all, and that there are 
three distinct steps in the combining of 
ingredients : — first, softening the gelatine 
in cold juice; second, adding the hot juice 
to which sugar has been added; third, 
adding either beaten eggs or cream or 
both, when cooled. 

In the table, note that the amount of 
gelatine is decreased where a custard 



foundation using eggs is introduced. 

The sugar may be increased or dimin- 
ished according to taste and the charac- 
ter of the additional ingredients. 

Lemon juice is used in every recipe to 
bring out the flavor, but may be reduced 
in amount if desired. 

Salt is needed, especially in the recipes 
where cream is used. 

Only two recipes require packing in 
ice and salt to freeze; namely, the Par- 
fait and the Mousse. The others will 
chill sufficiently in the ice box, or sooner 
in pans of cracked ice. 



Keeping House in the Margins of the Day 

By Ruth Lincoln 



THESE days housekeepers the 
country over are learning the 
significance of the word "effi- 
ciency." They have discovered that it 
represents the same principle that their 
husbands have of late years applied to 
various lines of business with ever in- 
creasing profit. They are coming to 
see that the old fifteen-hour "day" for 
them can be cut down by "system" and 
that a tremendous amount of waste 
time and energy has been the definite 
cause of the long period of toil they 
have undergone. 

Now, if the wise utilization of every 
minute and every movement counts 
with the woman whose sole business it 
is to run a house, it certainly means 
more to one who is forced to do her 
house work in the edges of the day, as 
are so many twentieth century women of 
business. Every year more and more 
of them are saying farewell to board- 
ing houses and setting up their own 
establishments. 

When I first went to housekeeping 
in a four-room apartment with a girl 
partner a year ago, everybody, includ- 
ing ourselves, regarded it as a rash ex- 
periment. We were both employed all 



day and must leave the house at 8:30 
in the morning not to return until 
nearly 6 at night. Our plan was to 
cook and serve two meals daily and 
keep the house clean and orderly. 

"There arfe so many things that use 
up your time that you don't realize 
until you get into it," a married friend 
warned us. "I don't see how you can 
ever manage when you are tired out 
at night." 

Such discouragement deterred us 
from a heavy investment in furniture, 
as we did not know how long we could 
keep it up, and right here we learned 
one of the great lessons of labor sav- 
ing, viz : to have as little furniture and 
as plain furniture as possible. Every 
additional piece, we realized to our 
sorrow, meant additional care and ad- 
ditional dusting and sweeping. We 
carefully avoided any carved surfaces, 
and placed on the floor only rugs small 
enough to be easily shaken. Our hall 
runner was of grass carpeting. 

We decided to divide the night labor 
by taking turns alternate weeks. This 
gave one of us seven evenings entirely 
free out of fourteen and proved a very 
satisfactory arrangement. In the morn- 



KEEPING HOUSE IN MARGINS OF DAY

ings we worked together. 

To revert to cleaning, which is ac- 
ceded to be the hardest part of house- 
keeping. Counting the hall and bath 
we had six rooms, one of which we as- 
signed to each week-day. In the morn- 
ing of that day one room was cleaned, 
mopped and dusted with chemical 
mops. The whole operation seldom 
took over twenty minutes of hustling, 
for we provided ourselves with every 
device we could find in the department 
stores for making the labor lighter. 
We had mops to go under the bath 
tub and radiators, mops with short 
handles for sinks and tubs^ dustless 
dustcloths, etc. The other rooms had 
a daily "lick and a promise," and, as we 
were out of them all day, this kept 
down dust and preserved order, and we 
were left without the fatigue of thor- 
oughly cleaning the house once a 
week. 

In the mornings we stripped our 
couch beds and left them airing, to 
shock family traditions. 

As time went on we learned many 
things of value about the preparation 
of our meals. Our menus we prepared 
for seven days on Saturday nights and 
stuck to them religiously. Saturday 
night we also bought a week's supply 
of groceries. We could have saved 
money by buying in larger quantities, 
but we had so little kitchen space that 
it did not seem advisable. This left us 
to purchase daily only meat and fruit. 
Our milk came each morning. As we 
made these purchases on our way 
home from work, it did not seem to be 
a burden. 

Around the kitchen range we 
screwed hooks within easy reach and 
there hung everything we used about 
the stove, toaster, frying pan, egg 
poacher, agate kettles, etc. The dif- 
ference between having them there and 
nicely stowed away on a remote shelf 
was a revelation to us. 

We kept a small dressmakers' fold- 
ing table in the* kitchen, over which we 



placed a spotless cover and ate our 
breakfasts there, where we could actu- 
ally reach everything necessary from our 
seats. We also had in the kitchen a 
high stool upon which we could perch 
when washing dishes, paring potatoes, 
or any similar task For our dinners 
we were forced to broil most of our 
meats, but Saturday nights and Sun- 
days we had a roast. 'We always had 
a vegetable and salad besides potatoes, 
and the work of preparing dinner and 
clearing it away we kept down to an 
hour. We made many a cake or pud- 
ding or other desert in the evenings 
and we bought nothing from the bak- 
ery except bread. We have certainly 
grown fat and vigorous on this diet. 

We had house dresses and big all- 
over aprons into which we could shift 
easily. 

We kept accounts strictly and facil- 
itated this by keeping a big calendar, 
with generous white spaces about the 
figures, hung close beside the dumb 
waiter up which our purchases always 
came. From this a pencil was strung 
and we made the entry at once, later 
transferring to the account book. We 
also kept a pad and pencil tied to the 
laundry bag and entered each soiled 
article as soon as it was cast aside, 
thus making our list complete as we 
went along. 

We had a card catalogue of recipes 
which we collected from various 
sources. It was easier for us to type- 
write them than to copy in the old- 
fashioned way and proved much more 
convenient to use. 

We set apart one night each week 
to be "at home" to callers, besides Sun- 
day afternoons, when we kept open 
house. 

We kept constantly in mind the 
thought of making no false movements 
and the necessity of losing no time. 
We have tried to avoid all hunting by 
having a fixed place for everything. 

It seems to us that the whole secret 
lies in having the furnishings as simple

aged to try the experiment. 



College G>oking 



When Helen left her classic Cicero, 
And stopped her Greek and Logic for 
awhile. 
To wield the rolling-pin and knead the 
dough, 
The Profs indulged in a sarcastic smile. 
We thought it just a fad, 
A fancy that she had, 
We thought her only playing with a brand 
new cookery book. 
But the cook book's worn and frayed, 
And our valiant little maid 
Is heroically proving that the College girl 
can cook. 

When Daisy donned an apron, frilled and 
neat. 
With a dainty cap upon her curly head, 
'*She likes cooking 'cause the outfit looks 
so sweet, 
'Twill tire her soon," triumphantly we 
said. 
But she stuck to it like glue, 
Resolved to see it through, 
Her orders like a soldier obediently she 
took; 
With fingers cut and burnt. 
New recipes she learnt, 
Till we cannot help admitting that the Col- 
lege girl can cook. 



We joked about her heavy soggy cake. 
And her biscuit that were like a cannon- 
ball; 
We said that the Pure Food law ought to 
make 
Her put a label "Danger" on them all. 
But she let us have our laugh, 
Calmly overlooked our chaff, 
And her culinary labors not for one hour 
forsook. 
But she nobly cooked away. 
And we eat her cake today 
As we grudgingly acknowledge that the 
College girl can cook. 

Now when a young man's looking for a 
wife, he doesn't try 
To choose her for the Latin in her head. 
Not, "Can she work quadratics?" but "Can 
she make a pie?" 
He asks; "And is it safe to eat her 
bread?" 
So, though Latin's useful, yet. 
Education, don't forget. 
Doesn't all depend on what you get from 
lecture-rooms and books; 
But it's cooking counts today. 
And a College course will pay 
All honor to the vindicated Co-ed Cooks!

Science and Food 



Dr. Carl L. Alsberg 

Chief of the Bureau of Chembir^, Department of Agriculture 



ONE of the great needs of the times 
is more science in the manufac- 
ture of foods. Here in the 
United States the business of food man- 
ufacture has advanced with extraordi- 
nary rapidity. We no longer "live at 
home," as they say in the South. Our 
table is dependent on the distant grower, 
the distant manufacturer. The food 
problem is not a problem of the home or 
even of the locality. It is a problem, 
nation wide. It has, therefore, become 
necessary for the Department of Agricul- 
ture to broaden its scope, to consider not 
only the production of raw materials, but 
also the production of manufactured 
food products. It has become the func- 
tion of the Department to regulate and 
aid in the development of food manu- 
facture so that the products of our fac- 
tories shall be prepared under the best 
scientific and economic conditions. 
Much has been done already. Much re- 
mains to be done. But we hope the day 
is not far distant when American manu- 
factured foodstuffs will be recognized as 
representing the highest standard. 

When food was manufactured only 
for the home or, at most, for local con- 
sumption, the experience handed down 
by tradition was sufficient. A mill to 
grind grain, a smoke house to cure 
meats, brine to pickle them, a cool cellar 
to store vegetables, tubers, eggs, butter, 
and cheese, these were all that were 
deemed necessary. What could not be 
preserved by these simple methods was 
wasted and during the long winter 
months fresh food was somewhat of a 
luxury. Our cities were small, and their 
food supply came mainly from the imme- 
diate neighborhood. The monotony of 
the diet often produced scurvy and re- 
lated diseases, and the failure of local 
crops, coupled with limited transporta- 



tion facilities, caused occasional famines. 
These were the good old days. 

The concentration of population in 
towns and the development of transpor- 
tation have resulted in a complete trans- 
formation of the food manufacturing in- 
dustry. Food must now be brought from 
great distances, and, in order to do this 
economically, it is necessary to operate 
on a great scale. Food can be handled 
in train-load lots or in ship cargoes only 
by large business organization. The in- 
dividual farmer can not ship successfully 
over great distances. 

It is natural for a business that is 
shipping on a large scale also to develop 
into a manufacturing industry. Indeed, 
in some instances, such as the beet sugar 
industry, manufacturing may develop an 
entirely new agricultural crop. 

The result of the large scale develop- 
ment has been to lessen waste. It is less 
wasteful to slaughter a steer in a pack- 
ing house and utilize all by-products, 
than to slaughter on the farm and lose 
a great part of them. If the people as 
a whole do not seem to profit thereby as 
much as they might, it is not because or- 
ganization does not conserve wealth, but 
because the wealth thus conserved is not 
widely distributed. 

These changes in the condition of the 
food industry that I have indicated make 
it necessary for the Department of Agri- 
culture to broaden its scope. Its duties 
no longer end when it has shown how 
two blades of grass may be made to grow 
where but one g^ew before. It must 
recognize the fact that the food industry 
is no longer entirely a home industry. It 
must recognize the fact that the manu- 
facture of food is being transferred from 
the home to the factory, as surely as the 
spinning of flax and the weaving of cloth 
has been transferred from the home to 



137 



138 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



the factory. The city woman who bakes 
her own bread is exceptional. Some- 
thing is gained and something is lost. 
Though some may think the gain not 
equal to the loss, the change is upon us 
and must be met. It will not do to fold 
our hands and lament the good old days. 
They are past, never to return. We must 
be up and doing to meet the new. The 
Department of Agriculture must and 
does recognize that most food passes 
through a factory, on its way from the 
farm to the home. Let us be thankful 
that it is to the home that it mainly 
passes and not the restaurant; and that 
home cooking is not yet altogether a lost 
art. As, yet, the rich do not live entirely 
at restaurants and the poor entirely out 
of cans. I suppose you gentlemen are 
directly interested in getting as many 
people as possible to live out of cans. 
With this purpose the Department of 
Agriculture has no quarrel. It is simply 
the duty of the Department to see that 
the can is worthy of the consumer. 

That Congress is fully awake to the 
changes of the times appears clearly 
from the fact that it has entrusted to the 
Department of Agriculture the control 
of the purity and the labeling of food- 
stuflFs. Upon the Bureau of Chemistry 
naturally devolves the control of food- 
stuffs in the factory, on their way from 
farm to home. The control of manufac- 
turing methods is a very large part of its 
work. It is that part of its work in 
which you gentlemen are interested. 
Here is a valuable and insufficiently de- 
veloped field of work for a government 
department. 

The whole transformation of the food 
industry has been so rapid that abuses 
could not fail to creep into it. The old 
household methods are often bad when 
applied on a large scale. New methods 
had to be devised. Under the pressure 
of competition, these have not always 
been thoroughly tested. Thus trade prac- 
tices have become established that are 
very hard to eradicate. It must be one 
of the duties of the Department of Ag- 



riculture to examine into all these pro- 
cesses, to improve the good ones, and 
discover substitutes for the bad. It must 
also be its function to develop methods 
of utilizing by-products and of using as 
food many things which are not now 
utilized. 

I fear the average layman does not 
fully grasp the economic possibilities of 
chemistry in its relation to agriculture 
and the food supply. Everyone is willing 
to grant its importance to metallurgy, to 
ceramics, to the paint, varnish and dye- 
stuffs industry. The layman is apt to 
dispose of chemistry in relation to foods 
with some joke about artificial food and 
the millenium when man shall live on a 
few concentrated artificial pills. While 
there is no prospect that we shall give up 
the joys of the table for a supply of cap- 
sules carried in our vest pockets, never- 
theless chemistry, as in the past, will 
increasingly in the future influence di- 
rectly and indirectly our food supply. I 
need only refer to the production of 
sugar, of starch, of fertilizers and the 
utilization of agricultural by-products 
and wastes, to indicate how dependent 
our modern food production is on the 
application of chemistry. Much more is 
to be expected in the future along these 
lines, and the Department of Agriculture 
hopes to do its share. 

Much, too, is demanded of chemistry 
in finding new and improved processes 
for manufacturing the raw product of 
the farm into products for the table. 
Were I to sketch but a part of the pos- 
sibilities that here present themselves to 
any chemist that has given the matter 
any thought, I would soon weary you. 
However, I think I have said enough to 
indicate to you some of the lines along 
which the Bureau of Chemistry is to be 
developed. It is hoped to make the Bu- 
reau of Chemistry as useful to the con- 
sumer, by advancing the manufacture of 
foods, as the Department of Agriculture, 
as a whole, has been useful to the farmer. 
This IS, to be sure, no new thought. 
Much work of this type has always been 




DE-NATURED ALCOhOL 



139 



done in the Department of Agriculture, 
but it is hoped to make this work the 
dominant note of the Bureau's policy. 

Some there may be who will say : Why 
not let the manufacturer look out for 

m 

himself, why should the people's good 
money be used to help him? One answer 
is that what helps one class of the com- 
munity helps all. But there are other 
and even better reasons. The work I 
have outlined is costly and difficult. Only 
the larger and richer manufacturing con- 
cerns can stand the expense and take the 
risk of experimenting. When they suc- 
ceed, the new process is either kept se- 
cret or patented. The result is to destroy 
the small manufacturer and reduce com- 
petition. When the government carries 
out these investigations the results are 
free for all to use. 

Modern conditions are concentrating 
the manufacture of food into fewer and 
fewer hands. Many causes have been 



at work. Not the least of them has been 
pure-food legislation. This bears very 
much harder on the small man than on 
the big corporation, which can better 
afford to establish laboratories and em- 
ploy experts. Those of you who are fa- 
miliar with the situation will, I feel con- 
fident, agree with me that this is a fact. 
For this there can be no complete rem- 
edy. It is the trend of the times. No one 
wants to go back to the old days before 
the enactment of these laws. There has 
been and will be no laxity, no step back- 
ward in the administration of the law, 
but the administration of the law will 
gain in effectiveness, if it be coupled with 
a policy of education and instruction. It 
will be the ideal of the Department of 
Agriculture both to prevent violation of 
the law and to help those who wish to 
obey it. I am here today to enlist your 
support. — From Address to Association 
of Grocers. 



De-Natured Alcohol 

7%e Hoasewtfe's Frknd 

By Alice Margaret Ashton 



HUNDREDS of women in our 
smaller towns and rural dis- 
tricts ►» have been privileged 
merely to read and to dream of the man- 
ifold appliances made possible through 
the use of electricity and gas. To the 
aid of these hitherto restricted house- 
wives comes the new fuel, de-natured 
alcohol. 

Both gasoline and kerosene have, in 
some measure, filled the need of the 
more satisfactory fuels, but alcohol in 
this application comes much nearer gas 
than do either. Alcohol is clean and 
pleasant to handle, leaving neither smoke 
nor stain on utensils used over its flame. 
It burns without an odor, and is excep- 
tionally safe to use, there being little or 
no possibility of danger from explosion. 



If it is accidentally spilled, it evaporates 
immediately, without leaving mark or 
stain to tell the tale. And when it can 
be purchased in the neighborhood of 
fifty cents per gallon, it is not an ex- 
pensive fuel, if managed with the same 
care expended in the use of electricity or 
gas. 

For all practical purposes, heat is not 
obtained by a direct burning of the alco- 
hol, but by means of a burner that 
converts the alcohol to a gas which burns 
with a blue, wickless flame. The heat is 
quick and effective. 

The alcohol stove has passed through 
the experimental stage and proven its 
right to exist. Its usual form resembles 
a gas plate of one, two or three burners, 
raised upon short legs, with the storage 



140 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



tank at the back; the tank is not large 
as the fuel is consumed slowly. It is 
quite attractive enough to be used in 
place of the chafing dish, as the legs are 
of nickel, and the tank, aluminum. This 
little stove weighs only a few pounds, 
and is easily carried wherever desired. 
It can be purchased for about eight dol- 
lars. 

With the alcohol stove before her on 
the dining or serving table, the hostess 
can prepare a dainty supper, or make 
coffee and cook eggs for breakfast, as 
daintily and comfortably as with the 
most approved electrical appliance. Nor 
is it less practical in thje kitchen. The 
heat can be regulated, from a flame in- 
tense enough for the quick cooking of a 
steak, to a "simmering" heat for slow 
cooking. 

A new standard of housekeeping 
should accompany any of the newer 
fuels ; they all prove expensive and even 
unsatisfactory when used after the man- 
ner of the coal range. To get the best 
results when using a frying-pan over the 
alcohol stove, it is advisable to place a 
piece of heavy tin under the pan to dis- 
tribute the heat, otherwise the heat is 
too great directly over the burner and 
correspondingly insufficient round the 
edges. 

As is the case when using gas or elec- 
tricity, slow prolonged cooking over the 
alcohol stove is somewhat expensive. 
There are, however, two exceedingly 
satisfactory ways of overcoming this 
difficulty ; the fireless cooker which com- 
pletes, without the use of fuel, the cook- 
ing begun on the stove, is one of them, 
the steam cooker in which a complete 
dinner may be prepared over one burner, 
the other. 

The neat little stove will do a surpris- 
ing amount of work when sensibly man- 
aged, and only the woman who has been 
obliged to work over a hot range in sum- 



mer can fully appreciate the comfort of 
a cool kitchen. 

Among the practical appliances, the 
flat-iron heated by means of alcohol 
holds a high place. The heat can be 
regulated as desired. It bums for sev- 
eral hours without attention. Such an 
iron saves many steps to and from the 
stove in the process of but one ironing, 
and allows of the ironing being done 
wherever fancy dictates. The iron costs 
in the neighborhood of five dollars. 

The table coffee percolator, while not 
of such extreme practicality as the first 
named articles, is a convenience, espe- 
cially in the family where coffee forms 
the foundation for breakfast. 

The chafing dish is rapidly filling a 
long-felt social need with the hostess 
who has been obliged to depend alone 
upon her kitchen range for cooking. It 
is deserving of more common use, for 
nothing can exceed its cosy comfort at 
the family supper table. Many creamed 
and escalloped dishes, which for reasons 
of haste or convenience are prepared in 
the kitchen, are much improved when 
served from the chafing dish; have the 
hot water pan liberally supplied, and the 
second helping of the dish will be as 
palatable as the first. 

Other conveniences are continually 
making their appearance. The alcohol 
lamp, requiring neither wick nor chim- 
ney, and in consequence but a minimum 
of care, a small, portable heater, a self- 
heating curling iron, and a heated man- 
gle for ironing flat pieces, are in quite 
common use. 

This means, although some of the ap- 
pliances are still in the experimental 
stage, a new era in the housekeeping of 
a multitude of homes situated outside 
the big commercial centers. The new 
fuel is being welcomed by many house- 
wives who see, through it, th*^^^ dreams 
materializing. 



Harmony in Home Siuroundings 



By Florence Lilian Bush 



IF more of us understood the under- 
lying laws of the science of color, 
instead of feeling them very dimly, 
our depressing Northern rooms would be 
furnished in the warm tints of Autumn. 
The paper would be of that unobtrusive 
yellow, the color of poplar trees just be- 
fore they drop their leafage, while the 
rugs would get their tones from the rich- 
hued maples. Possibly a brass candle- 
stick or a copper bowl would give an 
added note of brightness, while a piece 
of dull blue pottery would be just the 
right touch of complementary color 
needed for a pleasing contrast. White 
wood work would atone for the depress- 
ing lack of sunshine and the furnishings 
give the warmth of color desired. 

Just as our Northern rooms are "toned 
up," so our Southern rooms might be 
"toned down," to take off all the glare 
which is apt to disturb the eye. Cool 
blues and restful greens are appropriate, 
while delicately-tinted walls make an at- 
tractive background for water color 
sketches such as lilacs, fleur de lis, and 
hazy, spring landscapes. The prevailing 
tones in the pictures should harmonize 
with those in the rooms, but a touch of 
violet as a foil for yellow, red to empha- 
size dull green, and orange against blue, 
strikes the key note of effective contrast. 
What the French dressmaker has 
brought out by the use of a ribbon or a 
ros^, we may well copy in our house- 
furnishing. 

y\ quiet background for a few well- 
chpsen pictures, which should be hung 
from the eye level down instead of up, 
as did our ancestors; landscapes in 
groups, portraits in groups, marines in 
groups with careful attention to variety 
in size and shape, insure pleasing results. 
Once desirable wall-spacing is accom- 
plished, no one is ever willing to go back 
to the hodge-podge effects of the past, 



when the man of the house was called 
on to drive a nail in the most vulnerable 
portion of the wall — ^generally high above 
our heads — from which the enlarged 
photograph of some ancestor was sus- 
pended. For years Great Uncle William 
gazed down at us from a broad expanse 
of white wall, and then the wonder 
worker with sacrilegious touch removed 
him, brushed the cobwebs from his back, 
and in his place grouped a few clear-cut 
etchings so near we seemed to be actu- 
ally walking the wooded path, or floating 
in the little boat, or driving the cattle 
homeward at sunset. 

Drifting away from the simplicity of 
the substantial log house with its wide 
fireplace and rag rugs, its wholesome life 
of work and play, the woman of mod- 
erate means has bought gaudy carpets 
and hangings, used cheap and ornate 
furniture, brilliant wall-paper, and 
brought a dozen conflicting shades into 
close proximity, but to-day she knows 
better. 

Her kitchen, instead of being a gloomy, 
inconvenient room with dull wall-paper, 
an ugly or decrepit chair, cupboards 
painted gray — ^that there may be no visi- 
ble evidences of dirt — cooking utensils 
of all ages and colors in evidence, has 
given place to light and cheerfulness. 
Inexpensive wall-paper may be harmo- 
nious in coloring and can be replaced at 
little cost. A stool for sitting at the 
ironing or moulding-board, an easy chair 
in which to sit while paring vegetables 
or polishing the silver, cooking utensils 
of beautiful blue and white granite, or 
aluminum with its cheerful, silvery 
sheen, cupboards painted white and crisp, 
white curtains at the windows, all of 
these help to transform the drudgery of 
home life into tasks set to joyful melo- 
dies. Even the calendar on the wall adds 
or detracts from the harmony of the

room. 

Today really artistic rag rugs are be- 
ing woven in obscure towns, and it only 
remains for patrons, in sufficient number, 
to encourage these harmonious products 
of the loom. Last summer, in a small, 
Northern village, we noticed a well-built, 
modern home on a conspicuous rise of 
ground. Below, and at one side, stood a 
little, old house seemingly a forsaken, 
outworn nest which, evidently, the family 
had not the heart to destroy. As we 
passed it one morning, a white-haired 
woman stood in the door-way and we 
turned up the wild-rose bordered path. 

Near the door stood a loom, and pres- 
ently we were being shown a variety of 
rugs and porch pillows which would have 
delighted any disciple of simplicity. We 
looked up into the face ot the plain, old 
weaver who had fashioned these articles 
of furnishing, blending with rare skill 
shades and tints until the old-fashioned, 
much despised rag rug of our grand- 
mothers was glorified into a thing of 
beauty. We examined the rugs she had 
woven for a neighbor's new home — white 
with delicate blue borders, blue and 
white fringed; a mottled cream and 
white with a band of pale green, and 
white fringe. There were many others, 
some showing real Oriental contrast of 
color, while one was of browns with a 
touch of orange. We had never seen 
anything more effective. Visions of cool, 
restful chambers rose before our eyes, 
where great thoughts might be penned 
without the distraction of a discordant 
note. 

"Yes, I make my own patterns," the 
weaver assured us, bringing us back to 
the present. "I live with my son up 
there," indicating the modem house on 
the hill. "But I do my planning down 
here in my old home. This is where I 
began housekeeping. I wove carpeting 
enough to cover every floor. It puts me 
back fifty years to come here and work. 
I weave all my memories of the past in- 



to these rugs and porch pillows. I al- 
ways sit in that chair — it was one of my 
wedding presents — " indicating an old, 
spindle-backed rocker. "I seem to see 
Morrie and Jamie running around in 
short dresses. 

We looked around at the plain, little 
rooms and the beautiful old chair which 
evoked such satisfying memories. Thank 
Heaven, it is only one of many which 
are being brought out of cobwebby attics 
and storehouses to grace our living- 
rooms, pointed out by prideful hostesses 
as "the chair my great, great grand- 
mother had when she set up housekeep- 
ing." No more do we hide the old loom 
or the bit of willow ware, be it ever so 
cracked. The beautiful, simple things of 
the past are emerging from their long 
retirement to find honored places in 
houses full of modem conveniences. 
How well they seem to fit into their new 
surroundings! What dignity and har- 
mony they lend to the spacious rooms, 
and how they gradually banish — just by 
their silent influence — ^those articles 
which are superfluous and incongruous. 

We weed out a multitude of insignifi- 
cant trifles, distracting to the eye, for 
one really valuable antique, which har- 
monizes only with things of its own kind. 
Our "Grandfather's clock" replaces the 
noisy onyx and gold affair or the ma- 
chine carved monstrosity of yesterday. 

Our grandmother's fine blue and white 
coverlets make beautiful portieres, and 
the large rooms are no longer full of 
dreary, unbroken spaces, but have cen- 
ters of interest-^the broad, old-fashioned 
fireplace is surrounded by comfortable 
seats, the couch near shelves of books 
has a screen conveniently near, the writ- 
ing desk with its beautiful lamp is near 
some cozy comer. Out in the hall or 
reception room we see, instead of the 
portraits of our ancestors, a picture 
which instantly attracts our attention by 
its well-arranged masses of light and 
dark.

How To Clean Fish Dishes 

THE. brave little lady who inaugu- 
rated the egg crusade last winter 
in Philadelphia, thereby bringing down 
the cost of eggs, at once, and holding them 
there the entire winter by sales at public 
squares and in homes, is a careful house- 
keeper and mother; and from her is ob- 
tained the following useful hint about 
overcoming the smell and taste of fish. 

Chatting about the difficulty of clean- 
ing utensils used for frying and baking 
fish, and keeping silver absolutely free 
of it with little effort, she remarked that 
hot water with plenty of mustard would 
speedily purify all such pans and kettles 
and silver. Ground mustard is not ex- 
pensive and the fact that mustard added 
to boiling water will do the work is 
worth knowing, since many object to 
patent cleansers. 

Mustard is, also, 3 good remedy for 
worms in the earth of house-plants. To 
burn off baking-pan over a hot fire is 
one remedy for the fishy taste, after 
washing it with strong soda water. 

Good Luck Baskets 

"Good Luck Baskets" are the newest 
favors and table decoration. As it is 
now the time of year when people are 
departing for summer trips, these are a 
happy thought, but a four-leafed clover 
is always welcome.* And these are what 
fill the good-luck baskets. 

The baskets are of a high, pretty shape, 
with high handle tied with a scarlet rib- 
bon, on which in gold lettering are the 



words "Brings Good Luck." To a far- 
mer a dollar and a half a bunch would 
be a good price for clover ! 

A Cold Air Box for Fish or Meat 

Sometimes at the shore fresh fish are 
brought home or bought and there is 
really no place to put them, indoors, or 
in the refrigerator. To keep such in the 
air and away from flies, cover a peach 
crate, made of slats, with remnants of 
mosquito netting, and under this (set in 
a good current of air) place the fish or 
meat. In parts of the South and the 
plains of the West, meat can be kept well, 
because the air is so pure and free from 
germs. The jerked meat of the plains, 
in buffalo days, was simply dried meat. 
At some old Alabama plantations, there 
are wire-screened boxes built against a 
big old tree trunk by the kitchen door, 
perhaps a great magnolia, green the year 
around. Under its branches is shade 
from the sun, and the cool sweet air 
keeps meat well, and other food, during 
much of the \'e?.r. 

At the shore, such a box can be placed 
across the kitchen porch-rail and weight- 
ed down so it will not blow off. 

Where no ice can be had, salt the fish 
and pepper it well after it is dressed; 
open the fish flat and do this thoroughly, 
and lay it on a drainer or rack, such as 
meat is cooked on, and place this over a 
platter, in the air. 

Fifteen Kinds of Fancy Pepper-

ing, as is evidenced by the placing on 
sale at fashionable shops a pretty white 
box, divided into five rows holding three 
compartments, each filled with a different 
kind of mint confection. The colors 
range, from white to green and pale pink, 
except for one dark variety the color of 
liquorice. 

Each kind is of a different shape, con- 
sistency or color, little cushions, egg- 
shaped, bright, green ones, large flat ones, 
partly white, shading to rose, transparent 
creme de menthe of gelatine foundation 
in bars, and so on. This is a very at- 
tractive novelty for any person liking 
mints, especially an invalid or an aged 
person. j. d. c.

Por Luncheon 

AN appetizing dish for luncheon may 
be quickly prepared thus : — 

Try the fat slowly from four slices of 
bacon; reject the bacon; brown deli- 
cately in the fat one small thinly sliced 
onion, then one gill of cold boiled rice; 
now add three well-beaten eggs mixed 
with three tablespoon fuls of cold water; 
pepper and salt to taste ; cook slowly ; as 
it sets, raise the preparation from the 
sides of the pan and let the soft part run 
under; sprinkle over it one gill of fine- 
minced ham, tongue, or chicken; fold it 
over gently ; send to table hot, on a warm 
platter, garnished with sprigs of parsley. 

Grated cheese is nice in place of meat. 

Two Desserts from One 
Pineapple 

Get a nice large pineapple ; cut off the 
top; wash and wash it thoroughly to 
take off every particle of dust; dry it; 
pare, and remove eyes; grate it very 
coarse, add sugar, mix and put it in a 
glass bowl ; set the bowl on ice to chill ; 
serve ice-cold with sponge cake or lady 
fingers. 

Put parings, eyes and core in an agate 
pan, cover with one and a half pints of 
cold water and allow to stand for two 
hours or more; bring slowly to boiling 



point, then simmer for fifteen minutes; 
strain and measure the liquid; to one 
pint use the strained juice of one 
lemon, a scant half pint of granulated 
sugar, a pinch of salt, and one table- 
spoonful of granulated gelatine, dis- 
solved in two tablespoonfuls of cold 
water; the pineapple must be returned 
to the fire so it will boil up once, 
then add the dissolved gelatine; do not 
cook it after the gelatine goes in, but stir 
until it is dissolved; add the sugar and 
lemon juice, also; cool, then put in the 
refrigerator until set; now beat the mix- 
ture until light and frothy; serve very 
cold with a little of the pineapple on each 
saucer, plain or whipped cream, or a thin 
custard. This dessert is refreshing after 
a heavy dinner, and especially nice with 
lady fingers on a warm day. l. n.

Shifting the Silence Cloth 

THE felt silence-cloth that is used 
under the linen table-cloth should 
be shifted occasionally, an inch or two, 
from side to side and from end to end, 
else it will be found to be getting a thin 
place along the line where the arms of 
those at table rest on or rub against the 
table edge. 

Scrap-Drawer 

I keep the lower, left-hand drawer of 
my sewing-machine half-way open, when 
the machine is in use, and every snipping 
from the fabric, every basting too short 
for further use, and every particle of 
thread or anything else that would other- 
wise "clutter" the sewing-room goes into 
this drawer and later into the fire; so 
there is no sweeping up to be done when 
the day's sewing is through with, because 
there is nothing to sweep. 

A Pencil-Holder for Everybody 

My husband wants me to write you 
about his "patent" pencil-holder. It is 
simply a rubber band such as you keep 
in your desk or the children get from 
around packages of chewing-gum.

Cooking Cauliflower 

MANY object to cooking cabbage or 
cauliflower on account of the un- 
pleasant smell it makes in the house. 
This can be avoided by dropping a 
couple of English walnuts (whole) in 
the kettle while cooking. Afterwards 
crack the nuts, and you will find where 
the odor went. n. g.

Traveling Lists 

1TAKE several trips every year, 
usually going for several weeks dur- 
ing the summer to a camp many miles 
from home among the Canadian lakes, 
and, also, making visits to relatives in 
other cities and, sometimes, take a sight- 
seeing trip of a week or two. 

When I go to the summer camp I must 
take with me everything I could possibly 
need to use as there is no opportunity to 
buy anything, and an article must be or- 
dered and delivered by boat after an in- 
terval of two or three days. 

Some years ago I made out lists in a 
memorandum book, which have been 
proved to be very convenient. I have 
one for my small handbag, one for my 
suit-case and one for my trunk. Each 
one contains the names of the articles I 
need to have with me in that receptacle. 
I consult these lists, as I pack, and I 
select and take with me the articles I 
will need on this special trip., 

Clothes, of course, vary from year to 
year and one is not apt to forget these, 
but there are dozens of small belongings 
essential to comfort, like pins, button- 
hook, tooth-brush, shoe-laces, and hot- 
water bag, which may be left behind and 
cannot be purchased without trouble and 

delay. 
Thanks to the invaluable little lists, I 



never have any worry about packing and, 
for five years, have never left any needed 
article at home. 

Covering Mattresses and Pillows 

1 COVER mattresses, bolsters and pil- 
lows with white muslin covers, which 
are ripped off and washed twice a year. 

After the pillows have been thoroughly 
sunned and aired, the clean covers are 
quickly and easily sewed on again. 

This method keeps the .ticking clean 
and saves the expense of renewing it 
frequently as otherwise would have to 
be done. The appearance of the bolster 
and pillows is much improved as the 
muslin covers keep them in shape and 
prevent the stripes of the ticking from 
showing through the cases. l. m. c.

For the Wood Fire 

WHILE visiting a friend in the coun- 
try we were charmed by her habit 
of bringing a little brown basket of pine 
cones each evening, which we burned on 
the open wood fire. They emitted a de- 
lightful, woodsy fragrance. One of the 
things to which she and the children look 
forward each fall is the gathering of 
these cones pn crisp Saturday afternoons. 
An old guide on a camping trip in the 
woods gave her the idea by always add- 
ing a pile of pine cones to the supply of 
evening fuel. 

Kitchen Work-Basket 

By a pleasant window in my kitcheii 
I keep a low, comfortable rocking chair 
and a work-basket. In this basket goes 
any sewing that requires no machine 
work, such as stockings and button- 
missing garments from the wash, and 
unfinished garments needing buttons and 
buttonholes and the last few stitches. 
While waiting a few minutes for meals 
or for some cooking" to finish, I can do 
many stitches without taking an extra 
step. Here, too, I rest for a few min- 
utes when I begin feeling tired. Too 
many busy women think they must never

sit down until the work is completed. 
My kitchen work-basket is one of my 
greatest helps. 

Birds for the Children 

Get the children interested in birds by 
letting them put up attractions for the 
little people of the feathered folk. In 
spring, put up some drinking fountain, 
if it is nothing more than shallow tin 
basins on stakes or low branches. If 
these are filled every morning, it is a 
charming sight to watch the birds collect 
for their morning toilet. They are apt 
to nest, also, near such attractions. In 
winter, let the little ones scatter the 
crumbs left from table on the window 
sills. A piece of tallow nailed to a 
branch will have almost constant visitors. 

A little shut-in will find this study very 
absorbing, and so will, for that matter, 
an older one. a. m. a. 



PERMIT me to send a receipt for a 
fruit salad with dressing made with- 
out mustard or oil. Answer to Query 
No. 1991. 



Salad 



i doz. oranges 
2 pineapples 
i lb. walnuts 
1 bottle cherries 



Dressing 

4 eggs beaten 
4 tablespoons vine- 
gar or lemon juice 
4 tablespoons sugar 
2 tablespoons water 

Cook until thick, remove from fire, stir 
in a good piece of butter. When ready 
to mix with fruit, add 1 pint of whipped 
cream. e. r. 



Sour Cream Salad Dressing 

ONE cup of sour cream, two eggs or 
three yolks, one to two tablespoon- 
fuls of vinegar according to acidity 
(plain or Tarragon), one level teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
white pepper or paprika. If liked, mus- 
tard to taste. 

Beat eggs, add cream, seasonings and 
vinegar. Stir all together well and cook 



slowly, stirring all the time till it thick- 
ens. If cooked too long or too rapidly 
the dressing will curdle. 

This is a good dressing for cabbage, 
making it a little more acid. 

Peanut Butter 

Roast one pound of raw peanuts to a 
delicate brown. Remove all skins and 
grind in a meat chopper, using finest 
knife. Put through six or seven times' 
or until oily enough to spread easily. 
Salt to taste at third grinding. 

Pack closely in covered tumblers.

To keep the country house comfortable 
during rainy periods in summer, it is a 
good plan to have the furnace always 
ready for starting during the spells of 
wet weather which usually occur during 
the summer season. It is only necessary 
to have ready a small wood fire, "easily 
built and as easily put out. It will help 
wonderfully to keep the air dry and 
sweet. 

Canning Berries without Cooking 

Wash, drain and pack berries in jars. 
Shake down so as to get in as many as 
possible. Put jars, when filled, in hot 
water to get thoroughly warmed through. 
Make a syrup by using the same amount 
of sugar you would in canning berries 
the ordinary way. Pour over berries 
boiling hot, let bubbles escape, put on 
lids, set in boiling hot water, cover up 
and leave until entirely cool. These have 
a delicious flavor. j. j. o'( .

Query 2038.— "What is meant by sweet 
herbs?" 

Sweet Herbs 

Broadly speaking, by sweet herbs we 
mean herbs used for flavoring and sea- 
soning, as parsley, tarragon, chervil, 
thyme, sweet basil, bayleaf, marjoram, 
mint and sage. 



Query 2039.— "Recipe for Cucumber Jelly." 

Cucumber Jelly 

Pare two cucumbers and cut in slices. 
Add a slice of onion, a stalk of celery, 
half a tablespoonful of nasturtium seeds, 
a piece of green pepper pod and half a 
teaspoon ful of sweet herbs, with water 
to cover. Let simmer until the cucum- 
ber is tender, then press through a very 
fine sieve. Season with salt, pepper and 
a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Then 
add, for each pint of liquid, one-third a 
package of gelatine, softened in one- 
third a cup of cold water and dissolved 
over hot water. Tint delicately with 
green, vegetable, color paste, and turn 
into molds, to harden. Serve, with any 
salad dressing, in the same ways that 
tomato jelly is used. 



Query 2040.— "Where can I get a pattern of 
a Bungalow Apron?" 

Pattern of Apron 

A bungalow apron is probably the 
same as a kimono apron. These can be 
purchased at department stores for 



thirty-nine cents ; the apron can -be used 
as a pattern, or a pattern may be pro- 
cured of any reliable firm dealing in pat- 
terns.

Query 2042.— "Recipes for Chocolate Pud- 
ding, steamed in individual cups, with hot 
chocolate sauce." 

Chocolate Custard, with 
Fudge Sauce 

For four cups of custard, melt one 
square and a half of chocolate; add two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and one-fourth 
a cup of water, and stir until smooth 
and boiling. Beat three yolks of eggs 
and one white; add one-third a cup of 
sugar and beat again ; fold in one white 
of egg, beaten dry, then add the choco- 
late mixture and one cup of milk and 
mix thoroughly. Butter the four cups 
and dredge the butter with granulated 
sugar. Set on many folds of cloth, or 
paper, in a baking dish; surround with 
boiling water; let bake until firm in the 
center. The water should not boil dur- 
ing the cooking. Unmold at time, of 
serving. The dish is good when hot or 
cold. At serving, pour over a hot fudge 
sauce. If the custard be loosened at the 
edge, it may be unmolded in perfect 
shape. 

Chocolate Fudge Sauce 

Melt two squares of chocolate; add 
one-fourth a cup of sugar and one- 
fourth a cup of boiling water, and stir 
and cook until smooth and boiling. Sift, 
together, three-fourths a cup of sugar 
and one level teaspoonf ul of cornstarch ; 
add half a cup of boiling water to the 
chocolate; then the sugar and corn- 
starch, and stir and boil five minutes. 
Add a teaspoonful of vanilla, and it is

Two cups of thick cream and two 

cups of milk may replace the one quart 

of thin cream. 



Query 2044. — "Recipes for Tomato Sauce 
for Boston Baked Beans; also for Tomato 
Catsup." 

Tomato Sauce for Baked Beans 

Tomato sauce is not an ingredient of 
Boston Baked Beans, but it is a good 
addition. Cooked tomatoes pressed 
through a sieve may be used. If de- 
sired, add two tablespoonfuls of corn- 
starch, smoothed in cold water, to a quart 
of hot puree ; let boil and use. 

Tomato Catsup 

Scald half a bushel of ripe tomatoes 
and remove the skins; add half a cup 
of salt, one pound of sugar, one table- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, three tea- 
spoonfuls, each, of ground mace and 
celery seed, two tablespoonfuls of 
ground cinnamon, and two quarts of 
vinegar. Boil slowly until reduced one 
half, then pass through a sieve, reheat 
and store in sealed bottles, or in tight- 
closed cans. A larger quantity of spice 
is desired by many. 



Query 2045. — "How may a forequarter of 
Lamb be steamed with simple house utensils? 
It is too large for my steam kettles." 

Steaming a Forequarter of Lamb 

A forequarter of lamb, folded to- 
gether, may be cooked in the usual home 
steam cooker. If too large, buy one 
half of the forequarter. 



Query 2046. — "Recipes for preparing can- 
died or crystallized cherries and pineapple, in

For a pound of drained fruit, cook one 
pound and a quarter of sugar and a cup 
of the water, in which the fruit was 
cooked, to the soft ball stage (ZSS^'F.) 
Remove from fire and pour over the 
fruit, set in a shallow dish. The syrup 
should cover the fruit. Return to the 
fire and let boil once. Set aside until

next day. Drain on a sieve. To the 
syrup add half a cup of sugar and again 
cook to 238°F. Put in the fruit, let boil 
once and set aside overnight. Repeat 
this process three times, adding half a 
cup of sugar each time. The fruit, by 
this time, will probably have taken up 
all the syrup it will absorb. Let dry off 
a little and store in glass, tight-closed. 
Pineapple in slices may need to be re- 
heated in the syrup four or five times. 
Each variety of fruit should take up all 
the syrup possible. Where fruit is can- 
died in large quantity, shallow trays 
provided with wire screens, to keep the 
fruit under the syrup, are used. 



Query 2047. — '* Recipe for 'Kentucky 
MinU.' " 

Candied Pansies, Mint Leaves, 

Etc. 

Set an ounce of gum arable and half a 
cup of cold water over the fire in a 
double-boiler and stir while melting. 
When cold use in brushing over the 
leaves, petals or blossoms. If flowers 
are used, the stems must be covered with 
the solution, as, also, both sides of leaves 
and petals. Let dry on table oilcloth. 
More gum arable may be added if the 
mixture be too thin to dry well. Make 
a syrup of half a cup of water and one 
cup of sugar. Let boil to 234** Fahr. 
When cold dip into it the prepared arti- 
cles and dredge with granulated sugar on 
both sides. 

We know of no recipe for "Kentucky 
Mints." Probably the above recipe is 
not the one desired; it is given as this 
is the season in which to candy mint 
leaves. If a more particular description 
of the recipe desired be sent, we may be 
able to publish the recipe.

quite hot at first? Is not half a yeast cake 
sufficient for three medium-sized loaves of 
bread? How stiff should the sponge be?" 

Heat of Oven for Bread 

A loaf of bread of average size should 
bake from fifty to sixty minutes. In the 
first fifteen minutes, the bread should 
rise to its full height and brown over in 
spots. Guage the heat to secure these 
conditions. Half a yeast cake is enough, 
if the bread be mixed at night. If the 
bread be mixed in the morning, use a 
whole yeast cake. Two yeast cakes will 
shorten the operation when that is an 
object. If such bread be baked thor- 
oughly, there will be no taste of ycasL 
Mix bread without waiting for a sponge. 
Reserve the sponge for mixtures in 
which sugar and shortening (which hin- 
der rising) are used.

Recipe for Two Loaves of Bread 



h a cake of com- 
pressed yeast (at 
night) 

1 a cup of water 

2 cups of scalded 
milk 



2 tablespoon fuls of 

shortening 
2 tablespoonfuls of 

sugar 
1 teaspoonful of salt 
About 7 cups of flour 



To the milk, or milk and water, add 
the shortening, sugar and salt; when 
lukewarm add the yeast mixed with the 
half cup of liquid, and the flour. Use an 
earthen bowl and mix with a knife. 
Knead until elastic. Let rise in a tem- 
perature of about 75°F. The shelf over 
the stove is not a suitable place. When 
doubled in bulk, shape into loaves. 
When again light bake about one hour^ 



Query 2052.— "Kindly give directions igr 
use of Pastry Bag and Tube." 

Use of Bag and Tube 

Fix the tube in place ; roll outward the 
upper part of the bag so as to put the 
mixture just above the tube without 
smearing the sides of the bag. Fill the 
bag about one-third full. With the right 
hand carefully twist the bag above the 
mixture, guide the tube with the left, 
hand, and force out the mixture by con- 
tinuing the twisting, at the same time 
using pressure, with the right hand. To 
form a star, hold the bag in vertical 
position and press out a sufficient quan- 
tity of the mixture. Separate the tube 
from the material by pressing the tube 
downward slightly and raising it quickly. 
For other designs hold the bag at other 
angles, between the vertical and a hori- 
zontal position. 



Query 2053.— "Recipe for Lady Fingers." 

Lady Fingers 

Beat the whites of three eggs dry and 
the yolks thick ; into the yolks beat half 
a cup of sugar and a grating of lemon 
rind; fold in half of the whites, half a 
cup and one tablespoonful, extra, of 
flour, then the rest of the whites. Line 
a pan with paper ; on the paper shape the 
mixture in portions aii inch wide and 



about five inches long; dredge with 
sugar. Bake about ten minutes.

Query 2057. — ^"Recipc for Broiled Live Lob- 



stcr. 



Broiled Live Lobster 



With a strong, pointed knife make a 
deep, quick cut at the mouth of the lob- 
ster, then draw the knife, firmly but 
quickly, through the body and entire 
length of the tail; with the tips of the 
fingers spread open the lobster to the 
center, and take out the stomach (or 
lady) and the intestinal vein, which runs 
from the stomach to the tip of the tail ; 
wipe with a damp cloth and spread in a 
well-oiled broiler. Brush over with but- 
ter and broil over coals about ten min- 
utes on the flesh side and five minutes 
on the shell side; or, cook in the oven 
about fifteen minutes. Set the lobster on 
a hot platter and crack the shells of the 
large claws. Serve melted butter in a 
dish apart. If preferred the meat may 
be removed from the shell before the 
dish is sent to table. The shell, if re- 
tained, helps to keep the lobster hot while 
it is being eaten. 

Broiled Lobster 

The above is the usual way of cooking 
broiled, live lobster, but, cooked accord- 



ing to the special formula, now given, 
the meat is more moist and less hard. 
Cook the lobster in court bouillon about 
fifteen minutes. Split lengthwise, 
sprinkle generously with melted butter 
and let cook nearly five minutes in a 
well-oiled broiler, over a rather dull fire. 
Break open the claws with a nut cracker, 
set on a hot dish and add a few bits of 
parsley. Serve butter, creamed and 
mixed with a little lemon juice and cay- 
enne, in a hot bowl. The heat of the 
bowl should melt the butter. To make 
court bouillon add vinegar, onion, celery 
and carrot to boiling water.

business can be applied successfully in 
the home. In every occupation and call- 
ing it is now known that no other than 
the best tools and appliances and the best 
methods can be afforded. Time, strength 
and cheerfulness of laborers all are to be 
conserved. Efficiency points to satisfac- 
tion and success in one's task, the lack 
of it to drudgery and failure. 

Read this book and note the efforts of 
one woman in applying "Standard Prac- 
tice" and "Motion Study" to household 
tasks. A single quotation may hint at 
the method as applied to one item of 
household routine. "Note, please, that 
my drainer is at my left and the dishes 
are stacked to the right. (The ideal ar- 
rangement is a drainboard on each side 
of the sink.) This will make a difference 
of ten minutes on a task requiring forty- 
five minutes. Note also that the dishes, 
and particularly silver, are sorted as laid 
down on the tray. Note that the drainer 
does away with all wiping of dishes. 
This cuts the time down considerably and 
saves the necessity of rubbing each piece 
with a dish- towel of doubtful cleanliness. 
While the dishes arc drying the pots are 
cleaned with a wire-bristle brush." 

Even the simplest task may be stand- 
ardized, and a better way found which 
will entail less waste motion, which 
means waste vitality. Industrial effi- 
ciency is no longer in the theoretical 
stage only ; in shop, factory and counting 
house, it is in full practice. Its applica- 
tion in the home points to a new and im- 
proved housekeeping and to homemaking 
as a noble profession. 



"Nothing ever suits her. She ain't

but, when folks drives in their spiggits

Fashion Dispenses with the Big 

Pompadour and Puffs 
By Dr. Leonard Keene Hlrshberg 

NOW that fashion has ruthlessly 
taken rats and all their kindred 
from women and decreed dose 
hairdressing and small heads, the prob- 
lem is a trying one. That many women * 
very sensibly solve it by making no ef- 
fort to achieve the radical in close hair- 
dressing is proved by the well-groomed 
heads seen on the streets. 

Moderately rolled pompadours and 
coils and knots and puSs are there 
a-plenty, but the fact remains that the 
smartest hair-dressing of the season calls 
for locks flatly coiled over the head, with 
a low pompadour or fringe to soften the 
forehead, and when this style suits the 
shape of the head and the face it is very 
pretty. 

Unluckily, instead of looking well- 
groomed, the head, whose owner has at- 
tempted to dress her hair in this fashion, 
is very likely to look uncommonly frouzy 
and matted. If the thing cannot be done 
well, it is better for wc^nen to hold to 
their pompadours and coils, and if the 
latter are more becoming than the 
"casque" and its kindred, hold to them 
anyway. 

The one law of hairdressing is that 
first, last and always the coiffure shall 
suit the individuality of the woman, and 
the woman who has discovered a simple 
and supremely becoming fashion of 
wearing her hair will do well to stick to 
it through all the changing modes. 

The modish hair to-day is most often 
parted and worn very low on the fore- 
head, a thing made necessary by the low- 
poised hats; and since it is difficult to 
make parted hair drop low over the cen- 
tre of the forehead, the fringe has come 
into favor. Not an old-time bang, mind 
you, but a mere shadow of a fringe that 
softens without hiding and breaks the 
line of the waving, parted locks without 
really fllHng in the point. 

Women, as a rule, do not take proper

care of the hair. They dry it out with 
frequent and careless shampooing and 
with hot irons, do not give it proper 
brushing, airing and rest, do not let it 
have oil enough to impart lustre and 
handle it so carelessly that they break it 
off with every combing. 

Such abuse brings about a condition of 
hair that does not lend itself readily to 
the closely coiled coiffure, which should 
be glossy smooth, exquisitely finished, 
though fluffy withal. The tousle-headed 
girl and the deplorable condition of the 
average woman's hair to-day are results 
of the cult of "fluffiness," and if smooth 
and beautiful and epidemic as the hobble 
skirt or the Robespierre collar, fashion 
makers would indeed have earned a per- 
manent place in the hearts of their fellow 
mortals. 

The hair ornaments worn with even- 
ing toilets tend to keep the hair in place 
and encourage the neat and trim air of 
the small coiffure, for most of them are 
on the fillet or bandeau order. Pearls 
and other jewels or imitation jewels are 
used. Sequin and bead bands, usually 
less expensive than the jeweled ones, 
are liked too, and any one of these nar- 
row bands is likely to hold an ornament 
posed wherever fancy dictates. 

Wide bands of jeweled gold galon or 
embroidered gold net, with or without 
narrow binding of velvet, are drawn 
closely around the head and finish with 
a Jeweled clasp or ornament, and velvet 
bands, embroidered in metal or jewels 
or beads, are much used too. In Paris 
many of these wider swathing bands have 
cabochons covering the ears and weird 
effects are exploited, such as the "mad 
tiara," which is a band of velvet with 
ear cabochons of velvet and gold and 
with straight egrets standing stifily erect 
all around the band, the shape of the 
head showing through the fine feathers. 

A very narrow Empire wreath of tiny 
gold leaves and pearl berries is an ador- 
able thing for a youthful head and inter- 
linked, small rings of pearls or brilliants 
make a pretty narrow fillet, as do 
braided strands of gold or silver.

How to Escape from a Small Job 

Every little while there comes to me a 
letter from some youngster who tells me 
that he hears Opportunity calling him to 
go to New York, or some other big city. 
He has figured that his home town offers 
him no chances. 

Perhaps it doesn't. 

Few towns ever offer anything to any- 
one. That much I've discovered in what 
little wandering I've done. 

It doesn't take one very long to dis- 
cover that the wise young man is spend- 
ing mighty little time looking for chances 
to get, but is, as a Westerner would 
say, "some industrious" in looking for 
chances to give. And, as those who have 
tried it know. New York and every other 
big city is calling for givers. 

In the city, where every faculty must 
ever be on the alert, only the great giver 
is the great getter. Many of my friends 
have tried the pace in the Big Town, 
and, after playing the game for a few 
months, gone back. Some less wise arc 
still stru^ling on. A few have suc- 
ceeded and are steadily climbing ahead. 

It is another case of "many are called 
but few are chosen." 

Only the fit survive. The unfit perish. 

The wise young man is he who gives 
until the institution or individual employ- 
ing him can receive no more. 

The way to move out of a small job 
into a bi^er one is to grow out of it. 
Likewise, one must grow out of the small 
town. 

Until one can swim across the creek, 
one had better refrain from attempting 
to swim the river. 

The advice of the cowboy, "Shoot 
from where your gun is," is good advice. 

Serve where you are. 

It is better to polish an office stool in 
Aurora, Illinois, than to polish a bench in 
Central Park. — Character.

we find Effront, the Bel^an chemist, 
obtaining human nutriment by the treat- 
ment of clover and hay, extracting their 
food elements without the intermediary 
of the animal that transforms them into 
meat. It is said that the solid paste ob- 
tained by this process is three times as 
nourishing as meat. "Why charge the 
ox or the sheep," he asks, "with the task 
of transforming these elements into a 
complex albumen which is not utilized by 
man until it has been degraded into sim-

To Make Southern Corn Bread 
The proper way to make real Southern 
com bread: Get good, bolted com meal, 
preferably water ground. Put in a deep 
pan or bowl. Boil the water to be used 
in mixit^ the com-meal batter. First 
scald the meal with boiling water. Then 
mix the dough as follows : Take enough 
of the scalded meal for about six people, 
pour in the boiling hot water until the 
consistency of a thick batter is obtained, 
working the substance thoroughly and 
fast all the while; also add two eggs 
while the batter is being beaten. Add 
salt to taste and pour into bake pans and 
bake it slowly in the oven. Do not use 
any sugar, butter or other grease for 
shortening; only grease the bottom of 
the bakepan or other receptacle into 
which the batter or dough is poured for 
baking. The secret is in properly scald- 
ing the meal before mixing and in the 
slow cooking. That is the old-fashioned 
Southern corn bread. 



Strawberries with Lettuce

jg1l|\ quarter-centuty ago grandma's mother told her how to 
" ^f^fS^ hathe a new baby girl. Today she, in turn, passes on 
\\ ^I(^\\ the same instructions to that ([irl now a mother herself. 

''' ■ And here is what she tells her : 

"Use soft water at a tempeiature of 9S degrees in vrinter 
and from BS degrees to 90 degrees in summer. Hold baby 
under a blanket. Moisten washcloth and apply Ivory Soap, 
first to the face and neck, then lo (he arms, next to the 
body, and last to the legs and feet. Remove soap wilh 
sponge. 'Pat' dry with a soft towel. Do not rub." 

These directions have survived the years because there 
never has been a soap milder or purer than Ivory and 
therefore none better suited for cleansing that most 
delicate of all things, the tender skin of a baby.

The Art of Basket Making 

By C. M. C. 



EVER since the days when the 
American Indians plied the trade 
of basket making, it has been an 
important industry. Looking back, it 
will be found that baskets were in those 
days the utensils with which the daily 
domestic hfe of the Indians was carried 
on. There were baskets for all uses, 
among the different tribes, and it was 
in the Southwest, along the Pacific slope 
and in Alaska that the art attained its 
highest perfection. The materials used 
at that time were largely determined by 
their environment, causing different 
tribes to make distinct and individual 
types of baskets. Sometimes they were 
fashioned from the wild rye, which is 
very pliable. Birch bark, fern stocks, 
roots, grasses, and willow were all used 
in their make. They were divided into 
two types, woven and sewed. 

The Indian women were very skilful 
at spUtting the stem of the willow and 
storing the materia! until needed. The 
proper time for gathering is when the 
stalk has completed its growth, and 
before it commences to harden. 

The baskets of today may be said to be 
descendants of those made by the In- 
dians, and prominent among them all, 
even today, is the Indian style of basket. 
Some of these are made with the "lazy 
squaw" weave or stitch, so called be- 
cause they are easier to make and require 
less thought than those in which has 



been put a whole life's work. For this 
basket we prepare the reed, trim it and 
shape it into a coil, winding the raffia 
thread and weaving until one coil of the 
reed is covered. This is the broad ex- 
planation, — in detail the following direc- 
tions may be followed. 

Hold the hemp coil in the left hand 
and wrap it with raffia for about an inch, 
wrapping it toward you. Then make 



HANGING PLANT BASKET

it into the smallest ring possible and 
sew it together firmly. Carry the raffia 
strand through the center, pointing the 
needle away from you. When the spiral 
is firm, begin to take the stitch, working 
toward the left and winding around the 
hemp once, and then taking a long 
fastening stitch down through the mid- 
dle. Then take the fastening stitch 
only on the last row of the spiral for the 
next row. 

If the squaw is inclined to slight her 
weaving, she will wrap the single reed, 
two, three, or four times before taking 
the much harder long stitch which holds 
the reeds together. In weaving the 
baskets, the raffia may be very coarse 
but must be kept even. The fingers 
should be slightly moistened with water 
so that the little fine fibers of the raffia 
will not wear up so readily, and it will 
take a polished surface. 

There are many kinds of baskets 
made by the modem basket makers and 
almost all of them conform to the law 
followed by the Indians. These baskets 
may also be constructed on pottery 
shapes, suggesting the bowl, cup or pan, 
rather than in singular or unusual forms. 
The sewing is done with a number 
seventeen.blunt, pointed tapestry -needle, 
threading with an unsplit strand of 



raffia. This is wrapped over the closely 
woven material called hemp packing. 
which comes in thick cables of eleven 
strands each, in the manner described 
above. 

It is always advisable to purchase a 
three yard coil, which saves the splicing 
too often. This splicing is done by 
laying a new strand by the side of the 
old and wrapping them firmly together. 

The cost of these baskets is ven,- 
slight, raffia being exceedingly cheap.and 
three yards of hemp packing, which 
retails for 35c. a yard, is more than 
enough for one of the largest size. In

the selection of the colored raffia, care 
should be taken to obtain only the soft 
and clear tones. 

It is a good plan to color the reeds 
oneself, but in order to do so, they 
should be put in a pan of hot water over 
the fire, and brought to a boil. Green, 
brown and grey are favorite colors, the 
warm earth brown showing off to ad- 
vantage almost any kind of a flower. 
The prettily woven basket is rapidly 
coming into favor as a receptacle for 
cut flowers and a jardiniere for potted 
plants. There is a tendency, however, 
towards the Arts and Crafts basket, 
which is of more simple design and 
weave. A lack of ornamentation charac- 
terizes the more popular baskets. 

Baskets of all kinds are used today for 
household decorations, and are in evi- 
dence for both table and room ornamen- 
tation. They have replaced to a great 
extent the taJl glass and the china vase, 
and admit of a much more natural 
arrangement of flowers. 

If cut flowers are to be sent to a 
friend, it is much prettier to put them 



in a small flat basket than to send them 
in a box, and it gives evidence of more 
consideration and better taste. Baskets 
can be designed and colored to harmonize 
with the scheme color of a room. Sug- 
gestions of delicate color may be wrought 
in a white groundwork for waste baskets, 
work baskets, and others to be used in 
a chamber, — while the deeper and more 
brilliant colorf may be employed for 
baskets to be used in den or library. 

RafRa dyed with vegetable colorings 
may be made harmonious in tones to 
blend with the colors of Oriental rugs, 
but for a cottage theie is nothing better 
than to follow the colors of the natural 
landscape, the greens and browns and 
the dull reds, making a blending of 
"woodsy" tones. 

For a small basket, simply shaped, 
eighteen pieces of the reed may be cut, 
each piece about thirty five inches long, 
arranging the pieces in groups after they 
have been soaked in warm water until 
they are tender. Three of these groups 
may contain four pieces, while the other 
one shows six. The center of each

group is then found, and two groups 
of four placed so evenly across each 
other that they form a letter X, while 
the remaining group is horizontally 
placed across the six. A table is a 
good place to lay the spokes, holding all 
the ends down flat until the basket is 
started. 

Place the end of the long weaver under 
the first group, forming the letter X, 



Run the weaver over the next group 
which will be of six, holding it down 
with the finger. Then it should be 
passed under the next group of four, 
reversing it and putting it over the next 
group continuing this process three 
times around until the top of the sixth 
group, is reached. Then run the weaver 
under the last two of that group and 
over the next one, going around three 
times and stopping when the same 
place is reached. When the groups are 
divided into twos, the weaver follows 
the process of over two, under '.wo, one 
time around. This is the foundation, 
and if anyone studying the art will 
follow very closely after these directions, 
he will not find any trouble in commenc- 
ing the foundation of the basket. Once 
this is learned, it is a very simple matter 
to shape it and finish it off. 

For tools, the beginner will need a 
pair of nippers, a pair of pliers, and an 
awl, although much can be accomplished 
with a sharp knife and a pair of shears, 
and a large knitting needle can be used 
if one has no awl. Before commencing 
the work, one should soak the material 
in warm water for from ten to fifteen 
minutes. If that is not obtainable, 
cold water will do, but it takes a longer 
time. The reed must be soaked until 
it is pliable and naturally the larger the

weave, the longer time it takes to make 
it flexible. 

After the basket is finished, a little 
sand paper removes any roughness; a 
coat of equal parts of turpentine and 
light oil finish may be used, or possibly 
gxiin shellac, previously dissolved in 
alcohol. Good paste or wax may be 
used also, but must be applied with a 
soft cloth and afterwards polished with 
a stiff brush. 



Originality of design is of great value 
as well as manual dexterity. At first, 
of course, it is well to copy good models, 
but half the benefit and pleasure is lost 
if one does not attempt originality- 
Experiment should be undertaken, at 
first along the well-known lines and 
with materials that have been tested. 
When one has had experience, however, 
one can do much with almost any kind 
of a reed, rattan, willow, or grass.

Essentials of Happy Homemaking 

By Eleanor Robbins Wilson 

To he happy at home is the ultimate result of all ambition; the end to which every enterprise and 
labour tends ^ and of which every desire prompts the prosecution. — Johnson. 



WHO ever saw a newly-married 
pair and did not feel that they 
had securely corralled Cupid 
by the surest and strongest measures 
extant? It is only the pioneer settlers 
of matrimony who know how soon the 
little gnawing discontents of domesticity 
may afford the small god a loophole for 
escape! **As though he ever would wish 
to escape!" Comes the derisive retort 
from bride and benedict, and the pioneer 
settler bethinks him of the man who 
once held a dime so close to his eyes 
that it blotted out the sun, as he sees 
them adjusting their self-conceit in the 
face of a glaring truth. 

If every couple entering the unculti- 
vated territory of wedded life coiild 
approach it in true pioneer spirit, know- 
ing the price of the new claim is eternal 
vigilance and that the bargain calls for 
team work, the well worn trail to the 
divorce court would soon fade from the 
landscape. For the comer-stone of 
successfiil matrimony was, is and always 
shall be co-operation. 

We rarely see a young man approach- 
ing the responsibility of providing for a 
home without having first gained the 
mastery of some trade or profession 
whereby he can assume the financial end 
of his obligation; but how about the 
young woman? Has she a working 
knowledge of housekeeping, does she, in 
fact.know any of the rudiments of home- 
making, or even the value of a dollar? 
We take much pride in shielding Beatrice, 
Rosalind, or Estelle from what we un- 
advisedly call '*the hardships of life,'* 
but what we inwardly know meant the 
bedrock of integrity and honest living for 
ourselves. We are justifiedly proud, 
too, of the little social graces she acquired 
at finishing school and in supplementary 

192 



travel, but what of the day of reckoning, 
when she marries the struggling young 
professional man and is left alone to 
fight out the handicaps of her early 
training? 

It is just this ferment of open revolt, 
working its way out in haphazard experi- 
mentation and through the divorce 
courts, that is furnishing the leaven for 
the new ideals of home-making and the 
establishment of domestic training 
schools throughout the length and 
breadth of our land. 

Not but that we should, each and all, 
say a hearty *'amen*' for all education 
that makes for true culture, but may our 
discernment lead us to the proper bal- 
ance of practical and ideal. One of the 
most revered educators in this country, 
who has dedicated her life to the study of 
Grecian Art and history, affords me a 
striking example of how warped one 
may allow her interests to render her. 
Although this woman maintains a large 
house, she is at the abject mercy of every 
tradesman whom she patronizes, and 
when serv'^antless, which is often, cannot 
make herself an acceptable cup of cocoa. 
Ensconced in a beautiful home, decorated 
along Greek lines and adorned with 
wonderful art treasures of ancient Greece, 
her's is often a choice of mal-nutrition, 
hunger-strike, or capitiilation to some 
animated Aphrodite blessed with a little 
culinary knowledge. All of which goes 
to prove that some domestic experience 
is as necessary for those who aspire to be 
competent mistresses as for the woman 
who expects to put her knowledge to 
practical use. 

Taken for granted that mutual love 
and respect are the basic principles of 
marriage and that absolute candor and 
fidelity on the part of each are the f unda- 



ESSENTIALS OF HAPPY HOME-MAKING 



193 



mentals of all successful home-making, 
qualification as wage-earner, for the 
man, and ability to keep or supervise 
a home, for the woman, are unquestion- 
ably the prime requirements in this joint 
undertaking. 

Perhaps, next in importance is for the 
wife to have a true valuation of money. 
If a daughter is to be debarred the edu- 
cational discipline of ever earning a dol- 
lar for herself, she should early in life 
be accustomed to the handling of money. 
Teaching the alphabet and inculcating 
the exacting rules governing the three 
R*s are matters of pressing concern with 
us, but the worthwhile initiation in the 
all-important task of money spending is 
left to the dubious methods of Chance. 
There is no better way to circumvent this 
prevalent condition of affairs than to 
entrust the daughter of tender years with 
a smaU allowance and to insist that the 
money given yield something in return. 
No matter if the amount is small, let 
it be thoroughly imderstood that it is to 
cover certain definite purposes ; so much 
for the Sunday school collection, so 
much for hair ribbons, so much for de- 
sired toys or books; but if, in a moment 
of temptation, the book money is rashly 
expended for bonbons, let no mournful 
entreaty induce you to increase the 
week's stipend, thus will the child learn 
the incalcuable lesson of the rigidity of a 
fixed income. And above all let the 
allowance be given with clock-like pre- 
dsion at the time specified, for regularity 
has an undeniable steadying influence on 
the yoimg. Undoubtedly, the best re- 
sults will be obtained where some small 
household service must be rendered in 
return for the allowance. Let Beatrice, 
Rosalind, or Estelle keep the plants 
watered, the canary fed, her bureau 
drawers tidied, and her room dusted,each 
day. Capability in handling a small 
amount of money should be rewarded by 
a gradual increase of allowance until the 
young woman is solely responsible for 
her individual needs . Such home school- 
ing in economics would leave the bride 



at the threashold of her own door quali- 
fied to administer the financial side of 
domestic affairs. A person so groimded 
will proudly lift her head above public 
opinion and find her greatest pleasure in 
standardizing her home. The penurious- 
ness of the neighbor on the left, the 
flaunting extravagances of the neighbor 
on the right would find no imitation in 
her household budget. Such a woman 
will not be guilty of squandering twenty 
dollars for an unnecessary willow plume 
and then pin her economical pride to the 
fact that she saves the rag money! 

And right here looms up another re- 
quirement of happy home-making and 
that is that there shoiild be a proper ap- 
portionment of the family income, the 
wife's allotment being » for stipulated 
needs of household expenditures and her 
personal requirements. For what shall 
it profit a woman to be efficient in the 
guarding and spending of money, if she 
is not allowed such share of the income 
as she is entitled? Let the head of the 
house, therefore, see to it that his wallet 
and his wife's wallet look like twins, 
remembering that even love fleeth from 
the hands of a stingy man. Let the 
wife also bear in mind that nowhere 
does unity of effort spell success or fail- 
ure more tellingly than in this selfsame 
domain. Notwithstanding the fact that 
a woman may be found adequate to dis- 
burse household fimds, she can through 
foolish moods and petty jealousies com- 
pletely bankrupt her partner. I have 
seen the jealous bride of a successful 
young dentist make such serious itjroads 
on his profession that he was obliged to 
abandon his practice in his home-town 
and establish himself elsewhere. And 
we have all of us known the envious or 
super-sensitive type of physician's wife 
who, through similarly unpleasant tac- 
tics and her own short-sightedness, has 
robbed the home-nest of some of its 
softest feathers. The harboring of sus- 
picion is a dangerous pastime. Oust it 
as a weed from the garden. For there 
is small incentive for a man to persevere

and keep doing right who is always sus- 
pected of wrong doing. 

After the financial question with its 
varying aspects has been agreeably set- 
tled, the next step toward connubial con- 
cord is found m husband and wife shar- 
ing some joint interest, and, in the goodly 
aeons this sturdy old world has been 
spinning on its axis, nothing seems to 
have filled the bill like the task of rearing 
a brood of lusty youngsters. There is 
yet to be discovered that which can give 
greater strength to the foundation of 
domestic relations or moie firmly weld 
the affections of husband and wife. 
And this does not mean the crushing or 
blotting out of individual interests for 
either the man or the woman. If the 
young husband sings acceptably or makes 
artistic pictures with his camera, by all 
means encotu^age such gifts. If, on the 
other hand, the wife plays some musical 
instrument, is talented in painting or 
clever with her pen, bid her continue. 
It will not only make for a richer and 
more interesting home-life, but it is 
sure protection against a certain form of 
domestic ennui that inevitably comes at 
the stage when people who are much to- 
gether become '^talked out," and thread- 
bare stories and decrepit jokes tend to 
remind the listener of phonographs and 
parrots. Moreover, it is well at the out- 
set to cultivate the forward glance, and 
the young woman fostering some form 
of self-expression through the busy per- 
iod of motherhood,has in the later leisure 
of middle life, given ardent thanks. A 
period she might otherwise have con- 
signed to loneliness and empty-handed- 
ness has proven for her the golden oppor- 
tunity wherein to nurse some cherished 
talent into beauty, to her own satisfaction 
and the ultimate good of all concerned. 
So much for the apparent big issues at 
stake, but what of the small undermining 
forces that work an insidious havoc? 
In the domestic circle as with the larger 
business transactions it is the trivial 
affair that often proves the most irritat- 
ing.. It is the petulant tone creeping 



into the voice that by rapid growth 
evolves into the chronic whine, and 
there have been cases where a whine 
proved a two-edged sword which severed 
the marriage tie. It is the little act of 
disloyalty in repeating to friends and 
neighbors the petty faults and foibles of 
the life-partner which sows the damaging 
seed of discord, and it is only the un- 
checked irritable complaint that with 
magician-like agility converts otherwise 
worthy people into intolerable naggers 
and Mrs. Gummidges of both sexes. 

In the April number of Scribner's 
Magazine appeared a short story entitled 
"The Way She Took It," so pulsating 
with the sweet breath of home-life and 
a common-sense understanding existing 
between husband and wife that it made 
most refreshing reading. On the eve of 
her Silver Anniversary a woman, for- 
tunately blest with the full complement 
of brains, was approached by a very 
friendly but totally iminvolved third 
person who felt it a boundcn duty to 
enlighten her on her husband's misde- 
meanors and short comings. Yet in the 
face of seemingly tangible proof, the 
wife's twenty-five years of intimate com- 
panionship, affording an unequalled 
study and thorough comprehension of 
her husband's character, stood her a 
solid background of facts. And the 
quiet majesty and wifely loyalty of her 
attitude are brought out most pleasingly 
and with cameo-like clearness. 

So it seems that the Sunday-go-to- 
meeting virtues of tolerance, patience, 
and kindness are often the uplifting 
wcrk-a-day mottoes of those charming 
abodes where we find the home atmos- 
sphere so restful and inspiring, — and 
unfailingly a sensible, sunny woman is 
the pivotal force calling into action all 
the surrounding, worthwhile interests. 

Thus we are slowly but surely learning 
the far-reaching value of good cheer. 
High on the scroll of marital b^titudes 
might be illuminated, "Blessed are the 
cheerful in heart, for they make home 
attractive." A sense of humor is the

life preserver in more than one ship sail- 
ing the changeful seas of wedlock and 
it is the saving vein of gold to more than 
one grub-staker in the rugged fields of 
matrimony. To make *'two grins grow 
where formerly dwelt a gfouch,*' is, in- 
deed, a subtle art and one worthy our 
stanchest efforts. Long years ago, Helen 
Hunt Jackson told us that '*Checrful- 
ness is a thing to be more profoundly 
grateful for than all that genius ever in- 
spired or talent ever accomplished. 
Next best to natural spontaneous cheeri- 
ness is deliberate, intended and persistent 
cheeriness, which we can -create, can cul- 
tivate and so foster and cherish that after 
a few years the world will never suspect 
that it was not an hereditary gift.'* It 
is helpful counsel to-day and especially 
applicable to the complicated task of 
home-making. 

In fiuther pursuit of domestic con- 
tentment, perhaps the new and even the 
old recruits in the connubial ranks can 
do no better than cultivate that other 
saving grace — tact. Insignificant and 
imassuming though it appears, it still 
remains a matrimonial blue ribbon win- 
ner and can boast an unblemished record 
of some of the happiest victories. 

It seems pertinent right here to state 
of the three thousand, six hundred and 
ninety-nine cases that were heard in the 
Chicago Court of Domestic Relations 
dtuing the past year, 11 per cent were 



occasioned by ill temper and fully 6 per 
cent were ascribed to the interference 
of the wife's parents. Whether or no 
what the small boy terms "squealing" 
is a feminine attribute, there is food for 
reflection in the statement that only 1 
per cent of the trouble investigated in 
this court was caused by the molestations 
of the husband's parents. 

Further infelicity was credited to the 
following sources : 

Disease, 13 per cent; 

Immorality, 14 per cent; 

Married too young, 4 per cent ; 

Laziness, 3 per cent; 

Miscellaneous, 6 per "cent; 

While under the one tragic word 
"Liquor" lay the heartache of 42 per 
cent. Yet, glancing below the surface 
evidence, he who runs may read a sad- 
dening tale of homekecping incompe- 
tency, of the serving of sodden food and 
the stronghold of financial mismanage- 
ment. 

Let our schools of household economics 
multiply! There are no stronger advo- 
cates of such institutions than they who, 
each day, are legally sifting the chaff and 
wheat of the divorce problem. It is 
becoming more and more patent that 
only through such a combined attack of 
trained efficiency may the rising gener- 
ation strike a more effectual blow at the 
hydra-headed serpent of domestic dis- 
content. 



Twilight Fraternity 



The shadows steal across the grass, 
They lay their fingers on the flowers 
And straip[htway into dreamland bowers 
The wildings of the meadow pass, — 
Then lightly o'er the sun-warmed road, 
They drape with gray each green abode. 

Deep in the ancient forest way 
From leafy turret, high and strong, 
The veery chimes a vesper song 
And day succumbs to twilight's sway — 
For birds, and bees, and fallow field 
Have felt the spell the shadows wield. 



On drifts the silver-stoled band 
O'er mountain height and lowly fen 
To still the fevered ways of men 
With the soft dreams of night-fall land, 
While granite cra^s and cloud-capped pass 
Grow dim as daisies in the grass. 

The flaunting poppies in the grain 
Are shadow-bound as yon drab fir, 
Crudcness is veiled with gossamer, 
And harshness learns a softer strain, 
As down the dark the garish day 
Finds kinship with a world of gray. 



A Yard of Rhubarb 

By Ruth Moench Bell 



ANEW home with an uncultivated 
back yard, a need for money for 
piano lessons for my little girl, 
and a jar of Rhubarb marmalade con- 
spired together to give a suggestion for 
improving the first, supplying the second 
and marketing the last. 

To begin with: My Httle girl had 
reached the age when I had always 
declared her musical instruction should 
begin; but we had just moved into our 
new home for which we had been saving 
so long, and I knew there was no possi- 
bility of pinching out enough from the 
family income for this new expense. 

I was standing at the window looking 
out on the bare back-yard and alter- 
nately wondering now best to improve 
the yard and wishing that my little 
girl's fairy god-mother would give two 
gentle -taps on the door and, enquiring 
into the cause of my perplexities, 
speedily wave her wand and transform 
that back-yard into a verdant paradise 
of green, penny-bearing plants. 

The wish was scarcely crystalized, 
when I was nearly startled by two gentle 
taps, not on the back door as I had 
wished, but on the front. Our bell had 
not been put on or the wish could not 
have been so literally fulfilled. 

I opened the door and there stood the 
fairy god-mother. I did not recognize 
her at first. Indeed, she seemed to me 
just like one of the neighbors come in for 
a friendly chat. 

I persuaded her to have tea with me 
and, with her fairy gift of divination, 
she must have learned the cause of my 
secret distress, for she offered me, in that 
enigmatical way the fairies have, the 
secret for my i)enny-bearing back-yard 
plants. 

I had on the table a most delicious 
rhubarb marmalade, the secret of which 
a famous Southern cook had confided 
to my mother. My neighbor friend 



ir 



<(i 



tasted, then exclaimed: '*How delicious 
this is. I do wish one could buy such 
dainties. They are so good for Tea. 
I dread so to make them and then I 
never have success even with a tried 
and tested recipe." 

Instantly the back-yard, the piano 
lessons, the jar of marmalade began 
capering about, figuratively speaking, 
of course, in my brain. I nearly flung 
my anps about that demure fairy 
creature who was pretending to be 
merely a friendly neighbor. 

I could scarce suppress my excite- 
ment as I bade her good-bye. 

''George, dear," I said at supper, 
"How would rhubarb do in our back- 
yard?" 

"Rhubarb?" He stared at me in 
masculine perplexity. 
Yes, Rhubarb." 

O, it would thrive well enough, but 
I thought you wanted something pretty 
there." 

"It isn't ugly, is it?" 

"O, no, not if it's properly tended. 
It looks fresh and green, but that's about 
all." 

"That's all I ask," I exclaimed, 
"Sadie's music lessons shall grow in our 
back- yard." 

He stared apprehensively ac me as 
who should say, "Am I — or is she.'" 

"We are neither one of us straight- 
jacket subjects," I laughed; "but we'll 
plant rhubarb in thac back yard. We'll 
sell and ship in the early part of the 
season and I'll make rhubarb marma- 
lade when people are tired ol the fresh 
plant. The stores can sell all I can 
make, I know.* 

Hubby and Sadie feli in with the idea 
and we set to work. Hubby had the 
back yard thoroughly ploughed and 
prepared for the planting and Sadie 
and I did the rest. 

We first visited a truck-gardener liv-

MAKING THE KITCHEN ATTRACTIVE

Ing on the outskirts of town and got 
plants and what little information there 
is necessary to raising them. 

First he showed us how to select the 
roots. Each piece of root must have 
one good bud or eye. 

They must be planted in sets about 
four feet apart each way. 

The ground must be cultivated and 
hoed and kept free from weeds. Never 
let the ground get hard and always 
remember that the richer the soil the 
better and bigger the growth and the* 
more tender the stalks. Roots may be 
set out either in spring or fall. 

This is practically all one needs to 
know, to raise rhubarb. 

The weeding and hoeing brought the 
roses to our cheeks and gave us the most 
voracious appetites. Then there was 
the joy of watching the plants grow, 
plucking the beautiful stalks, marketing 
and shipping. (It is an excellent ship- 
per.) Lastly, came the fun of making 
the jam and marmalade and selling them. 

I put a Jittle advertisement in the 
paper and found a surprisingly large 
number of customers, some of whom 
came to the house for the jam or mar- 
malade (I made two kinds), and others 
phoned, and my little girl became the 
carrier. 

Her enthusiasm and zeal were only 
equaled by my own, and I know she 
could never have appreciated her music 



lessons so keenly as she did, had it not 
been for the preliminary anticipation 
and cflfort to secure them. 

Of course, the lessons were deferred 
a year longer than I had hoped, because 
there is no profit till the plants are a 
year old; but we knew the lessons were 
assured, so there was no despair over 
the delay. 

Here are the recipes for the jam and 
marmalade : 

Rhubarb Marmalade. — I find a mar- 
ket for this all the year round. It 
looks very attractive in these new wide- 
mouthed glass jars and jelly glasses. — 
Two quarts of rhubarb, broken rather 
small, two pints of sugar, two oranges, 
juice of one and grated rind of other, 
one cup of chopped raisins, if you like, 
or one cup of broken walnut meat; or 
omit both raisins and nuts. Cover the 
pieces of rhubarb with sugar and let 
stand over night. Then add the other 
fruit and cook until thick. 

Rhubarb Jam. — Simpler and cheaper 
and very good. — Two pounds of sugar, 
and one lemon. Wipe the rhubarb but 
do not peel it. Cut into inch-pieces. 
Cut the lemon into halves, remove the 
seeds, press out the juice and chop the 
rind fine. Put the whole into a pre- 
serving kettle over the fire ' and stir 
frequently. Let it cook slowly one 
hour or until thick. If the rhubarb is 
old, it will need to cook two hours. 



Making the Kitchen Attractive 

By Mrs. A. G. M. Neil 



IT is the most attractive room in 
the whole house,'* exclaimed the 
visitor enthusiastically, as the 
bride showed her with well justified 
pride her trim little kitchen. 

'*That is what Jack says,'* responded 
the demure little bride. "I made up 
my mind that it should be, too. You 
see, we cannot afford to keep a maid 
for awhile and, as I must spend the 
greater part of my time in the kitchen, 



I resolved to have it as pleasant and 
comfortable as I could make it.** g| 

"Wise little woman,** commended 
the friend, as pictures of other kitchens 
flitted through her mind and she in- 
voluntarily compared them with the 
dainty one before her. 

It was a small room, for the house 
itself was tiny, but the attractive wall- 
paper — tiled effect in white and a warm 
shade of tan, — gave it the effect of 



m 



THE BOSTOM COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



being larger. 

''As the kitchen faced north and was 
so small, Jack and I thought the tan 
and white effect would be warmer and 
at the same time seem to give more 
space. Besides, it corresponds with 
the woodwork, dresser and other fur- 
nishings," explained the young house- 
keeper. 

The floor was covered with a good 
quality of linoleum in imitation of the 
hardwood floors, which also accorded 
well with the oak woodwork, dresser, 
capacious kitchen table and other fur- 
niture. 

The window shades were of tan to 
correspond, and the Dutch curtains 
were of white muslin, dotted with pale 
yellow poppies. These gave a very 
sunshiny effect to the room. 

There was a big, deep -seated rocker 
in the room, with soft, comfortable 
cushions of cretonne in yellow and white 
design,which almost matched the window 
curtains. 

A set of hanging shelves placed over 
the table contained the various cook 
books, as well as some really good 
literature and one or two of the current 
magazines. 

**I often have a minute or two, when 
I can sit down in the rocker and read, 
while I am waiting for things to cook,** 
explained the bride, "and I made up 
my mind I would have good reading 
at hand for just those spare moments. 
You have no idea how much reading I 
really get done in that way, and I work 
so much better afterwards for those 
brief rests in the big chair. I often 
accomplish odd bits of sewing, too." 
She indicated the pretty sweet-grass 
sewing basket with its yellow ribbons, 
placed on the top of the book shelves. 

There was a high stool in one corner 
of the room, which the bride explained 
she used when sitting up to the table to 
prepare vegetables, and to iron when 
her "feet got tired." Two other regu- 
lation kitchen chairs, a drcvsscr, a roomy 
kitchen table with numerous capacious 



drawers underneath, and the range 
were all the other furnishings which 
the small room permitted. 

Back of the door leading to closet 
and cellar were rows and rows of hooks. 
On these hung shining cooking utensils — 
convenient to hand, yet out of sight 
when the doors were closed. 

On the walls were two or three really 
good pictures — attractive landscapes in 
plain but neat oak frames to correspond 
with the color scheme of the room. 
These brightened up the room wonder- 
fully, and were restful and delightful 
to look at. 

"They were some of the prettiest 
pictures we had, so I put them in here 
where I would see them oftenest and 
where they would rest and refresh me 
while I was doing my w^ork." 

Over the kitchen table, beside the 
small book shelves, hung an artistic 
calendar, also with a pretty country 
scene on it, and with tne daies m good 
large print. There was also an attrac- 
tive memorandum pad with burnt 
leather covering, which the bride said 
saved her "lots of cudgeling of brains" 
about things she needed at different 
times or duties that required to be 
done. 

"It looks almost too pretty for use." 
"Indeed, it is not," answered the bride, 
quickly. "It is all for use and for com- 
fort. Everything in the room is wash- 
able, and I assure you is washed often. 
Even the wall paper is the washable 
kind. Everything is to make my work 
easy and pleasant, and to make my sur-: 
roundings as comfortable and attractive 
as I can have them in the room where I 
am obliged to spend so much of my 
time." 

"Do you wonder that I love my little 
kitchen?" she asked, with pride, "that I 
enjoy my work here, and never feel like 
hurrying through it and off to some 
other room where I can rest and enjoy 
myself?" 

"Indeed I don't," responded the 
friend, heartily. 



An Elxperiment in Exonomics 

By Susie Bouchelle Wight 



IT has been most truly said that the 
luxuries of one generation arc the 
necessities of the next, but it is 
only when their necessity is acceded to, 
that it exists. This fact is one we are 
prone to overlook in these days when 
everybody is discussing the high cost of 
living. There are a thousand demands 
for things that we have become accus- 
tomed to consider essential to our com- 
fort and well-being, which under a rigid 
common-sense examination would have 
to be classed either as luxuries, or else 
as concessions to the extravagant spirit 
of the times. 

I know a family who have recently 
been obliged to reduce their scale of 
living, and their methods are interesting 
and suggestive. For some years past, 
the father has been aware that they 
were spending more than they should, 
but his business belonged to him alone, 
and was one in which occasional deals 
brought in large profits, so in a mistaken 
spirit of tenderness for his loved ones 
he had gone on bearing the strain with 
an occasional feeble protest, depending 
upon fortuitous circumstances to make 
up the deficit. A time came, however, 
when a certain long-talked of business 
investment had to be foregone for lack 
of an inconsiderable sum of ready money. 

"Why," said the oldest son, "Ispend 
that much every year on my roadster 
alone — surelv we can borrow that?" 

"I will not borrow, while we live as 
we do," returned the father gravely. 
"We are living clear up to our income, 
and no margin is left for just such 
opportunitie > as might enable us, by 
and by, to enjoy the things \^e have now, 
and have no right to." 

I think, perhaps, it was the very love 
and gentleness, which was all these 
children could remember from their 
father, that made them enter so ear- 
nestly into the thorough discussion that 



followed. He never had cried *'Wolf," 
before, so now they came to the rescue, 
and the situation was handled, as all 
. such situation should be, with common 
consent, after common consideration. 

As is usual in any system of retrench- 
ment, the table was the first thing to 
come under the searchlight. It had 
been the family habit to have anything 
they wanted to eat, and of course they 
wanted the very best that could be had. 
The butcher's bill was eliminated at one 
fell swoop, and that was the largest item 
of the commissariat. They retained a 
good roast for Sunday dinner, and then 
depended upon butter and cheese and 
bacon for fats. A little study of break- 
fast fruits resulted in the choice of 
apples at half the cost of bananas and 
grapefruit, and in the substitution of 
stewed fruits, now and then, for fresh 
ones. It was found possible to make 
quite a saving in the choice of their 
vegetables. Sugar, which had gone in 
enormous quantities for fudge and kin- 
dred purposes, came to be looked tipon 
more as it had in the days of the parents' 
childhood, and desserts, of which this 
family were especially fond, were made 
the subject of a close and profitable 
investigation. 

When it came to clothes, these people 
thought, at first, that no difference 
could be made, until the daughter of 
the house quoted, *'It isn't doing with- 
out things that hurts — it is keeping up 
the bluff." 

"I don't know whether the bluff is 
worth keeping up," said the mother, 
and then, for the experiment's sake, they 
entered into an agreement to do away 
with everything included in that idea 
of "keeping up the bluff," those ex- 
penditures made partly from the love 
of ease and comfort, and with a weather 
eye to the neighbors' opinions. It is a 
queer thing, this concession to what 



199

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



people say. Seeing certain economies, 
the worst remark that is likelv to be 
made is that the Smiths have beeu 
living too extravagantly, and are having 
to mend their ways. If this is true, as 
very probably it is, why resent it? If 
they go still farther and observe, "It is 
what I knew they would come to," why 
resent that, or even worse insinuation? 
If our neighbors are wiser than we, so 
much to their credit; and if they cast 
reflections upon us — well, a little analysis 
of that word "reflection** will convince 
us that the unkind word and the thought 
behind it are greater evils than the 
shadow they may cast upon us. Our 
one affair is literally to attend to our 
own business, and what people may 
say depends for its importance exactly 
upon the importance we give it in our 
own minds. It looms very large with 
us, if we allow it to — to the world out- 
side, it is but a matter of casual remark. 

Well, this elimination of "the bjuff" 
proved the keynote of the entire matter, 
because it was seen that so veiy many 
of the luxuries depended for their 
largest value upon the fact that others 
indulged in them. Entertainments were 
reduced to a minimum ; recreations were 
brought to a simpler plane; articles of 
dress were not discarded simply because 
they had become pass6, but were re- 
modeled and altered at home, and one 
radical member of that family wore 
shirtwaists and plan skirts on all 
occasions, with such an air that she 
actually gave a distinction to her cos- 
tume. 

The telephone! Do we really need it, 
or is it here for purely social reasons? 
The small members indicated their 
willingness to run errands, and it was 
thought that, sometimes, purchases 
made over the phone, because it was 
an easy way, would not be made at all, 
if they involved a trip down town. 



True, the phone was constantly in use 
for Marion, but she said that if her 
young friends could not take the trouble 
to come, or send a messenger when they 
wished to communicate with her, she 
didn't feel like keeping a telephone for 
their convenience, only, she added 
falteringly, "It always sounds so kind 
of horrid when Central says 'That phone 
has been dicontinued.'" 

"Bluff*" commented the small boy, 
so after that month there was no longer 
the peremptory tinkle of the phone in 
that house. The question of electric 
lights met a similar disposal. 

In a nutshell, it all meant the fore- 
going of modem conveniences for that 
family, until such time as they could be 
really afforded, and it was a brave 
example that many in these days need 
to follow. Not one item of this whole- 
sale renunciation was large — some sav- 
ings were so small as almost to seem 
trifling, but the sum total largely justi- 
fied the experiment. The heavy burden 
was lifted from the man of the house, 
and because of it he became cheerful 
with his children in a way they had 
almost forgotten. A certain moral fibre, 
which is being developed in the younger 
members of the family, is the attempt 
at a mutual helpfulness, which has re- 
placed their former irresponsibility, and 
the healthy zest that comes with 
economic independence seems better 
worth while than the easy pleasure 
purchased at the price of their father's 
perplexity. The outcome is sure to be 
good. There will be the requisite mar- 
gin for business expansion, which means 
the interest of the family as a group, 
and the individuals working together 
for a common cause will have acquired 
pleasantly and happily those habits of 
thrift that, otherwise, must have been 
won — if won at all, through the stem 
discipline of defeat and loss. 




The Girl Who Cooked 

By Mary Carolyn Davies 



IT is not easy to bake a cake, and 
stir salad, and drain the potatoes, 
when your brain is just swirling 
with plots and settings and climaxes, 
and when the most fascinating little 
ideas and fancies keep dancing into 
your mind and fairly crying out to be 
written up into stories. Especially if 
the writing of them means, possibly, 
college in the fall ; and not writing them 
means, certainly, no college. 

And, besides, Nan hated cooking, 
anyway. At least, she had hated it 
before. It was Nan's proud boast that 
she never in her Ufe did anything she 
didn't want to. Her method, you see, 
was that as soon as she found she had 
to do anything, she immediately set 
about wanting to. 

It wasn't easy for Nan to be spending 
her summer over the cook-stove and 
the ironing board. That summer — 
why the very thought of it had borne 
her triumphantly through the rough- 
nesses of her year as backwoods ''school- 
marm." "Never mind," she would say 
gaily, as she tossed her head to keep 
back the tears, "Just wait till summer. 
Then, I'll be doing my own, own work. 
Oh, the stories that I can write — next 
summer." 

Three of "the girls" from their near-by 
schools, had ridden over to say Goodbye, 
as Nan left, radiant, the day school 
closed. 

"Be sure to tell us all about your 
writing, Nan," they called out. 

"Don't forget to let us know every 
check you get." 

"Good luck, Nan. College next fall." 
were the last words she heard as the 
train pulled out. 

College next fall? Yes, if hard work 
could bring it. With the study she 
meant to put in at the library, and the 
stories she had planned to do, she knew 
she could "make" college. It would 



mean giving up everything ; no vacation 
fun for her, but a steady grind at her 
writing. But for college. Nan could 
sacrifice anything. 

But when she got home, her plans 
went very badly "a-gley," indeed. No 
sooner had she flown into the house, 
dashed wildly at her mother, and her 
brothers and sisters of varying ages and 
freckle-faced dirtiness, in the midst of 
the kisses and fun, and home-again 
gladness of it all, than they began telling 
her how needed she was. 

It was good, good to be one of the 
home band again — not to be "the school- 
marm," and a pattern for the com- 
munity any more, but to be just Nan, 
to find her old place waiting for her 
just the same. 

She was longing for a chance to tell 
her mother all her summer plans, — how 
she would have her regular hours foi 
work, writing out under the cherry trees 
in the little nook where she used to 
study her Virgil, — how she would read, 
and study up on short-story structure 
and methods, and all the hundred and 
one plans she was so eager to begin. In 
her enthusiasm, she could scarcely follow 
the conversation. 

Conversation at the Little Brown 
House was of a three-ring circus variety 
invented by Nan and the others, destined 
to get the most said in the least time. 
Everyone talked at once, and yoti 
listened to whichever interested you 
most. Everybody cheerfully inter- 
rupted everyone, and a family talk was 
the joUiest, happiest - hearted affair 
imaginable. 

"Nan," her mother was saying, "I'm 
so glad you're back, and can take hold 
of things. I've let the housecleaning 
go, and I'm behind in the sewing, and—" 

"O Nan," Ted broke in, "I want you 
to coach me in Algebra this summer. 
You know I flunked."

''And now you can make my summer 
dresses for me, Nan," broke in "Lolli- 
pops,*' and teach me to embroider." 

''We've just been waiting for you to 
get here. Nan," her mother repeated, 
relief in her tone. "I had to keep up, 
some way, till you came." 

No one waited for Nan to make any 
reply, and no one noticed the white 
look of dismay in her face. It was gone 
on the instant, and Nan was laughing 
over Ted's telling of one of the twins' 
pranks. 

In some wireless fashion the news 
had got round the neighborhood that 
Nan was home. For anyone to say 
"Nan," was as much as sajring, "Fire, 
Fire." Everyone dropped whatever was 
to be done, and made a grand rush for 
the Little Brown House. 

Nan welcomed them all, from fat, 
homely Mother Bagley, to the Trum- 
bull babies. The doorbell and the 
telephone kept up a merry carol, and 
"Hello Nan" echoed everywhere. 

In all the merry chaos of talk and 
laughter, it seemed to Nan as if every- 
body said something about how nice 
it was that she had got home, and could 
"take hold of things," and give her 
mother a rest. 

"I wish I had a daughter Uke that. 
You're a lucky woman, Kate," her 
mother's chum told her, and Nan, 
overhearing, flushed. 

"But I can help more by working at 
my own work," she thought passionately; 
Anyone can sweep floors and cook." 

It was not until the supper dishes 
were out of the way that Nan could 
snatch a moment to think out this 
problem that had come to her. 

Then she ran lightly out to her own, 
little comer of the world — the little 
nook under the old cherry tree, where 
she had fought out all her girlish battles. 

There, all alone in the sunset, she 
faced her problem squarely, and had 
all the bitterness of her own little 
Gethsemane. 

"I can't give it up," she moaned, 



HTj.1. 



'It's my own, own work. And it 
means — college. I can't waste my 
splendid summer just doing other 
people's comers." She lifted her head 
to the sunset hills. "A girl must live 
her own life, and choose her own life- 
work." Impulsively she threw her arms 
around the old tree, and laid her face 
against it. 

"O what ought I to do?" she sobbed. 

But all the while, she knew what she 
would do. 

She had a little motto of her own that 
had steadied her hand sometimes, and 
she quoted it now, ruefully, through her 
sobs, "When in doubt, do the hardest 
thing." 

"Well," she straightened her slim 
figure, and stood out proudly, "here 
goes." 

It wasn't a very poetical surrender 
to duty, but she meant it. She marched 
steadily toward the house, stopping at 
the little spring to splash cold water 
into her eyes, and luring all the twinkle 
back. 

She remembered how scornfully one 
of the girls at High used to say, "Any- 
body can give in, but it takes a hero to 
give in as if he liked to do it." 

She flashed up to the porch, and was 
immediately taken possession of by 
every occupant of it. "Wait until the 
newness wears off," she laughed, "then 
I won't be so popular." 

"Where have you been, daughter?" 
her mother smiled up at her affec- 
tionately. 

"Having a little think-fest all by 
myself, muz," Nan answered, cheerily. 
"Will you tell me just what you have 
for breakfast, and how you cook it? 
You know I don't know a thing about 
cooking— but I'm going to." 

So that was how Nan came to be 
cooking dinner on this busy Saturday, 
while the tiny birds, bursting their 
throats with joy, and the lure of sum- 
mer, called to her in vain. 

She was tired, tired, body and soul. 
She was always tired nowadays, just 



THE GIRL WHO COOKED 



203 



as tired in the morning as when she 
tumbled into bed at night. But no 
one knew. 

She and the alarm clock had a little 
dispute every morning. The alarm 
clock always won. She had put her 
hand to the — stove-lifter, and she would 
not turn back. 

This was the tiredest day of all. The 
kitchen was littered up with everybody, 
and Nan was trying to thread her way 
through the laughing, quarreling chaos, 
to the culmination of dinner. 

"Say, Nan,*' suddenly demanded Ken- 
neth, sitting up straight, and looking 
over at her, "why don't you ever write 
any stories any more?" 

Nan tossed back her head, and 
laughed, holding up the dripping dough- 
nut on the fork, and turning her fire- 
flushed face upon him. 

"Stories!" she cried. "Oh— those 
beans are burning!" When she had 
rescued the beans, and put in a new 
panful of sizzling doughnuts, she turned 
again, and waved her arm tragically 
over the scene. 

"This is why," she announced, dra- 
matically. "It's better to live stories 
than to write them, Ke-Ke." she quoted 
blithely. 

"Yes," agreed "Ke-Ke," "but, gee! 
sis, your stories are corkers." 

"Thank you, gentle reader," she 
curtseyed, and, Hke Thackeray's heroine, 
went on cutting bread and butter. 

Nan had tried, for a while, to serve 
two masters. She had hoped to write 
in the corners of the day, but she soon 
found that her days were largely circular, 
and that comers were a non-existing 
quantity. 

Also, she discovered that stories and 
cooking dp not mix. If she ran to her 
notebook to jot down one of those 
faintly fugitive ideas, everything in 
sight would bum and boil over and 
mutiny. And when she would cuddle 
up in the lap of Fancy all by herself for 
a moment, it was surprisingly difficult 
to imagine what the girl did next, or 



to describe even a sunset. Then, just 
when her pencil would get in tune with 
things, and she would feel the glow of a 
well-turned sentence, "Nan," someone 
would call, and the little, maddeningly 
intrusive tasks would begin all over 
again. 

Finally, she gave in to the great god, 
Work, and locked up her pathetic little 
writing desk. She shut her eyes, and, 
standing under the old cherry tree, 
threw the key just as far as she could. 
Then she put all her heart into feeding 
the family, and sewing buttons on them, 
and dimpling out at the world in general. 

And nobody even guessed about the 
slender little key she had thrown away, 
and the locked-up place in her heart. 

When any of them spoke of her 
writing, she turned them off gaily, as 
she had Kenneth, today. His reminder 
had opened the old sore for a moment, 
but before dinner was over, she was her 
own cheery self again. 

A little later, the twins plunged in 
with the mail, to where Nan, arms in 
the steaming dish-water, was singing 
away. 

"There's a letter for you," came their 
two-fold shout, "Open it quick, Nan!" 

Nan's letters were an advent to the 
whole household, as much to be shared 
as a box of candy. 

Laughing, she wiped her hands on 
her apron, and, pulling out a hair-pin, 
ran it under the flap. Out of the 
envelope dropped a clipping. 

"The letter's from Pauline, the school- 
ma'am in the next district," she an- 
nounced happily, and, perching on the 
table, read out the droll, jolly epistle. 

In the middle of a sentence she stopped, 
"M — ^m," she skipped, and then started 
reading again, halfway down the next 
page. 

Nobody noticed the omission except 
her mother. Mothers always notice 
things. 

Nan's mother had confided to her 
best friend, the day before, "You never 
know your children are growing up.

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



Nell, till they first stop showing you 
their letters. Then you suddenly realize 
that they're not your little boys and 
girls any longer, but young folks with 
an individual life of their own. Nan 
always tossed her letters over to me, 
as a matter of course, before she read 
them or after, it made no difference. 
But now — It's foolish of me to mind, 
of course." She had laughed at herself, 
but she did mind, all the same. 

Nan had not dared show her mother 
the girls' letters this summer. They 
were too dangerously besprinkled with 
gay little references and questions about 
Nan's writings and checks — and Nan 
would not, for worlds, have had her 
mother know what she was giving up. 

That night in her room Nan read 
again the page she had skipped. 

'*I suppose you are too busy with 
stories, and big things to be interested 
in it," Pauline said, ''but I'm enclosing 
a clipping I noticed in the Homemaker's 
Magazine. You said you were doing 
some cooking, didn't you?" Then she 
went on to ask about Nan's stories and 
checks. 

Nan picked up the clipping. "A 
Contest! First prize, three hundred 
dollars," she gasped. "And for a cook- 
ing article," she read on farther, "telling 
the experiences of an amateur, and what 
she learned. Well, I certainly ought 
to be able to give a heart-felt experience 
talk." She laughed at a sudden vision 
of her soda-less biscuits, siu'plus-salted 
rice, and a few other of her strikingly 
original versions of culinary prowess. 

"And that's something I could scribble 
at in odd minutes — no, half -minutes," 
she corrected. "Dare I? Of course, 
I'd never win any of the prizes, even the 
least, last, tiny one. But — I've half a 
mind to try. Shall I?" She remem- 
bered the man, who, with a cake in his 
hand, stood so long before the oven 
door saying, "Shall I, or shan't I? Is 
it time, or isn't it? She loves me, she 
loves me not," that the oven got cold; 
and she determined to decide at once. 



She shook a quarter out of her bank, 
and balanced it tentatively in her fingers. 
Nan believed in tossing up. "Of course, 
I don't always do what the coin says," 
she explained ingenuously, "but I always 
find out, when it comes up heads, 
whether I wanted it tails or not." 

She put her head on one side judi- 
ciously. "Heads I write it, tails I 
don't." 

The coin flashed in the air, and came 
down — tails. "Oh, but, I wanU to," 
she cried out, sudden disappointment 
in her tones. 

Then, "Two out of three," she 
dimpled, and tossed again. Heads it 
was and she gravely accepted the 
decision. 

It wasn't until late the next day that 
she began the important article. Then 
it was launched by a paragraph on a 
piece of wrapping paper, hastily jotted 
down, in the kitchen. Every day, 
between courses, she would add a few 
sentences, and all the fun and blunders 
went into it, as they occurred. 

Nan kept her little secret to herself; 
if it came to nothing, she didn't want 
anyone to be disappointed. She wasn't 
at all sure of finishing. Besides, she 
shrank in a perfect agony from discussing 
her writing or hearing anyone speak of 
it. They had always laughed at Nan 
for her sensitiveness about her "scrib- 
blings." She co\dd not stand to hear a 
line of hers read aloud, and to reduce 
her to an agony of embarrassment, one 
had only to quote a phrase. 

Her article was nearly finished now. 
She did not want to send it without 
telling her mother about it. For several 
days she fenced for openings, she tried 
to introduce it naturally, but each time 
cowardice overcame her. At last, she 
resolved grimly to shut her eyes and 
fall in, the way she had learned to dive. 

She marched boldly into her mother's 
room, feeling the pulse in her throat 
throbbing so wildly that she could 
hardly breathe, y 

"Mother," she began, "I have some- 



THE GIRL WHO COOKED 



205 



thing I want to tell you." 

"Yes, dear," her mother looked up 
encouragingly, from the rompers she 
was making. 

'*It's," — Nan's courage was oozing — 
**I — ^you see — I wanted to tell you before 
I did it — I wanted you to know first — " 
Nan stopped, overcome by confusion. 

The look of puzzlement on her mother's 
face suddenly changed. '*Why, Nan," 
she cried, horrified, ''Surely it's not — 
You're not thinking of getting married, 
are you?" 

*'0h, no, muz! No, no," protested 
Nan, in terror. "It's only, don't you 
see — I've been trying to write a cooking 
thing, for a prize." And she told her 
all about the precious contest. 

"Well, I am* relieved," her mother 
smiled. "But, Nan, next time you 
write a story, don't scare me into ex- 
pecting an elopement, or a confession 
of crime. May I see it?" 

The ordeal over, Nan's story sailed 
on to a magnificent close. It was 
cleverly done. And yet, when she 
rounded out the last sentence, she was 
not satisfied. There was so much more 
to tell. She hadn't dreamed of the 
romantic possibilities in cooking. , 

"Now, tomorrow," she thought, "I 
will copy it, and get it all ready to send." 

But tomorrow brought a dismaying 
quantity of extra work, and the next 
day and the next sped by without a 
minute free from house cares. It was 
getting dangerously near the closing 
day of the contest. 

Saturday, they were going to have a 
picnic, "a regular cracker jack of a pic- 
nic," Kenneth characterized it, and it 
had the usual sandwich-cake-salad-pack- 
ing prelude the evening before. 

As Nan had her tired hand on the 
electric switch, going to bed that night, 
her calendar glared steadily and accus- 
ingly at her. She saw the date, and 
gasped. 

Tomorrow was the last chance for the 

contest. 

Was it worth the sacrifice, she asked 



herself. She had no chance of winning 
a prize anyway. "Aw, don't be a 
piker," she seemed to hear Kenneth's 
boyish voice. That decided her. 

"I'll stick it out," she said. "I'll 
cross the tape, now that I've come this 
far, even if I am the last one in the race." 

Next morning she laughed off the 
protests, and packed off all the others 
to the picnic, then drew a long breath 
of relief. Now she could settle down 
to work. 

Laden with her fountain pen, paper, 
and three sofa cushions, she fared forth 
right joyously to her own comer tmder 
the cherry trees, stood there a moment, 
arms stretched up ixi sheer abandonment 
of joy to the happy sky, then threw 
herself down on the gra^s to write. The 
birds seemed to welcome her back and 
the still morning was a balm to her 
cumbered- with-much-cooking soul. 

Her pen flew over the shining pages, 
and when the last line was copied, and 
the finished article folded down and 
slipped into the big overcoat of an en- 
velope, with the return envelope pinkly 
stamped and tucked away, Nan breathed 
a big, big sigh of relief. 

"There, that's done," she whispered, 
"but I won't feel real, real safe till I've 
fed it to that hungry green monster 
across the street," and in another 
moment she heard the satisfying thud, 
as it dropped into the mail-box. 

"Now, I'm never, never, going to 
think of it again," she disciplined herself, 
for I'm not going to feel disappointed. 
I'd better bake up some pies for to- 
morrpw, and get some hominy on to 
cook." 

So, ushered in by Cream of Wheat 
and griddle cakes, day after day went by. 

Nan had forgotten her manuscript — 
in the daytime. For the first week or 
so, sometimes at night, she couldn't 
help wondering if — But she always shut 
her eyes tight and stopped short at that 
point. 

Vacation was nearly over. Nan had

When Come the Evil Days 

We who look backward, who the long way know 
Would we our bitter wisdom dare bestow 

On those whose eyes look forward, self-de- 
ceived, 

Blest in believing all we once believe J? — 
Would we have springtime fear the winter snow? 

We who have seen the way the roses go, 

Were happy while we watched the brief buds 

grow: 
Let us be silent, we the oft bereaved. 

We who look backward ! 

Barren the fields they seek with hope aglow — 
There oft we sowed the seed that did not grow. 
How oft we wept the harvest slender-sheaved, 
Now we weigh dreams against the things 
achieved. 
Oh we could speak! But dare we rob them so — 
We who look backward? 

Stokely S. Fisher. 



INTEREST IN WORK 

THAT interest in one's work or 
calling is essential to successful 
achievement is a trite and common say- 
ing; and, yet, the fact must be kept con- 
stantly before us. Children, we say, 
must be interested in their studies and 
books or they fail in approved attain- 
ments. Right here is to be seen the 
difference between the old and the new 
education. To-day the natural activi- 
ties of the child are given employment. 
He is kept busy in doing what he wants 
and Ukes to do. He is lead and directed 
rather than forced and driven. Culti- 
vation and training are encouraged along 
lines of natural tastes and tendencies. 
EflBcient life work pointy to the spirit that 
inspires the best educational thought of 
the day. 

Is not lack of interest and earnestness 
on the part of women, in the daily routine 
of life the main cause of many a failure in 
housekeeping or home-making? And may 
not this fault, if fault there be, be due 
largely to the old time ways of training 
for efficient practical life? We must 
catch the spirit of betterment in the 
ways of living and make haste to adapt 
ourselves to the new conditions. It is 
the duty, rather the privilege, of every 
one to cultivate an interest in his work. 
** Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, 
do it with thy might*' is good advice, 
and sound philosophy. We admire the 
man who is enthusiastic and in earnest 
even though he plead a poor cause. But 
a lively interest in one's work and calling 
tends to lift the meanest of tasks from 
the sphere of drudgery to that of useful 
and noble service. The employee, who 
can say he just loves his work, will not be 
compelled, in all likelihood, to ask for an 
increase in wage. 

RESERVED STRENGTH 

A MOST pitiable object is the per- 
son who can not amuse and enter- 
tain himself, who is helplessly dependent 
on others for active occupation and 



EDITORIALS 



207 



amusement. Often he becomes an un- 
pardonable bore or nuisance. Internal 
resources are a treastu'e most persons 
may possess. Children shotdd be taught 
early and late, in season and out, to 
occupy and amuse themselves, to acqture 
steadily a fimd of resources from which 
they may, unconsciously, draw to tide 
over, otherwise, many a bitter idle hour. 
And we have so many objects to in- 
terest and incite to constant, active life, 
that idleness would seem well nigh im- 
possible. There are tools and work, 
games, books and music, also all out-doors 
with almost cotmtless subjects of attrac- 
tion and delight; and there is the silent 
hour for thought and meditation, so 
inestimable in value to many; for "out of 
silence comes thy strength.*' Surely the 
means and sources for storing up re- 
sources at self-command are inexhaustible. 
The failure to attain must come from 
improper instruction in early life. The 
cultivation of natural, instinctive inter- 
ests have been neglected or misdirected. 
Anyhow we have come to realize that 
the idle and indolent are a biurden to 
carry; while for the common loafer 
society has no use. 

CONTENTMENT VERSUS SATIS- 
FACTION 

DOES the chiu-ch teach that a man 
shotdd be satisfied with his present 
condition, no matter what that condition 
may be? Long hoiu^, short wages, un- 
sanitary workshops, unhealthy homes, 
uneducated minds? Nothing could be 
farther from the truth. The whole trend 
of its teaching is in the opposite direc- 
tion. Some men are sneeringly saying 
that the Church teaches submission, and 
that, therefore, it is an obstacle in the 
way of real progress. I want to point 
out the difference between being '*con- 
tent" and being "satisfied." The Bible 
exhorts men to be content. It does not 
teach that they are to be satisfied. 

There is a great difference between the 
two. St. Paid said that he had learned, 
in whatsoever state he was, "therewith 



to be content.'* He had learned how to 
make the best of things as they were. 
But in the same epistle he added: "Not 
as though I had already attained, either 
were already perfect. This one thing I 
do: forgetting the things which are be- 
hind (the successes and the failures), I 
press on." He was content, but not 
satisfied. 

Satisfaction is derived from the Latin 
words "satis" and "facio," which mean 
making or having enough. Content- 
ment is from the Latin "contineo," which 
means to contain, or to hold one's self 
together. 

Contentment lies in one's self. Satis- 
faction is derived from external objects. 
Contentment means the enjoyment of 
what one has, but it does not imply that 
one has reached the ideal. It is not in- 
difference or laziness. It does not de- 
moralize character or hinder noble aspir- 
ations or brave endeavor after improve- 
ment. 

It does mean, however, that one is self- 
contained, — the master of one's self. 
No man can reach out after better and 
higher things until he has conquered 
himself. Solomon, the wise king, once 
said, "He that ruleth his spirit is greater 
than he that taketh a city." 

And so the Church is with the toiler in 
his struggles after better things. It does 
not teach that a man must be satisfied. 
It does teach that a man hould learn to 
be content, — and so does common sense 
teach it. — Rev. Charles Stelzle, in the 
Presbyterian Advance, 



THE statement of Irene E. MacDer- 
mott of Pittsburg, at the National 
Education Association, held recently in 
Salt Lake City, is worthy of notice. 
"Education," she declared, "ought to be 
made so to increase efficiency that em- 
ployers will voluntarily raise wages. 
Education is more effective in preventing 
immorality among girls than a minimum 
wage." Apropos of Miss MacDermott's 
statement, the writer remembers how, a 



208 



THE BOwSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



few months ago, while passing through 
one of our large department stores in 
company with an assistant manager talk- 
ing on the subject of morality and wages, 
the manager suddenly stopped and, 
pointing to a young girl back of a parcel 
cotmter, said, ** Watch her tie up that 
bundle." The girl und3r observation 
had cut off a piece of wrapping paper 
twice the needed length; then she placed 
around the bundle three times the amount 
of twine necessary, taking for this simple 
operation more than enough time and 
keeping the customer waiting. While 
she worked she was chewing gum. 
"That's what we're up against," said the 
manager, — * 'inefficiency, wastefulness. 
That girl has been shown how to tie up 
bundles, but she simply doesn't care how 
much she wastes. Tell me how we can 
afford to pay such help more than we do? 
We'd gladly pay more if she were worth 



more.

The ability to be alone without being 
lonely is a good index of character. The 
summer gives opportunity to almost 
every one for the testing of ability in this 
direction. To judge from appearances, 
the world is not big enough to make 
such experience possible, or there are 
few people who really want to get off by 
themselves, or in making the effort so 
many congregate in favorable places 
that the very effort defeats itself. Few 
sights are more depressing than the sight- 
seers abroad who herd it through art 
galleries and the pleasure-seekers at 
home who fill the wide porches of the 
summer hotel. Being alone is what they 
seem to dread and avoid. They come 
to nature for rest and peace, and bring 
the very associations that made them 
need a change. What would often do 
the most good would be a temporary de- 
sertion by every one from every one else. 
— The Christian Register. 



"Get leave to work 
In this world, — 'tis the best you get at all 
Get work ! Get work 1 
Be sure 'tis better than what you work to get." 



AN OBJECT 

The reader of a culinary journal should 
not expect to find in each issue absolutely 
new recipes or items that promise sure 
cure of all household perplexities. New 
ideas are desirable and always to be 
sought for, but other matters are also 
to be esteemed. Interest in one's work 
and occupation is to be kept up; in- 
centives to higher efforts are to be wel- 
comed ; in a word, we need constant inspi- 
ration, in order to attain the best 
results in any occupation. Information 
as to what others are doing, or up-to-date 
knowledge is quite essential to good 
every day workmanship as well as to all 
future progress or betterment. In these 
ways the household publication should 
be found helpful. 



Why should the average country girl 
be more adapt in manipidating things 
outside than inside the house, unless it 
be that she has been humored and trained 
in that way? Far too frequently, it 
seems, in the country home, the mother 
does the cooking and the house-keeping, 
while the daughter drives the horses. 



That which we hear is nothing new, 
but the old truth uttered in the new 
accents of faith. There are no new 
heavens overhead, but the old heaven 
better understood. There is no new 
earth under our feet, but the old earth 
better known. There is no new revela- 
tion, specially made, but the unending 
revelation, newly read. — G, B. 



Senator Hoar once had a dear friend 
ill with appendicitis and was becoming 
uneasy, when a letter announced joyfully 
that the surgeons had declared the ill- 
ness not appendicitis,after all, but acute- 
indigestion. "That is good news," 
said the senator. **I rejoice that the 
difficulty lay in the , table of contents 
rather than in the appendix." — Sat- 
urday Evening Post.

Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 

IN all recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured aftei 
sifting once. Where flour is measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a 
level cupful is meant. A tablespoonful or teaspoonful of any designated material is a 



Oyster Chaudfroid 
(Hors d'Ouevre) 

USE large oysters; take one or two 
for each service. Set them over 
a quick fire and shake the pan 
occasionally, until the liquid around the 
oysters is heated to the boiling point; 
cover, and let simmer about three min- 
utes. Drain the oysters and let chill on 
or near ice. Have ready one cup of 
aspic jelly, made of three-fourths a cup 
of chicken broth, seasoned with celery, 
carrot and onion, and one-fourth a pack- 
age of gelatine, softened in one-fourth a 
cup of cold water, also half a cup of thick 
mayonnaise dressing. When the aspic 
is quite cool but not "set", beat it very 
gradually into the mayonnaise. Use 
this aspic mayonnaise to coat the chilled 
oysters. Set on ice to become firm; set 
a ring cut from an otive on each oyster, a 
figure cut from a pimiento in the center, 
then cover with a little half-set aspic 
(without mayonnaise) to keep the decor- 
ation from drying. Serve, on rounds or 



ovals of toasted or fried bread, before the 
soup or in place of it. 

Small Bouchees, Caroline 

Bake chou paste (cream cake mixture) 
in small, round or oval shapes. Cut off 
the tops (when cold) and fill with hard- 
cooked eggs, cut in small, neat cubes, 
and truffles, cut in the same way, mixed 
with mayonnaise dressing. Serve as an 
appetizer. 

Roulettes 
Have ready thin slices of oatmeal, 
Graham or Boston Brown Bread, with 
crusts removed. Spread these with 
chopped and pounded chicken or ham 
{or both) mixed to taste with anchovy 
paste and chopped capers. Roll each 
slice neatly, butter the outside of each 
roulette lightly, then roll half of them in 
chopped parsley and the other half in 
chopped white, or sifted yolk of egg. 
Serve as an appetizer at dinner, luncheon 
or high tea.

Baked Bluefish 
The fish used in the illustration was a 
bluefish weighing about five pounds. 
Other sea fish or black bass may be pre- 
pared in the same manner. As thus pre- 
pared every morsel sent to the table is 
edible and the dish presents a much more 
attractive appearance than when the 
fish is sent to the table whole. Remove 
the head of the fish, then cut down both 
sides of the back and remove a narrow 
strip of sldn with fins attached; remove 
also a strip from the front of the fish in 
the same manner, then loosen the skin 
below the head from the flesh, grasp 
the skin with the fingers of the left hand 
and, keeping the back of a knife against 
the breadth of the fish or the edge against 
the sldn, push and pull the skin from the 
flesh on both sides; now cut the flesh 
from the bones on both sides, leaving as 
little flesh on the bones as possible; re- 
move any single small bones that may 
remain near the head of the fish; wash

salt, half a teaspoonful ormore of paprika, 
and a grating of nutmeg. If convenient, 
use a pint of chicken broth with about a 
cup of water or tomato pur^e, in cooking 
the rice. When cooked stir through it 
(with a silver fork) the juice of half a 
lemon and about one -fourth a cup of but- 
ter. Butter a border mold; fill it with

sauce over the chicken. The rice may 
be shaped on the serving dish with a 
spoon instead of in a mold. 

Panned Chicken 
With a strong, sharp knife cut down 



both sides of the back-bone of a young 
chicken, spread out the flesh and remove 
all the internal organs attached to the 
back-bone. Wash the meat, wipe dry 
and set, skin side down, on a rack in a 
baking pan. Lay slices of fat salt pork 
on the meat and set to cook in a hot oven ; 
after fifteen minutes reduce the heat, 
cover closely and let bake until tender. 
The chicken should be juicy and not dry 
in the least. Serve with it broiled bacon 
and the liver. Garnish with toast-points, 
dipped in the liquid in the pan, and then 
in fine-chopped parsley.

ing. Reduce the heat, after twenty min- 
utes, and let cook from an hour and a 
quarter to an hour and a half or three- 
quarters, as a rare, medium-rare or well- 
done piece of meat is desired. Turn 
the meat when half-cooked. About half 
an hour before removal from the oven, 
dispose around the meat in the pan 
potatoes, pared and cooked fifteen min- 
utes in boiling water. Baste the pota- 
toes, when the meat is basted. At no 
time should the fat in the pan be heated 
enough to bum. Meat cooked at too 
high a temperature is never satisfactorily 
cooled. 

Pie from Remnants of Loin Roast 

Cut the remnants of meat from a roast 



water and set them in regular order on 
the paste; set the paste above the meat, 
letting it rest on the meat and the edge 
of the dish. Bake about half an hour. 

Biscuit Paste for Meat Pie 
Sift together two cups of sifted pastry 
flour, two rounding teaspoonfuls of bak- 
ing powder and half a teaspoonful of salt. 
Cut in one-fourth a cup of shortening and 
mix to a dough with milk {from half to 
three-fourths a cup of milk will be 
needed). Turn on to a floured board,

all unedible portions. Put the bones, 
gristle, etc., and left over gravy or sauce 
in a saucepan, cover with cold water and 
let simmer an hour or two, then drain off 
the liquid ; in this broth simmer the pre- 
pared meat until tender. It will take 
two hours or longer to render the meat 
perfectly tender. Turn the meat and 
broth into a shallow pie dish and season 
with salt and pepper. Have ready some 
baking-powder biscuit-mixture, rolled 
into a thin sheet ; cut this to fit the top of 
the dish, stamp out some ornaments,

The fillet from the rump of beef weighs 
from two and a half to three and a half 
pounds. To be served cold, it may be 
covered over when set into the oven with 
slices of fat salt pork, instead of being 
larded. Cook as any roast, basting fre-

Bernaise Sauce 

Chop, fine, enough mild onion to make 

two tablespoonf uls ; add a slice of green 

pepper, chopped fine, and one-fourth a 



cup of vinegar; let stand on the shelf of 
the range about half an hour, then strain 
through a piece of cheese-cloth, pressing 
out all the juice; meanwhile, add the 
beaten yolks of three eggs and a table- 
spoonful of butter ; set over hot water and 
stir constantly, while adding butter in 
small pieces, until half a cup in all has 
been added. Finish with a tablespoon- 
ful of parsley, chopped exceedingly fine 
and wrung dry in a cloth. If the pars- 
ley be not fine, it will clog the pipe when 
the sauce is set in place. 

Egg-and-Tomato Salad

cooled milk. Stir in about three cups 
of bread flour. Beat the mixture until 
smooth, cover and set aside out of

rounds may not shrink when cut, and 
cut into rounds; set a bit of butter on 
one -half and fold over evenly. Bake

rolls are good, reheated in the paper 
bags sold for cooking purposes. 

Oatmeal Biscuit 

Pour two cups of hot milk over one cup 
of uncooked oatmeal; add one-fourth a 
cup of butter or other shortening and 
one teaspoonful of salt; when cooled to a 
lukewarm temperature add a cake of 
compressed yeast, mixed through half a 
cup of lukewarm milk or water, half a 
cup of molasses and about two cups, each 
of entire wheat and white flour; beat the 
mixture about ten minutes, cover and set 
aside to become light. Cut down and 
turn into small timbale molds, or into 
muffin pans, carefully buttered. When 
nearly doubled in bulk bake about 
twenty minutes. 

Cornmeal Muffins 

Cream three tablespoonfuls of butter; 
beat in half a cup of sugar, and two eggs, 
beaten without separating; add three- 
fourths a cup of milk. Sift together one 
cup and a half of flour, three-fourths a 
cup of com meal, half a teaspoonful of 
salt and three level teaspoonfuls of bak- 
ing powder; add the liquid ingredients 
and mix thoroughly. Bake in a hot, well- 
buttered muffin pan about twenty-five 
minutes. 

Glaced Crabapples (Miss Recce) 

Select a hard, red variety of. crab- 
apples. Use only perfect fruit. For a 
peck of apples take five pounds of gran- 
ulated sugar. Wash and wipe the fruit, 
leaving on the stems if desired; put the 
fniit and sugar in stone jars or casseroles, 
in layers, adding cinnamon and cassia 
buds to taste. Cover the jars with a 
buttered paper. Bake in a slow oven two 
and one-half hours. These may be 
stored as canned fruit, but will keep in 
earthen jars some time. 



Milk Sherbet with Decoration 

Mix one cup and a half of sugar with 
the jtiice of four lemons and gradually 
beat in one quart of rich milk. Pack 
and freeze at once. Serve in glass cups 
with a cherry and a sprinkling of chopped 
pistachio nuts above. 

Slices of Orange and Lemon for 

Teas 

Cut the fruit in halves, lengthwise; 
lay flat side down on a board and with a 
sharp knife cut in exceedingly thin slices. 
Dispose these in a glass dish, in alternate 
rows, orange and lemon, each half slice 
slightly overlapping another. Fill the 
center with cubes of preserved ginger or 
pineapple. With a smaller dish, cut in 
quarter rather than half -slices. Serve a 
piece of lemon, orange and the third 
article in each cup of tea. The effect 
of the arrangement is that of a flower 
with petals, of two colors, alternating. 

Rummage Pickles 

Chop three quarts of green tomatoes, 
one quart of ripe tomatoes, three small 
bunches of celery, three large onions, 
three red peppers, three green peppers, 
one large ripe cucumber and one quart of 
small green cucumbers. Cover with 
one-third a cup of salt. Let stand over- 
night; in the morning drain well, add 
three pints of vinegar, two pounds of 
brown sugar, one teaspoonful, each, of 
mustard and pepper and one tablespoon- 
ful of cinnamon. Store cold in half -pint 
fruit jars, that only a small portion may 
be opened at once. 

Drop Cookies 

Beat two tablespoonfuls of butter to 
a cream; beat in one-fouth a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, half a cup of sugar, one well 
beaten egg, two tablespoonfuls of milk 
and one cup of sifted flour, sifted again 
with two teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
der. Drop by small teaspoofuls on a 
buttered tin; set half a pecan nut meat 
above. Bake in a quick oven.

Practical Home Dietetics 

'Diet in Uric Acid Disorders 
By Minnie Genevieve Morse 



THE process of human nutrition is 
one of the most marvelous phen- 
omena in a universe of marvels. 
Even when through carelessness or 
self-indulgence or privation the fuel sup- 
plied to the body furnace is improperly 
selected, insufficient, or too abundant, 
up to a certain point the machinery ad- 
justs itself to the abnormal conditions, 
and comparatively little harm results. 
This is especially the case in youth, when 
all the nutritive processes are carried on 
with greatest vigor; when the afternoon 
of life commences, and the physical 
powers begin to wane, adjustment to 
abnormal conditions becomes more diffi- 
cult. Unfortunately, this is the time 
when the heaviest strain is apt to be 
put upon the organs of digestion 
and elimination; the pleasures of ti.c 
tabic are usually dearest to those wlo 
are no longer bearing the heat and burden 
of the day, but are allowing themselves a 
respite from hard work and bodily 
exertion. In persons of this type, over- 
indulgence in eating and drinking, or 
anything that tends to bring about a 
further insufficiency of these or other 
organs, may result in the accumula- 
tion in the body of waste products 
which the excreting system is not able 
to carry off. 

Of these waste products, which, by 



remaining in the body in excessive quan- 
tities, may produce detrimental efTects, 
the one that probably does the most 
damage, and the one regarding which 
the public certainly hears the most, is 
uric acid. Just how an excess of uric 
acid in the system is brought about is 
not certain, but it is known to be due in 
some manner to a defect in the way the 
nitrogenous foods, and especially meats, 
are handled by the nutritive processes. 
Probably the principal causative factor 
may vary somewhat in different cases. 
Nor is the form of trouble produced by 
the excess of acid always the same. It 
may be deposited as crystals in the 
kidneys or bladder, forming renal or 
vesical calculi, popularly known as 
"gravel"; a gouty condition may appear, 
characterized by an accumulation of de- 
posits in the joints; or there may be only 
the more indefinite symptoms included 
in what is known as the litheinic state, 
among which may be mentioned various 
forms of irritation of the nervous system, 
digestive disttu-bances, headache or a 
feeling of fulness of the head, or some 
skin affection. Rheumatism was also 
formerly believed to be largely due to 
excess of uric acid in the blood, and, while 
acute rheumatism is now numbered 
among germ diseases, and an anti-uric- 
acid diet is thought to be of less import" 



URIC ACID DIvSORDERS 



221 



ance in its prevention or its treatment 
than was supposed a generation ago, 
still it is known that a premature return 
to a meat diet after an attack may induce 
a relapse. 

Special restricted diets for use in dis- 
eased conditions are much less often 
prescribed than was formerly the case, 
research having proved the futility of 
many of the dietetic methods of earlier 
days. The principle of modem dietetics 
seems to be, largely, to give in most con- 
ditions as well balanced, nourishing, and 
easily digestible a diet as is possible under 
the circumstances, treating each case to a 
considerable extent on its own merits. 
Even in chronic kidney disease, in dia- 
betes, in obesity, and in continued fev- 
ers, which are perhaps the conditions 
requiring the greatest restriction in the 
matter of food, the tendency is toward 
a less rigid and uniform regimen than for- 
merly. While certain general consider- 
ations remain in force, and must always 
do so, such as the reduction of fat-mak- 
ing foods in the obese patient's diet, and 
the cutting down of starch and sugar in 
that of the diabetic, so many circumstan- 
ces must be taken into account, in the 
case of any given person, that to lay down 
hard and fast rules for general use is 
difficult if not impossible. 

This is seldom more truly the case than 
in uric acid disorders, where the condi- 
tion of the patient's heart, blood vessels, 
kidneys, digestive organs, body weight, 
and many other circumstances may play 
their part in bringing about the situa- 
tion; and the person who has been told 
or becomes convinced that he has in his 
system an excess of this mischief -making 
element will do well to discuss the matter 
fully with a good physician, have a die- 
tetic regimen laid out for him with as 
much detail as possible, and then abide 
by it, avoiding indulgences and indis- 
cretions with great care, if he desires 
fair health and length of days. 

It may be said, however, that the gen- 
eral opinion of the medical profession is 
that the sufferer from uric acid disorders 



should avoid eating heavily of meats or 
sweets, and live largely upon farina- 
ceous foods and fresh vegetables, omit- 
ting entirely from his diet any article 
that is known to disagree with him, 
and, in most cases, all forms of alcohol. 
The red meats, which are supposed to be 
' the worst offenders, produce their evil 
effects chiefly by means of the ''extract- 
ives*' which they contain; these extract- 
ives are what give the fine flavor to the 
meat, and to beef tea and beef extract. 
Boiled meats have been found to agree 
better with patients troubled with exces- 
sive uric acid than those that have been 
roasted or fried, as the extractives are 
pretty well removed by boiling. It does 
not do to reduce the proportion of nitro- 
genous food allowed to a patient too 
greatly, as a sufficient amount is required 
by the body to compensate for the con- 
stant combustion of such material that 
goes on as long as life continues. Even 
in health, however, far less is needed in 
mature life than during the period of 
growth, and less again by those who lead 
a sedentary life than by those engaged in 
active physical work. Moreover, nitro- 
gen may be supplied to the system in 
other forms than meat, foods of this class 
including also eggs, milk, cheese, fish, 
poultry, nuts, and some of the vegetables 
and grains. Most mature Americans of 
the well-to-do classes are heavy meat 
eaters, and it would be well for the health 
of this and future generations, if the pres- 
ent almost prohibitive prices of the good 
cuts of meat might lead to a general de- 
crease in the use of this sort of food. At 
all events, the person showing signs of 
uric acid disorder will make no mistake 
in cutting down the quantity of meat he 
eats to a small portion once a day, and 
avoiding all dishes in the preparation of 
which meat extracts are used. Espe- 
cially is this important in cases where 
there may be the slightest suspicion of 
any weakness of the kidneys, which are 
the principal excreting organs of the 
body, and which too often make no sign 
of their inadequacy until the situation 



222 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



is beyond remedy. 

The reason for restricting the amount 
of sugar eaten ii uric acid disorders is 
that the taking of foods sweetened with 
cane sugar has a tendency to retard the 
digestion of porteid (or nitrogenous) 
foods, which, of course, makes the meat 
eaten by an individual an even greater 
menace to his well-being than it would 
otherwise be. As sweets stand only 
second to meats in popular favor, re- 
striction along this line also may involve 
considerable self-denial . * ' Dieting means 
going without everything you like," 
complained a patient with a fondness for 
good living; and too many such people 
come to the conclusion that the game is 
not worth the candle, return to their 
self-indulgent habits, and pay a heavy 
penalty in impaired health and suffering. 

If the housewife whose household con- 
tains a person showing signs of uric acid 
disorder will plan her daily menu so as 
to use as little meat as possible, and will 
make a practice of using fruit for dessert 
or of substituting a salad for the usual 
sweet course, she will not only make the 
patient feel his restrictions less, but wiU 
lay a foundation for better health on the 
part of the rest of her family. Not 
only may she use poultry, game, fish or 
shell fish for the piece de resistance of a 
meal, but modern cook books and domes- 
tic magazines will furnish her with num- 
berless suggestions for "dishes with meat 
value,'* which may serve as occasional 
substitutes. Fried foods and rich made 
dishes, however, being difficult of diges- 
tion even for the healthy, should not be 
given to patients with uric acid troubles, 
even for the sake of varying a restricted 
diet. 

A good nourishing soup may well form 
a substantial part of the dinner menu, 
requiring less of a hearty sort to follow 
it than the few spoonfuls of light bouillon 
or consomme which does little beyond 
exciting the digestive fluids to greater 
action. Such soups should not contain 
much fat, and are better made from vege- 
tables, fresh fish, oysters, clams, or 



chicken, than from meat. Cream soups 
are especially valuable in cases where the 
taking of considerable milk is recom- 
mended. 

In summer, when fresh vegetables are 
cheap and abundant, there need be little 
difficulty in varying the bill of fare, as 
there is seldom much restriction along 
this line, and vegetable dishes are accept- 
able to almost everyone. During the 
winter, although the variety is less, it is 
well to have vegetables play as large a 
part as possible in the menu, and those 
staple canned articles that are known 
to be packed by a reliable house may be 
used to supplement the resources of the 
market. A few vegetables, however, are 
frequently forbidden to the uric acid 
sufferer, chiefly because they contain 
oxalic acid, which is nearly related to 
uric acid ; among these are rhubarb, aspa- 
ragus, and tomatoes, all of which, unfor- 
tunately, are very popular members of 
the vegetable kingdom. Sweet potatoes 
and mushrooms are also often found on 
the forbidden list. 

With regard to the use of fruit in excess 
of uric acid, authorities differ consider- 
ably, but nearly all agree in allowing 
apples, pears, and peaches, raw or cooked 
and oranges and pineapples, and in for- 
bidding such acid fruits as strawberries, 
which will often, even when taken in the 
most moderate quantity, precipitate an 
attack in a gouty patient. Fruits con- 
taining large quantities of sugar, such as 
grapes, prunes, and figs, are usually pro- 
hibited, and all cooked fruits are gener- 
ally directed to be prepared without su- 
gar, as sugar combined, with fruit acids 
undergoes in the digestive canal a fer- 
mentative process that is considered to 
have injurious effects. Dried fruits 
should not be used in the diet of these 
patients. 

Farinaceous foods may in a large pro- 
portion of cases of uric acid disorder form 
a very considerable part of the diet. 
Cereals of almost all kinds may be al- 
lowed, and the eating of bread, when not 
too fresh, and especially graham, rye, 



DIET IN URIC ACID DISORDERS 



223 



or whole wheat bread or rolls, is seldom 
much restricted in uncomplicated cases. 
Crackers of the unsweetened varieties, 
macaroni and spagetti, rice and com 
meal, diy and milk toast all come under 
the head of farinaceous foods, and are 
wholesome and nourishing. 

If su^ar is diiected to be almost entiiely 
cn.itted from the diet, and yet the patient 
has a craving for sweet desserts, simple 
milk puddings, blanc-mange, and jellies, 
sweetened with saccharin or sweetina, 
substances derived from coal tar and 
many times sweeter than any form of 
sugar, are usually permitted. Honey 
and milk sugar are considered less injur- 
ious than cane sugar. 

Champagne, sweet wines, liquors of all 
kinds, and even cider are held to be mis- 
chievous when admitted to the diet of a 
person with uric acid trouble, and the 
use of any form of alcohol is generally 
strictly prohibited, except in cases of 
elderly or debilitated patients for whom 
stimtdation is absolutely necessary, when 
whiskey is most often ordered. Many 
authorities forbid the use of coffee or 
cocoa, but allow weak tea, if taken with- 
out sugar. Unlimited milk is usually 
allowed, unless it is known to disagree 
with an individual; malted milk is agree- 
able and nourishing, and buttermilk, 
which is supposed to exert a particularly 
beneficial effect on intestinal digestion, 
is high in favor with the medical pro- 
fession. Cereal coffee is harmless, if 
taken without sugar, and toast water, 
hot or cold, is agreeable to some people. 
Many persons drink far too little water, 
and very few drink it to excess, except 
those who wash down the half -masticated 
solids of their meals with glass after glass 
of iced water, chilling the stomach and 
further retarding digestion by over- 
diluting the gastric fluids. While the 
modem view of drinking at meals re- 
gards the taking of a reasonable amount 
of fluid as non-injurious, indulgence in 
large quantities, and especially when ice- 
cold, is unquestionably contrary to the 
laws of health. Plenty of pure water 



taken between meals, however, is neces- 
sary, in order to keep the system well 
flushed out. The object sought in drink- 
ing the alkaline waters so largely used 
by gouty and lithemic patients is the 
counteraction in some degree of the 
over-acid reaction of the blood. Vichy, 
Londonderry, and Buffalo Lithia waters 
are frequently recommended; but it is 
probable that the benefit derived from 
them is to a considerable degree that of 
drinking a pure water, as the amount of 
lithium they contain is so small that a 
great quantity of water would have to 
be taken to introduce an appreciable 
amoimt of it into the system, A more 
decided result along this line is obtained 
by using the effervescent lithium tablets 
which are sold by all pharmacists, and 
which may be added to a glass of water 
and taken as required. 

As has already been intimated, it is a 
dangerous procedure for a person suffer- 
ing from excess of uric acid in the sys- 
tem to attempt to treat himself. A 
hundred different conditions may exist, 
involving entirely different indications 
for treatment. For example, if obesity 
is present, eating a large amotint of fat- 
producing vegetables and farinaceous 
foods is not to be recommended, and the 
diet must be modified accordingly. If 
there is a tendency to diabetes, — and of 
this the patient cannot judge for him- 
self, — starchy foods must be largely 
eliminated from the menu. 

When a man's automobile shows signs 
of weakness somewhere, he loses no time 
in having it looked over by a man 
skilled in such work, and if he is wise 
he will realize that sjmiptoms of wear 
and tear or of disorder in his bodily 
machinery call loudly for the same 
expert attention, ignorant attempts to 
deal with the situation being as provoca- 
tive of disaster in the one case as 
in the other. When a person comes 
of a gouty, rheumatic, or lithemic fam- 
ily, however, he may himself do much to 
avert, his own day of trouble, by mod- 
eration in eating and drinking.

My "Company" Salad Dressing 

THE telephone bell rang insistently, 
and as I hastened to pick up the 
receiver I recognized a note of anxiety 
in a voice familiar to me. 

"Oh, Marion, is that you? You were 
so long coming to the 'phone I was afraid 
you were out. I'm in an awful dilem- 
ma — help me, please. There's not an 
egg to be had around here, and Will's 
mother is coming to lunch — oh, don't 
laugh,— it's really serious. How can I 
put a ready-made mayonnaise on my 
salad? You know how opposed she is 
to eating anything not strictly home- 
made, and she will be sure to ask me if 
I made the dressing. What am I to do? 
You can't make mayonnaise without 
eggs, can you?" 

"Not mayonnaise — " said I, prompt- 
ly. "But, Ruth, I seldom, in fact, never, 
since my trip abroad, use a mayonnaise 
dressing on anything — " 

"Ob. I know," interrupted Ruth, a 
little excitedly, "You do make delicious 
French dressings, but I never have any 
luck with them. I have tried different 
ways — using the egg-beater, or a silver 
fork, and either I don't get the ingre- 
dients chilled just right or something 
is the matter, for it never gets smooth. 
I'm afraid to try that." 

"Listen, Ruth," I tried to be patient 
with this friend of mine who was always 
excited when her in-laws came to dine. 

"There is nothing nicer than a French 
dressing. When properly made it has a 



subtle, epicurean taste which places a 
mayonnaise almost in the plebian class. 
Have you some good — really first-class 
olive oil? Fine! Put four tablespoon- 
fuls in a bottle. A small — about half- 
pint bottle is a good size — yes, a BOT- 
TLE, I know what I am talking about, 
don't interrupt me till I've finished. 
Then add one tablespoonful of the verj' 
best vinegar; spiced, if you can get it, 
is fine. And half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and a dash of something — paprika, I 
often use. Of course, if your vinegar is 
spiced, you may omit that. Now Ruth, 
cork your bottle tightly and shake! 
That's all. Your dressing is made. 
Yes, it's the way I always do, and I keep 
the one bottle for the purpose, and as it 
is an expensive little thing which came 
originally from abroad with some for- 
eign decoction in, I have no compunc- 
tions at all about putting it right on the 
table. We like to dress our own salad. 
"That's all, my dear. Now get your 
lettuce hearts and a couple of sound, 
ripe tomatoes, with some chopped celery 
or part of a green pepper, both for looks 
and taste, and you'll have a salad that 
will tempt the palate of not only.mother- 
in-laws, but any chance visitor who may 
happen in. Good-by and good-luck!" 



Eating Or Dining? 

TO-DAY Lucia came to me all aglow 
with an important discovery to 
impart: "Can it be that it is only in 



HOME IDEAS AND ECONOMIES 



225 



our own family and at our own table 
that our mental differences are so plainly 
accentuated and set forth?** 

** Where were you last night,** I asked 
with the privilege of an old acquaintance, 
''did you take dinner at Laidley*s?" 

''Well," she replied with a smile, "I 
cannot say that I took dinner or that I 
merely ate with them, for I realize that 
it was more than just eating, it was din- 
ing in the fullest sense of the word. 
For 'there's a difference.' ** 

"That sounds interesting,** I inter- 
posed, "come, tell me more about this 
eating or dining, rather.** 

"Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I consider 
that one cannot be said to dine when the 
tablecloth is crooked, and the centerpiece 
not above reproach, and no flowers, not 
even a tiny bunch of them, and everyone 
of the family talking their own hobby at 
table, as it is at home. My brothers 
talk athletics, and the feminine members 
talk dress, mostly; father is usually silent, 
and we never seem to have one thought 
in common as a -family. If I start to tell 
an anecdote, that I think might be an 
agreeable change, nobody listens, or I 
find that they have raced through the 
meal and are leaving the table.** 

"Well, last night at Laidley*s every- 
thing was different; the table was well- 
ordered and appointed, though I, as 
Margaret's friend, was the only guest, 
and we had a leisurely meal with a little 
interesting conversation thrown in as a 
side dish as it were ; everything said was 
good and every member of the family 
took an intelligent part in whatever was 
being discussed, and every one who spoke 
was given attention and consideration by 
the others. Now I know why I am not 
as clever as Margaret at repartee, and 
why she knows so much of political ques- 
tions and impersonal problems. Her 
father is a member of the council, and 
when he and her brother discussed civic 
measure, everyone listened or gave an 
opinion. Do you know that I left 
there quite envious, but determined that, 
if ever I have a home in which I am the 



presiding genius, I will never let meal 
time, especially the last meal of the day 
degenerate into anything as material and 
meaningless, as it is in my present house- 
hold. At my table there shall be food 
for the mind as well as for the body; we 
shall dine in the fullest sense of the word, 
and shall meet upon the common level 
of an interchange of thought upon some 
interesting and worth-while subject. 

"Sermons in dishes,** I laughed in 
answer. But, none the less, I felt that 
my friend had learned something highly 
important. I doubt if any habit of our 
-lives is as influential for our immediate 
happiness as well as for our future devel- 
opment as the tone and subject of our 
daily conversation at meals. 

What an important item is the subject 
for discussion 365 days in a year; bow 
beneficial or how deteriorating may be 
the effect upon the mind of young per- 
sons, be they members of the family or 
chance guests. For the rarity of good 
talk is perhaps nowhere so conspicuously 
emphasized as at dinner, be it a formal 
affair or a family gathering. 

Few are the leaders who regard the 
occasion as other than a gastronomic or 
a sartorial display, to be seasoned if pos- 
sible with enough of light talk to impart 
an air of gayety to the function. The 
mind, it would seem, were a neglegible 
quality, not worthy of consideration. 

Why should not preparations, on the 
part of the dinner giver, — housekeeper 
or hostess, include thought as to what 
shall be said? One need not attempt to 
give the occasion a conversazione com- 
plexion but merely arrange that the talk 
shall be generally interesting and enter- 
taining. One need not eliminate origin- 
ality, which is spontaneous, but the well- 
informed and tactful hostess not only can 
appear to good conversational advantage, 
but she can, by giving thought to the 
matter, make each guest yield the best 
of which he or she is capable for the en- 
tertainment of the company. 

As at present exhibited in social life, 
table conversation is at low water mark.

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



Formerly a social gathering, such as a 
dinner, was always held in the giver's 
own home, where the owner's personal 
tastes, as lepresented in his books, pic- 
tures, and hobbies, gave the keynote for 
subjects of converse, or suggested appro- 
priate themes. Now the scene often 
shifts to the hotel and rented scenery, 
which is not conducive to a feast of rea- 
son and flow of soul. At least, this is 
true of mixed social gatherings. Men's 
dinners usually have some attic salt 
with which to season the dishes. But 
to have the real and piquant quality, it 
takes the virile and strong ideas of the 
man, coping with the tact and imagina- 
tion of a clever woman to produce the 
finest flower of conversation. 

The art of good table talk needs for its 
best expression, well-directed knowledge 
gained from books and life, lucidity of 
statement, a fine sense of htmior, imagin- 
ation, and a well-modulated and clear 
voice. These acquirements should be 
upheld as desirable, and made an object 
of ambition, instead of being wholly ig- 
nored. The time and place to begin to 
assume these accomplishments is in the 
home and at the family table. Then, 
indeed, we may dine happily, a great ad- 
vancement over ordinary eating.

Boneless Bass Easy 

ALTHOUGH the streams of Mary- 
land are not over-laden with mon- 
ster bass, its housewives have dis- 
covered a trick in preparing that lus- 
cious fish that robs it of its greatest 
terror — bones. No one need hesitate 
at enjoying the fish because of them, if 
the cook be possessed of the proper re- 
cipe. Says one Maryland authority, — 
"Every bone should and can be taken 
out of a bass before it is fried. The 
proper way is to lay the bass on a board 
and scrape off all the scales. Then run 
a sharp knife all along the back on both 
sides close to the fin. Catch the fin at 
the tail and pull it out and it will rip up 



all along the back and out will come all 
those fin bones. 

"It is just as easy to take out the back- 
bone and ribs. Run the knife along, 
right on the ribs, and you can lift the 
meat right off and there you have the 
fish in halves without any bones in it. 
Cut these halves, each, in two or three 
places, wash them in cool water, salt 
and roll in floiu* and com meal. Use 
crackers, if you want a heavier crust. 
Good butter, not old, and fresh bacon 
fat should be used for frying the fish. 
Grease the skillet when it is smoking hot 
and lay in your fish. Don't turn over 
your pieces. Turn the skillet around by 
the handle, thus keeping the meat mov- 
ing right around the fat. And you will 
have a royal dish." c. ^. c.

No More Ants 

HAVE you been bothered with ants? 
Measly, little, red ones that get 
into your cupboard, ice-box and various 
places where you simply cannot have 
them? 

Try this: It is one of a dozen "sure- 
cures" which came to me well recom- 
mended, and absolutely the only one 
which had the necessary effect. 

Get five cents worth of Tartar Emelie 
from your druggist. Mix a little of 
this with about one-fourth as much 
sugar and add a few drops of water. 
Stir this with a match or tooth-pick until 
well mixed. Be careful not to use too 
much water. A very thick paste is best. 
Put drops of this where the ants are, 
also make "runs" where they will find 
them. 

A good plan is to find where they enter 
the house. A little watching will show 
this. You will find that they come and

Query 2059. — "Recipe with explicit direc- 
tions for making and rolling a 'Jelly Roll." 

Jelly Roll 



3 eggs 

1 1 cups of sugar 
Grated rind of 1 lemon 
1 tablespoonful of lemon 

juice 
i a cup of cold water 



1 J cups of flour 

i a teaspoonful of 

soda 
1 slightly rounding 

teaspoonful of cream 

of-tartar 



Beat the eggs; gradually beat in the 
sugar, and grated rind, then add the flour 
with soda and cream-of-tartar, alter- 
nately, with the water. Bake in a but- 
tered shallow pan; turn upside down 
upon a cloth and trim off the four sides 
(these are crusty and break in rolling . 
Have ready a tumbler of jelly beaten 
quite smooth with a silver fork. Spread 
the jelly over the cake, then, keeping the 
cloth between the fingers and the cake, 
roll the cake over and over having the 
cloth against the whole width of the cake 
will keep the cake from cracking while 
rolling). At last roll the cake in the 
cloth. The pan must be of good size 
that the sheet of cake be thin. 



Query 2060. — "How may Parsley be kept 
fresh after it has been brought from market?" 

Keeping Parsley 

Parsley may be kept a long time in a 
glass of water in the same manner as cut 
flowers are kept. Change the water each 
day and occasionally clip the ends of the 
stems. A subscriber suggests keeping 
lettuce and parsley in a cheese-cloth bag 
near the ice; this does very well but the 



glass of water set in the ice-chest is more 
satisfactory. Parsley may be kept a 
week or more without water, in the re- 
frigerator, in a closed receptacle that 
excludes air. 



Query 2061. — "Recipe for Lady Fingers." 

Lady Fingers 

lemon 



3 eggs 

J a cup of sugar 

Grated rind of i a 



f a cup of flour 



Beat the yolks thick, and the whites 
dry; add lemon rind to yolks, and beat in 
the sugar gradually; fold in half the 
whites, half the flour, the other half of 
the whites and the rest of the flour. 
Shape on a buttered baking sheet, in nar- 
row strips, about one inch wide and four 
or five inches long and dredge with 
sugar. Bake about ten minutes. 



Query 2062.— "Recipe for Dill Pickles." 

Dill Pickles 

As far as we know Dill pickles are 
made as any pickles save that branches 
of dill are laid in between the layers of 
pickles to give them flavor. If these 
pickles are made by a process of fermen- 
tation similar to that employed for sauer 
krout, will some reader kindly supply a 
recipe? 



Query 2063. — "Desserts without sugar. What 
Soups are best for an individual unable to eat 
sugar?" 



m 



228 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



Soups for Sugar- free Diet 

Clam broth, boiiillon, meat broths, 
consomm6, or cream soups, made of 
starch-free vegetables, thickened with 
gluten flour. Among the cream soups 
allowable would be asparagus, spinach, 
celery, tomato, cabbage, lettuce and 
string bean. 

Desserts Free of Sugar 

Custards, jellies. Bavarian Cream and 
similar desserts may be made as usual by 
using Sweetina in place of sugar. 



Query 2064. — "What differences are occa- 
sioned in bread by the use of milk and of water 
as ingredients?" 

Differences in Milk arid Water 

Bread 

Bread made with milk is more nutri- 
tious than bread made with water. 
Bread made with water and no shorten- 
ing, well kneaded, gives French bread. 
This is a rather porous bread with tough 
flinty crust; such bread is sometimes 
called true bread, and bread made with 
milk and shortening a variety of cake. 
Bread made with milk, or half milk and 
half water, is thought to remain moist 
and in good condition longer than bread 
made with water. 



Query 2065. — "Reciiies for Strawberry Jam 
and Strawrbery Jelly." 

Strawberry Jam 

For each pound of berries take three- 
fourths a pound of sugar. Put the ber- 
ries, carefiilly hulled, washed, and drained, 
over the fire. Let heat slowly till they 
are softened throughout. If eight quarts 
or more are to be made, pour off a pint of 
juice and can for some other use. Break 
up the berries with a slitted wooden 
spoon, then add the sugar and let cook 
until thick. Store either as canned fruit 
or as jelly. 

Strawberry Jelly 

Apples or currants should be added to 



strawberries, if a satisfactory jelly is to 
be made. As apples are not in season in 
strawberry time, it is best to can the 
strawberry jtiice without sugar and make 
up the jelly when apples are plenty. 
Prepare the apple juice in the usual man- 
ner. Use one pint of strawberry juice 
to three pints of apple juice and three- 
fourths a cup of sugar to each cup of 
fruit juice. Cook the apple and straw- 
berry juice together about fifteen min- 
utes; add the sugar made hot on plates in 
the oven, cook two or three minutes 
longer or to 218° F. by the sugar ther- 
mometer. Have the glasses on a cloth in 
a pan of hot water. Fill the glasses at 
once. Skim during the cooking as 
needed. Raspberries may be used in the 
same manner. 



Query 2066. — "Sauce for Broiled Live Lob- 
ster; it looks like melted butter, but there seem 
to be other ingredients in it." 

Sauce for Broiled Live Lobster 

Melted butter without other ingredi- 
ents is often used. At other times lemon 
juice, paprika, chopped parsley, etc., are 
added. 



1 cup of thick sour 
milk 

2 eggs 



Query 2067.— "Why do Waffles made with 
sour or buttermilk lack crispness? Recipe for 
Waffles." 

Waffles with Sour or Buttermilk 

1 i cups of flour 

i a teaspoonful of salt 

\ a teaspoonful of soda 

4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter 

Sift together the dry ingredients; add 
the yolks of the eggs, beaten and mixed 
with the sour milk, and the melted but- 
ter; mix all together thoroughly, then 
fold in the whites of the eggs, beaten dry. 
Rich milk (butter fat) and shortening 
make waffles crisp.

scalded-and-cooled milk, into which two 
tablespoonfuls of butter have been 
melted. Add also half a teaspoonful of 
salt and one cup and a half of sifted 
bread flour. Beat the above mixture un- 
til it is very smooth. Then cover, and 
set to rise. When the sponge is light, 
beat into it about two cups, or two and 
one-fourth cups, of flour, continuing the 
beating some few minutes (eight or ten), 
to make a tough batter. Cover, and let 
stand until again light. The mixture is 
now ready to use, or it may be cut down, 
covered, and set into the refrigerator un- 
til morning. When ready to bake, cut 
the dough into twenty-four pieces. 
Knead these with floured hands or on a 
well-floured board (the dough is rather 
soft). Then pat them to the size of the 
rings. Have the board well -floured, and 
the muffin rings well-buttered. Put the 
rings on the board and the dough in the 
rings, and cover close with a pan or 
cloth. When the dough a little more 
than half fills the rings, remove the rings, 
and dough with a spatula to a well- 
heated and buttered griddle. Keep the 
griddle of uniform heat, and, when the 
muffins are baked on one side, turn muf- 
fins and rings, and bake the other side. 
When the muffins are baked, cut through 
the crust, then tear apart wdth the fingers 
(as a cracker is split), and toast the 
halves over a bed of coals. Spread the 
rough side with butter as soon as toasted, 
and serve at once. The muffin rings 
ised for this recipe were two and three- 
fourths inches in diameter. Rings of a 
larger size may be used. Toasted muffin 
are served with marmalade and tea as a 
light lunch, or with a green vegetable 
salad and cheese as a salad course. 



Query 2069. — "Recipes for Spiced Peaches 
and Candied Orange Peel." 

Spiced Peaches 



7 lbs. of peaches 
5 lbs. of sugar 
1 pint of vinegar 



1 cup of water 
I a cup of stick cinna- 
mon 
J a cup of whole cloves 



Have ready a syrup, made of the sugar, 
vinegar and water, add the spices, then 
add a few of the peaches with one or 
two cloves pressed into each; let cook a 
moment, turning the peaches if necessary 
to soften all sides. Set the peaches in 
fruit jars. When all are cooked reduce 
the syrup and with it fill the jars to over- 
flow. Close the jars as in canning fruit. 

Candied Orange Peel 

Cut the peel, removed from the fruit 
in quarter sections; in strips of uniform 
thickness. Let cook in boiling water 
until very tender. Set aside until the 
next day. Take the original weight of 
the peel in sugar with enough water from 
the peel to dissolve it (half its weight). 
Boil and skim; add the peel and let 
cook until the syrup is nearly absorbed; 
pick out the strips of peel and roll them, 
while hot, one by one, in granulated 
sugar. Let dry on table oil cloth 



Query 2070. — *'Recipes for *Mixing Mustard 
similar to the prepared mustard sold in bottles/* 
and for "baking beans with tomato sauce.'* 

Bottled Mustard 

To half a cup of powdered mustard 
add one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt and 
half a teaspoonful of sugar, then stir to 
a thick paste with boiUng water. For 
French mustard, use vinegar seasoned 
with shallot, trarragon or garlic, in the 
place of the water. The above are gen- 
eral rules. Dealers putting up such 
specialities have formulas for the same 
that are not divulged to the.consimier. 

Beans Baked with Tomato Sauce 

Use your usual formula for baking 
beans, the one for Boston Baked Beans 
being preferred, then, when occasion 
arises for replenishing the liquid, add, 
each time, a cup of tomato puree or a 
cup of ordinary tomato sauce. 



Remove the skins from the peaches.

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



Most college boys eat meat too freely ; 
meat once a day will suifice At a home 
table it ought not to be a difficult matter 
to feed a college boy properly; a boy 
away from home often eats meat as the 
only food that is cooked satisfactorily. 
The menus for a week in each months as 
given each month in our pages, are well 
suited to the needs of college boys. Cer- 
eals, fruit, eggs, fish, bacon, bread and 
rolls for breakfast, meat, vegetables and 
a sweet for dinner; with soup, salad, 
bread, cooked fruit at supper will fur- 
nish the needed food principles and give 
a reasonable variety.

pan. Bake about fifteen minutes. The 
spices may be omitted. 



Query 2072 — "What nuts may be used to re- 
place meat in the dietary?" 

Nuts for Meat 

Nuts and fruit are often spoken of as 
the natural diet, but to eat nuts freely 
without digestive disturbance, the teeth 
and digestive organs must be in a per- 
fectly normal condition. Nuts rich in 
fat and protein — as almonds, Brazil 
nuts, hazel nuts, walnuts and pine ker- 
nels, wotdd take the place of meat, while 
chestnuts would replace bread and pota- 
tato or other starchy food. Nuts, eaten 
in quantity, should be ground in a mill 
or pounded in a mortar, and those not 
accustomed to eating them should begin 
with the varieties that seem to agree 
with them best. After a time, other var- 
ieties may be tried.

Query 2074. — "V'iscogen prepared by the re- 
cipe given in the magazine works successfully, 
why does its use render the whipping of cream 
such a simple matter?" 

Viscogen and Thin Cream 

That cream may be beaten to a light, 
fluffy texture, it must be of a certain 
density; by adding sugar of lime (or 
viscogen) to thin cream, its density is 
increased. 



Query 2075. — "Recipe for an inexpensive but 
delicate soup to be served in bouillon cups at a 
luncheon of ten covers." 

Kornlet Soup 

In a double boiler, set to cook one 
quart of milk, one cup of Kornlet, half 
an onion with four or five cloves pressed 
into it, three branches of parsley and 
half a teaspoonful of paprika. When 
hot stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
smoothed in a little milk; stir constantly 
a few minutes, then cover and let cook 
twenty minutes; remove the onion and 
parsley and press the remainder thru' a 
fine sieve. In the meantime, cook two 
cups of tomato and a teaspoonful of 
sugar and press thru a sieve. If for 
comj^any, this much can be done early 
in the morning. When ready to serve, 
re-heat each mixture separately, adding 
salt as needed, then pour the two mix- 
tures together and serve in cups with a

canning fruit; having sterilized the jars 
before packing in the cuctmibers, the 
pickles will then keep indefinitely. For 
a greener pickle, put grape or cabbage

Some New Ways of Serving 



By Kate Hudson 



THOUGH the German house-mother 
may pay less attention to the 
latest cry in clothes and personal 
ladormnents than does her American sis- 
•ter, she manages to follow very closely 
tthe ever-changing fashions in garnishing 
tend serving what she sets before her 
igueste. Tomatoes appear, just now, to 
Iw largely used in garnishing fish and 
toasts and for holding all sorts of unus- 
ual hors-d'oeuvres The newest one of 
the latter is — according to a noted Ber- 
lin hostess who is also a notable house- 
keeper — caviar filled into cups com- 
posed of large tomatoes of uniform size 
and color thoroughly chilled; as is the 
"Beluga," which is either heaped high 
above the tomatoes' rim or flattened 
down with a cover formed of the tomato 
bottom with a bit of stem for handle. 




When the fish-course consists of fillets- 
de-sole or other fillets these, lightly rolled 
in scrolls, are also served standing erect 
in large tomato cups, covered with 
sauce — Hollandaise, and crowned with 
two shrimps crossed; and where larger 
fish is served whole it is placed close to 
one rim of the platter to admit of its 
other half holding the fish's correspond- 
ing bulk outUned with small "sea-fruit," 
as mussels, prawns or shrimps and filled 
in with small tomatoes holdit^ minced 
trufi^es. Another very popular gar- 
nishing for pickerel or salmon — also 
flllit^ up the space on the platter oppo- 
site the fish — are cucumbers hollowed 
out into boats filled with caviar; or a 
double line of hard-boiled eggs, standing 
upright, each egg belted with a "ring" 
cut from a big tomato. 

Roast meats particulariy that German 
and Austrian favorite, roast veal, are 
frequently surrounded with tomato cups 
filled with green peas, and even with 
fine-sliced carrot Uberally topped with 
the parsley, with which in Germany the 
latter vegetable is always prepared. 



The little daughter of a prominent 
divine, whom it would be cruel to 
name, was recently taken to her father's 
churdi for the first time. She was, 
of course, intensely interested in all 
that went on. A true little Yankee, 
her first remark to her mother on 
coming out was, "Do all those Uttle 
boys in nighties get paid for singing?" 
"Yes, I suppose so," repUed her mother. 
"And does father get paid, too?" 
"Yes." Well, I shouldn't think they'd 
have to pay him much, for he does 
nothing but talk, and he just loves 
to do that." 



In every kitchen the first thing to be 
regarded is health.

MRS. SARAH TYSON RORER has juat pre-

many unique and delectable dishes, and other infor- 
mation of value to those interested in good cooking. 

This new book of Mrs. Rorer's will be sent

your name and address on a postcard to Depart- 
ment H-5, Mcllhenny Company, Drexel Building, 
Philadelphia, Pa. 

Of course the prime purpose of this new 
recipe book is to attract more favorable attention 
to our Tabasco Sauce, and to promote its use more 
widely instead of dry pepper as a seasoning for all 
dishes requiring pepper. 

It is now generally admitted among cookery 
experts that pure, unadulterated liquid Tabasco 
pepper is far stiperior to cayenne or black pepper 
because of intense seasoning power, delicious 
flavor and wholesomeness. 

Mcllhenny's Tabasco Sauce is the original and 
only genuine liquid Tabasco pepper, and is being 
used to great advantage by famous chefs and good 
housekeepers throughout the civilized world. 

It is more wholesome and a better seasoning 
than cayenne or black pepper, and makes a most 
delightful table sauce.

don't forget to send for Mrs. Rorer's new recipe 
book.

put oS the task as long as she could, 
but she really must, she knew, set about 
applying for a school now. 

At least, one afternoon, with a sort of 
Latimer and Ridly expression, as Ted 
diagnozed it, on her face, she had col- 
lected her courage, some paper, en- 
velopes, and several school clerk's 
addresses, and was grimly preparing 
to convince them of the peculiar adap- 
tability of her talents for their several 
schools, wlen the Postman's whistle 
came like a welcome summons. 

Everybody tumbled out of the house, 
and somebody seized the budget, and 
bore it in, in triumph. 

"Nan, that's partiality," Ted 
grumbled, "I believe you're Uncle Sam's 
favorite niece. "Whew — here's a busi- 
ness-like envelope." 

"The Homemaker," her mother 
glanced at the comer of the envelope. 
"Why— Nan— it's too thin to be — Oh, 
do you think — " 

"Oh, no," said Nan hastily, "it's only 
some notice or other, of course. She 
pulled out a slender blue slip of paper, 
then stared at it with a dazed expression 
in her eyes. 

"Mother, take it, and see what it 
says. I can't be seeing straight. Oh, 
quick!" her voice shook. 

Everybody clambered to look over 
Mother's shoulder. 

"Pay to the order of — " began Ted. 

"Three himdred dollars," shouted 
Keimeth. 

"Oh, Nan!" Lollipops flew at her. 

"You've won, dear," her mother was 
smiling at her, proudly. 

Nan's eyes shone. College, college, 
the check seemed to chant joyously at 
her. C 

She opened her lips to speak. But in 
that instant came a piercing odor from 
the kitchen, and the check fluttered 
uimoticed to the floor. 

"The beans are burning," cried Nan, 
and vanished through the door.

A CALIFORNIA tourist whom I 
know, bfought home a jar of 
pickled figs, guava jelly and other things 
for the sole purpose of giving a unique 
party, and it certainly was an interesting 
function. It may be given by ladies 
lately returned from California or be

have just returned from the land of sun< 
shine and flowers, A novel gathering 
would be an entire company of people 
who had visited California. 

The decorations may be a blending of

blankets make splendid rugs, as well as 
couch covers; smaller bits of woven 
pieces for stand covers or pillow tops 
are nice, and Spanish fl^s should wave 
along with the Stars and Stripes. Large 
Indian jars, if procurable, should hold 
sprays of the yellow mustard or yellow 
flowered musk and red geraniums, and 
carnations should stand in brown earthen 
ollas. Flowery June is a favorable month 
to get plenty of greenery for making a 
bower of a porch. It might be arranged 
somethii^ after the porch on Camulc>s 
ranch, Ramona's early home. Many sou- 
venirs of the trip may be utilized either 
here or on the table, which should show 
doilies and elaborate centerpiece of 
drawn work. 

A bowl of the golden California poppy, 
resting on the beautiful webltke lace, 
makes a gorgeous center. 

The place-cards may be water colors 
of the dainty wild flowers of the state, 
or tiny Indian sketches, or better still, 
thin orange wood cards bearing a pic- 
ture of the Camulos ranch house. 

Small dishes of pottery may hold the 
nuts and bonbons, which are in appro- 
priate colors ; these later may be given 
as favors. Abalone shells so highly pol- 
ished make beautiful receptacles for can- 
died fruit and jelly. 

It adds, if a guitar player can be se- 
cured to play during refreshments, or 
if a musical friend will sing several 
Spanish love songs. A very desirable

Verse of the Vegetable Vendor 

Through the lanei and alleyi narrow 
Trudges he with brimming barrow, 

Where leaf-filtered sun streams down 
On the streets of Trenton town. 



"Won't you buy my red tomatoes. 
Corn and carrots and potatoes. 

Fresh and fancyl If you're wise 
You will use their ears and eyes. 

When for cabbages you're paying 
Don't forget this wise old saying; 

('Tis a truth, though said in fun — } 
Two heads better are than one. 

Some onions purchased at the start 
Might serve, perhaps, to make yon smart; 

My melons all are fine and sweet, — 
My mustard greens cannot be beet 

Try this big, late-blooming posy. 

Tastier than a scented rosy. 
Queen of all my garden bower — 

This blossom is the canliflowerl" 

Thus he sauntereth and singetfa. 
And reluctant coin he wring eth 

From the housewives, up and down. 
Throughout peaceful Trenton town.

It happened in Toronto, 

Scene, the First Precinct Police- 
Station. DriscoU was making out his 
report. He began two or three times, 
and tore up the paper and started afresh. 

"What are you workin' at?" said the 
man at the desk. "Writing a letter?" 

"Naw !" said Driscoll. "There b a 
dead horse over on Cholmondelay Street, 
and Rule Seventeen says I have to re- 
port it in writing." 

And Driscoll chewed the end of the 
penholder, groaned and leaned over the 
desk like a cuttlefish seeking its prey. 

"How do you spell it, anyway?" said 
Driscoll. 

"What?" 

"Cholmondelay Street." 

"Well, the same old way," answered 
the man at the desk. 

Pretty soon Driscoll threw down the 
pen, got up and put on his uniform. 

As he went out of the door, the desk- 
man called, "Where are you goin', Dris- 
coll?" 

"I'm goin' to drag that dead horse 
around the comer into King Street l"

Appreciation 
The Boston Cooking School Mag. Co., 

Thank you for the sample of a perfect 
cooking magazine. I am a woman just 
past her 75th birthday, a graduate of 
Boston University School of Medicine, 
who has practiced her profession over 
30 years in Chicago, and who was bom 
of a mother who believed in generous 
and proper feeding, — all this to vouch 
for my opinion of the magazine being 
worthy of consideration. Now I am Uv- 
ing a sane life in this perfect climate, in 
a pocket of these beautiful mountains, 
but I am still talking cooking enthusiasti- 
cally. I have felt very certain for years, 
that if the world were always properly 
fed there would be an end to Tuberculo- 
sis, and there would have been no begin- 
ning to "Hook-worm". 

Cordially yours, 

S. G. P. 

[ enclose $1.00 for magazine. 



The change from the loud and strid- 
ent and plush-covered to the quiet and 
simple in manners, housekeeping and 
art is owing more to the influence of Wil- 
liam Morris than to any other man of 
the century. Morris said : "We need 
fewer things, and want them better. All 
your belongings should mean something 
to you. Every act of life should 
signify." 



During the Civil War a Union general 
came up with a small, straggling body of 
his own cavalry, wading through a foot 
of soft, sticky mud. As the general ap- 
proached, the troopers were drawn up 
to salute him; and in the midst of the 
floundering movement a man was thrown 
violently from his horse into the black, 
sticky mass. He crawled to his feet, a 
sorry spectacle. The general, smother- 
ing a laugh, rode up to him. "What's 
the matter, my man? Are you hurt?" 
the general asked, kindly. "Naw," re- 
plied the man, turning around his grimy 
face. "I ain't hurt none; but, if I ever 
love a country agin, you can kick mef"

Our new 



Potatoes made their way very slowly 
into popular favor in England, and were 
far too expensive to be seen on the table 
of any but' the richest people. In the 
reign of James I. their price was two 
shillings a pouiid. Soon after the Res- 
toration the government and the Royal 
Society tried to encourage the cultiva- 
tion ; but progress was slow, and it was 
not until nearly the end of the eighteenth 
century that the tuber came into popular 



It is right and necessary that all men 
should have work to do which shall be 
worth doing, and be of itself pleasant to 
do : and which should be done under 
such conditions as would make it neither 
over-wearisome nor over-anxious. Turn 
that claim about as I may, think of it as 
long as I can, I can not find that it is an 
exorbitant claim; yet again I say if So- 
ciety would or could admit it the face of 
the world would be changed ; discontent 
and strife and dishonesty would be 
ended. To feel that we were doing work 
useful to others and pleasant to our- 
selves, and that such work and its due 
reward could not fail us 1 What serious 
harm could happen to us then? — WiUiam 
Morris.

Ticiently hot, and euouah fat being used t 

Eletely cover the articles cooked. Use a deep 
fttle for frying, a Scotch bowl like the one 
illustrated, preferably, and till it two-thirds full 
of Simon Pure leaf lard [leaf lard because that is 
the tinert of lards and Simon Pure Uaf lard be- 
cause that is the very cream of leaf lards). Set 
the kettle on the fire and when hot enough to 
throw off a faint blue hase It is the risfat tem- 
perature for frying. The articles to be tried are 
dropped in slowly (must housekeepers Use a wire 
basket for this) a few bI h time so that the heat 
is not reduced too much. The hot fat at once 
sears the outside and forms a crust through which 
the grease cannot penetrate and all the natural 



juice of the article cooked is preserved. When 
done lift from the hot fat and bold over the 
kettle tor a second to drip Lay on kitchen paper 
in the open oven until quite dry. Codied in tnb 
way the food will be so free of grease so as not to 
leave a mark on the napkin on wbicb it is served. 

The importance of using Armour's Simon Pure 
leaf lard for fr^ijg is gieat. Being an absolutely 
pure leaf lard it ensures a delicate sweetness wher- 
ever it is used. The rendering process throu^ 
which the fat goes is very much the same as that 
of our grandmothera' day. It is done in open 
kettles so that there are no odors in the finislied 
lard to be thrown off later in cooking. Tie same 
lard may be used again and again without carry- 
ing the flavor of one article to another. Simoo 
Pure leaf lard is the outcome of halt a century's 
experience in lard making. 

Simon Pure leaf lard comes to the housewite in 
seeled pails so that the purity is protected. 

Use It according to directions for fryins and 
your dishes will not only be toothsome and dainty 
but digestible as well.

LIBRARY AND LIVING BOOM 

A Home of the Past and Present 

By Rosamond Lampman 



AT the end of a quiet shady street, 
once a village lane, and where an 
atmosphere of old time romance 
still lingers, stands the quaint home of 
Mr. Everett Fowler at Kingston, N.Y., 
built when Dutch good fellowship reigned 
supreme nearly two centuries ago, and 
which bids fair to maintain its present 



usefulness another hundred years. Al- 
though rejuvenated and restored in many 
ways its original style has been preserved 
and its long, low lines and thick stone 
walls present a pleasing appearance 
particularly fascinating to lovers of the 
colonial. 

Neither is this house, standing where 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



THE QUAINT DUTCH DOOR 

the flickering shadows of the tall trees 
playing hide-and-seek on its gray walls 
seem to give it charcater like the lines in 
a dear old face, without its touch of 
history. In these days of peace and 
plenty in our land it is difficult to imag- 
ine quiet Kingston as a centre of nat- 
ional trials, conflicts, and impending dan- 
gers; once a fortified town, and once 
raided and biUTied by the envious British, 
while its terrified inhabitants were 
forced to flee to the little town of Hurly, 
three miles away, for safety. Among the 
few desolate homes, left standing, were the 
blackened walls of this sturdy house, 
whose pioneer owner had spent many 
weary months in building, and which was 
again bravely restored to its former use- 
fulness during the Revolution. 

The front entrance of this interesting 
house is the key-note of its character 
and the very embodiment of Dutch wel- 
come and hospitality. There is no porch 
here, merely a hood extending out over a^-? 
massive white door, which swings in two 
sections, adorned with a handsome old 
brass knocker; this, with the charming 
decorative frieze above it, the simple 
fluted pilasters at either side, and its 



unomate stone steps is a typical example 
of an early eighteenth century front door. 
Among the few necessary changes made 
in the exterior, a roomy porch has been 
built to the right, the straight lines of the 
roof, picturesquely broken here and there 
by dormers, and the solid paneled shut- 
ters, exchanged for more modern ones. 

The charm of the interior lies in the 
rearrangement of the rooms, and the suc- 
cessful mingling of oldtime fittings with 
modem conveniences. While the old 
lines are here, as are the old fireplaces 
and cozy, low-beamed ceilings, new floors 
have taken the place of the time-worn 
ones, and tiny closet-like bed-rooms and 
pantries have been opened into quaint 
alcoves, that give the rooms in which 
they open a unique distinction of seem- 
ing lai^er than they really are. The 
great front door leads directly into one of 
these captivating recesses, once a dark 
and narrow hallway; though the stair-

case ascending to the rooms above has 
not been altered, there are on either side 
wide archways opening into rooms that 
light it and give it apparent breadth. 

The room at the left of this entrance 
is the happy combination of library and 
living room. Here a closet has been 
utilized into a charming nook, in which 
are built-in book shelves, a delightful 
old mahogany table, and a comfortable 
reading chair. The plastered walls are 
painted a sage green, and the ceiling, 
beams, and wood-work a darker shade. 
The floor, too, is stained this dark green, 
over which is placed green and white 
Navajo rugs. The commodious old 
fireplace, built of Dutch brick, brought 
over froniHoIIand,withfacings and hearth 
of plaster, is well equipped with antique 
fittings; these and the old Dutch brass 
box and milk-can, on either side the wide 
hearth, accord quaintly with the shield- 
shape backs and dainty carvings of the 
Heppelwhite chairs, the dignified grand- 
father's clock, and the simple white flut- 
ed curtains at the deep-casement win- 
dows. 



The parlor at the right of the little hall, 
finished in colonial white, with polished 
floor and Oriental rugs, is a harmonious 
contrast to the color scheme of the lib- 
rary. While the fireplace with its simple 
shdf and plain paneling is the same as the 
other, there is a decorated iron back with 
the date, 1764, in high relief across the 
face. This room is replete with antique 
furniture, and the soft cream forms an 
effective back-ground for the time-soft- 
ened hues of old mahogany and quaint 
upholstery. At the far end of this room 
another simple alcove, once an old- 
fashioned bed-recess, forms a fitting 
place for the piano, and beyond this is 
the dining-room, which was originally 
kitchen and bed-room combined. 

To the lover of old-time table acces- 
sories there are few rooms more interest- 
ing than this one; the white plate-rails 
running around the softly tinted walls 
hold a delightful collection of rare old 
china, among them many pieces of old 
blue Staffordshire with American views, 
so dear to the heart of every American 
collector of this old ware. Graceful

decanters and frail old wine glasses, lend- 
ing misty visions of toothsome pound- 
cake and rich red wine, grace the old- 
time side-board. A quaint girandole 
with tinkUng prisms, whose twinkling 
lights have illimiinated many a feast, and 
a stately coflfee-um, once the joy and 
pride of some dear old colonial dame, 
stand side by side. Polished old pewter, 
brass and silver, catching the glint of the 
sunshine, reflect whimsically the rich 
colors of a unique collection of Dutch 
steins hanging blithely above them. Here 
good Dutch hospitality is again ex- 
pressed by the fire-place within a snug 
recess, the swinging brass tea-kettle 
over the fire, that sings a merry little 
tune on dull afternoons, and the cozy 
settle standing invitingly near. 

At the south side of the dining-room a 
commodious kitchen has been built, 
equipped with all the modem improve- 
ments needed in a well appointed kit- 
chen, and above this are comfortable 
sleeping apartments for the domestics. 

On the second floor are the family 
sleeping rooms, each fitted, like the low- 
er ones, with old-time fittings. In one 



of these rooms one sees an odd example 
of fireplaces, built without the accus- 
tomed high mantel, but, instead, there is 
a quaint niche nestling high up on either 
side of the broad chinMiey. In this room 
are many pieces of early eighteenth cen- 
tury make, and the heavy handsome 
mahogany sleigh-bed, the Sleepy-hollow 
chair, roomy high-boy, old sewing-table, 
and secretary with its secret draw, have, 
each, their special charm, and here, as 
throughout the house, lingers a delight- 
ful old-time atmosphere. 

The third floor, once an old-fashion 
attic, mysterious and gloomy, has been 
transformed into a comfortable den. A 
new floor has been laid, and the dormer 
windows light it. There is a built-in 
cabinet with sliding glass doors running 
the half of one side, containing the own- 
er's fine collection of curios and small an- 
tiques. The furniture here is also in 
keeping with the character of the house, 
and the chairs, tables,spinning-wheel,and 
desk, as well as the pictxu'es, war imple- 
ments, and Indian relics on the walls, 
all bear the hallmarks of brave old Rev- 
olutionary days. 



Autumn Days 



■< •■ 



Oh, the grey days, the gold days. 

When Autumn's on the wing. 
When hills are dim with shrouding haze. 
And through the mist you see a blaze 
Where painted leaves still cling. 

Oh, the still hours, the sweet hours, 

Alone upon the hills. 
The strange, enchanted, mystic shrine, 
The air like sparkling, amber wine 

That quickens, stirs and thrills. 

Oh, the glad days, the sad days, 
When summer has grown old. 

The days when joy and pain are blent 

Into a perfect sweet content. 
Knowing the tale is told.

BANKING CELERY AT SMELTZER 



California's Winter Celery Crop 

By Charles A. Byers 



DURING the past season Orange 
County, CaUfomia, shipped to 
eastern and northern markets 
approximately seven hundred carloads 
of celery, harvested from about 2,000 
acres. A carload of California celery, at 
the packing house, is worth approxi- 
mately $600, making the total amount 
shipped worth to the growers something 
like $420,000 gross, or $210 per acre. 
Although this was one of the most pros- 
perous seasons the state's growers have 
ever experienced, these figures never- 
theless will give to the outsider a fair 
idea of how profitable the industry really 
is. 

The United States every winter con- 
sumes tons of celery, as one of the prin- 
dpal "trimmings" of the turkey dinner, 
and it is to the growers of Southern 
California that the country looks for its 
crispest and finest mid-winter supply. 
The:gfbwers here seed in February, begin 
to harvest in October and finish up the 
season again in February, which means 
that the crop is harvested during the 
real winter months when the demand is 
keenest. In this respect California has 



a considerable advantage over New 
York, Michigan and Florida, the other 
leading celery-growing sections, and con- 
sequently she receives somewhat better 
prices than do the growers of these other 
states. The marketing of the celery 
crops of New York and Michigan ends 
about the last of October, on account of 
the cold winters, just at the beginning o£ 
the California harvesting time, and the 
Florida crop does not begin to appear in 
the market until about February, com- 
peting slightly with the close of the 
California crop. 

Much of the western shipments of the 
past season sold in the markets of the 
East at 55 cents per dozen bunches, 
which is considered a top price, even for 
the mid-winter crop. In fact, the high- 
est price ever before received by the 
California growers was 45 cents per 
dozen bunches. The railroads, how- 
ever, receive a large proportion 'of this. 
The freight on a carload of California 
celery consigned to New York City, is 
about $300, which means that the New 
Yorker must pay something like $900 
per carload.

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



Of course, the western grower does 
not possess anything like a monopoly on 
the mid-winter market, even if his crop 
is marketed fresh ; much of the Michigan 
and New York crops goes into storage for 
the holidays, and even though it loses 
some of its crispness, it offers strong com- 
petition. A consignment of the Cali- 
fornia crop will reach New York in 
about fourteen days, and, therefore, 
within a little more than two weeks 
from the time the celery is taken from 
the ground,it can be served with aChrist- 
mas dinner in almost any part of the 
East. 

California celery is shipped to every 
state in the Union, as well as to nearly 
all parts of Canada. The crop consists 
of two varieties, the Golden Heart and 
the Green Top, the former being an 
early variety and the latter a late 
variety. The former is grown in much 
the larger quantity. A carload of celery 
is made up of about 200 crates, each con- 
taining ten dozen bunches. There are 
usually three grades, and the prices 
naturally vary accordingly. 

The celery-producing district of Cal- 
ifornia is confined almost entirely to 
Orange County, the small town of 
Smeltzer, located about forty miles 
south of Los Angeles, constituting the 
center of the industry. The area is a 



sort of peatland with a mixture in some 
localities of a wet clay. It was originally 
a great stretch of bog covered with 
sloughs and creeks, over which luxuriant 
growths of vegetation had been preci- 
pitating for years layer upon layer of 
peat ingredients. To convert it into 
tillable soil, it was necessary to drain 
it, for which flumes and ditches, leading 
to the ocean five miles away, were con- 
structed ; and on account of the swampy 
nature of the area these ditches are con- 
stantly maintained. 

The peatland portion of the area forces 
the celery plant into quick maturity, 
and from such localities comes the 
earlier part of the winter supply. The 
crops in the clay-soil area are developed 
much slower, and in this way the har- 
vesting season is prolonged over a much 
longer period. 

The celery-growing industry in Cali- 
fornia was started about eighteen years 
ago by D. E. Smeltzer, a former produce 
dealer of Kansas City, From that time 
the industry has steadily thrived and 
grown, and at present there are about 
175 celery growers in the district. 
About 90 per cent of these growers are 
banded together in an organization 
known as the Celery Growers' Associa- 
tion of Orange County, with headquarters 
at Smeltzer, and it is through this asso-

ciation that almost the entire crop is 
marketed. 

An acre of celery land in this locality 
is worth from $500 to $600. It will pro- 
duce, if the season is good, about 1,300 
dozen bunches, worth at the packing- 
house on an average of about 20 or 25 
cents per dozen bunches. The average 
yield per acre for the entire section, how- 
ever, is slightly less than 1,000 dozen 
btmches. Since the cost of production is 
rarely more than $35 or $50 per acre, the 
mar^n of profit is particularly tempting. 
An average crop is almost assured each 
year, and not a great deal of care in the 
way of planting and cultivation is 
required. 

The sowing of celery seed begins in 



February and sometimes continues until 
the last of April, depending upon the 
variety sown and the time that the mar- 
keting is planned for. One acre sown 
to seed will supply plants suflBdent for 
40 acres. The transplanting is done 
from the first of June until the first of 
September. The plants are set in rows, 
and are continually "banked" until the 
harvesting time, which bleaches the 
stalks and causes them to become white 
and crisp. During the marketing season 
the visitor to Smeltzer will see large 
wagons, heaped high withcrates of celery, 
forming a long caravan wending its way 
to the packing-house, and for months 
the air, thereabout, is heavily ladened 
with the redolent odor of the plant. 



Do Men Want Efficient Wives ? 

By An Observer 



NOT long ago there appeared a per- 
tinent article bemoaning the 
dearth of good wives for eligible young 
men. The author' of this cleverly ap- 
pealing disquisition purported to be an 
industrial magnate, employing in the 
neighborhood of four thousand men, who 
in the capacity of President of the Com- 
pany, partly through policy and partly 
through genuine interest in his fellow- 
kind, still retains a most friendly relation- 
ship with his workers. In fact, so keenly 
alive is he to their everyday problems and 
manner of living that oft-whiles the rise 
and fall of the steel market sinks into in- 
significance as he lays a discerning finger 
on the matrimonial fluctuations of his 
operatives. 

And this is the most recent report of 
this wide-awake observer. His medium 
salaried men, earning from twenty-five 
to fifty dollars a week, are not marrying. 
They are supporting comfortable clubs 
instead of families. His skilled mechanic 
and draughtsman, likewise the young col- 
lege graduate who is working in his shop, 



because some day he hopes to direct other 
men in other shops, are all martyrs to 
bachelorhood — and why? Because the 
present day young woman is so dazzled 
by the material glitter of the age that she 
has forgotten how to be a man's helpmate. 
In short, the twentieth century god of 
gold has outdistanced Cupid. 

It is indeed a sad commentary on the 
passing of the maiden of simple tastes, 
and I found myself shedding a responsive 
tear as I read the depicted loneliness of 
several promising men doomed to a 
'* waiting at the church" sentence. In- 
telligent, stalwart, red-blooded types of 
manhood they were. Think of the social 
waste! 

But, strange as it may seem, just at 
this juncture, there floated across my 
mental vision the faces of a half dozen 
clear-eyed, whole-souled girls whose 
names are fast appearing on the "to have 
and to hold" waiting list. 

Two of these young women are grad- 
uates of a domestic science course, one 
is a qualified trained niu^e, and others 



274 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



all wholseome, broad-hipped women, ad- 
admirably built for motherhood, yet, 
somehow, love has passed them by. 

Getting a firmer grip on the balance 
wheel of sympathy, I traversed the 
ground of a goodly bit of experience and 
there brought up short, face to face, with 
a few homely facts. 

Right here on my own street might be 
said to flourish a typical example of to- 
day's conditions. This street, let it be 
known, lies in the suburbs of one of our 
largest American cities. The residents 
of our thoroughfare are of the good mid- 
dle class Americans. We own our homes 
and take justifiable pride in our surround- 
ings. Here and^ there is sprinkled a name 
boasting, at least, the quality of age, so 
with true Eastern family reverence, a few 
of us may and do stiffen oiu* backbone 
with the thought that, if we are not ac- 
complishing much, why, grandfather did! 

However, on the whole, we are plain 
folk, just far enough removed from ab- 
ject poverty on one hand, and the deca- 
dent smart set on the other, to be repre- 
sentative of the rank and file of good 
citizenry. 

But what is more to the point, we have 
in our midst a comely array of marriage- 
able daughters. Here, indeed, would seem 
to be a favorite stamping ground for Dan 
Cupid, but,alas, it is a long time between 
arrows ! Perhaps the authority on rising 
steel and slumping matrimony can tell 
why. 

For instance, on my right lives Martha, 
a girl of moderately fine looks and modest 
tastes. She is a graduate of an old New 
England Academy, noted for its through- 
ness of instruction. Being an assiduous 
reader, she has materially supplemented 
the foundation work of school days by 
much worth-while browsing in the field 
of good literature. Martha, also, is a 
lover of good music and plays and sings 
most acceptably. Moreover, she is 
thoroughly domestic in her tastes and 
when **mother*' sees fit to take a vaca- 
tion, it is she who assumes the brunt of 
household management and capably 



mothers the younger members of the 
family. 

It doesn't seem a long while either 
since Martha had her sixteenth birthday 
party and the flag was hoisted on the 
family flag-pole in her honor. Since 
that time the birthday fStes have been 
fewer and less pronounced. To be really 
candid, recent natal anniversaries have 
drifted by unmentioned, and only what 
the street urchin terms "snitching" would 
reveal the fact that Martha is now fast 
approaching twenty-nine years of age 
and no gaUant knight comes riding. 

Then take the case of Margaret, who 
also lives dose by. Margaret, too, may 
boast of average looks with an additional 
dash of vivacity in her make-up that is 
most attractive. Two years ago this 
likely yoimg woman was graduated with 
honors from one of our leading colleges 
for women. While a conscientious stud- 
ent, she is thoroughly devoted to home 
interests, and a staunch lover of children. 
And it is to her credit, I record, that last 
year she took a less advantageous posi- 
tion as teacher in the local High School 
in order to be at home with her people. 
But, alas and alack! the confinement of 
such sedentary occupation is stamping 
her with the hall-mark of school-marmism. 
The youthful contour of face is fast being 
replaced by the settled dignity of the 
disciplinarian, which is augmented by a 
perceptible loss in weight. Yet she has 
signed for another year at the same in- 
stitution, and at present the vista of 
Margaret's future looks much like the 
lonely road to Spinsterville. 

Directly across the street from Mar- 
garet's home lives Helen. Although 
these girls are about the same age, they 
are as unlike as sparrow and blackbird. 
Helen is of the mannish type, and every 
move of her well-poised body suggests 
the keen and alert business woman that 
she is. Clothed in a trim-fitting, tailored 
gown, it is a pleastu"e to watch her stride 
buoyantly for the commuters' train to the 
city, where she is an invaluable assistant 
to one of the towering commercial me 



DO MEN WANT EFFICIENT WIFES? 



275 



of the metropolis. 

Housework and Helen seem as incon- 
gruous as date palms and snow fields, 
yet, this girl who openly avows a cordial 
dislike for homekeeping is engaged to be 
married. One cannot but wonder how 
a person so thoroughly inoculated with 
the business microbe will respond to tlie 
trying tests of domesticity, or if even a 
lullaby can drown the insidious caU of 
the office? 

But the well-worn trail on our avenue 
is to the door of Dorothy, or "Dot", as 
she is familiarly called, the little steno- 
grapher, who perhaps might best be 
described as thfe possessor of a well- 
ttimed ankle and a well-turned head. 
The former, she dresses attractively in a 
coquettish pump with the advantageous 
auxiliary of a split skirt. The latter, she 
adorns with the most fetching of ban- 
deaux and bows. She is what the land- 
faring male observer of our suburban 
Rialto calls "some-class"., and the sea- 
faring guest of masculine persuasion who 
makes our port terms *'a trim little 
craft." Intellectually, she prides herself 
on doing Marathons through the season's 
"best sellers," and what she knows of 
household accomplishments might be 
written on the back of a postage stamp, 
and then leave sufficient space for the 
lover of wide margins. vShe is neither 
atheltic or even robust looking, but she 
can purse her lips into a challenging pout, 
and do a high presstu^e stimt with her 
eyes that seem to bring results. One by 
one, the yoimg men, shying away from 
a Beethoven sonata, congregate on her 
front porch to hear a melting interpre- 
tation of "Peg o' My Heart" to the 
novice-like accompaniment of her guitar. 
And, one by one, they fall captive to her 
nonsense and modishness! 

They are not all feather-brained 
youths either. A few weeks ago none 
other than a hard-headed college-bred 
man fell captive to her wiles, and offered 
heart and hand. All of which prompts 
the italicized question: Do our young men 
really want efficient wives 1 



Now, is this street of mine peculiar or 
exceptional in matrimonial adventures ? 
I can duplicate this self-same state of 
affairs in almost any adjoining locality. 

This Fall the wedding bells will ring 
for one of the town's fashionable daugh- 
ters. She, fortunately, has been given 
opportunities for culture and travel that 
are extremely desirable. But the plain, 
dependable science of household manage- 
ment has been totally ignored. She who 
can writhe through the Turkey Trot, 
Grizzly Bear and Bunny Hug in ap- 
proved fashion will, when shorn of her so- 
cial accomplishments and swagger trap- 
pings, approach the golden privilege of 
home-building with unprepared hands 
and a tired, anaemic body. 

One may argue that these are only a 
handful of blind fools and the recorder 
of them the victim of circumscribed 
vision. In justice, may I say that she 
has not spent her days in a two by two 
township putting a diamond finish on her 
narrow views. In the North, South, and 
beautiful golden West, she has encount- 
ered similarly unfortunate conditions. 

Almost unfailingly, in seven cases out . 
of ten, where the game of wife hunting 
is in progress, you will see the willing 
male partner following devotedly in the 
wake of the untrained, peacocky type of 
womanhood. 

It is all very well to try to soften our , 
emotions by quoting the case of the fine 
moral specimen of modem Adonis, earn- 
ing sixty dollars per week, who was cruelly 
jilted by some money-mad butterfly, 
but what of the worth-while girl who 
is never asked. 

Considering the fact that the female 
population is greatly in preponderance 
of numbers, there is certainly a large per- 
centage of marketable feminine ability 
waiting to give proof of efficiency. 

Man has found no difficulty in stand- 
ardizing woman's morality in the mar- 
riage question. Is he unequal to regula- 
ting the other requirements of wifehood? 

Let him brush some twentieth centiuy 
scales from his eyes and take an X-ray

peep at a woman's true worth when he 
essays the role of Romeo. 

For fear some may suspect that the 
writer is lingering in the lonely realm of 
old-maid-dom, and hereby merely giv- 
ing evidence of a crab-apple-like tart- 
ness of disappointment, let me whis- 
per that I am fast nearing the "fat, fair, 
and forty" brigade of married contingents 
and here in the soft light of middle years 
I like to sit and tell the rosary of youth- 
ful satisfactions. I like to think that 
at twenty-one I married for love a poor 
man and such service as I have been in 
promoting his interests has been adequate 
compensation. I like to think of how I 
have been broadened and bettered by 
motherhood and to give ardent thanks 
that I early appreciated the unparalleled 



greatness of the service of the devoted 
home-maker. 

This too, is the heart history of many 
of my neighbors, and, intuitivdy, I sense 
the same roseate dream in the breasts of 
scores of qualified, home-loving girls — 
the steel magnate and his discriminating 
employees to the contrary. 

And there will be a marked increase of 
this desirable type as soon as men create 
the demand and cease to kow-tow to a 
trick of dress or some bewitching co- 
quetry of manner. And that will be 
when men's hearts have been more se- 
verely pricked by divorce than by the 
shafts of Cupid, and when e;nshrined in 
the secret souls of mankind an efficient 
wife has come into her own, — emanci- 
pated from the fads and frills of fashion. 



The Candle Light 

Oh, many a view there is that charms, 

And many a pleasing si^ht. 
The waving grain of the hillside farms 

And the £^pple orchards bright. 
These for a day but when darkness falls 

Oh, then, through the gloom of night 
There's nothing sweet as the voice that calls 

In a love-lit window light. 

Where e'er we wander, whatever we see. 

Somehow there's a cloud at last, 
And the heart that wearies and would be free 

Calls out for the happy past. 
Oh, then, God grant, that we shall not seek 

In vain for the welcome sight 
Of the smile we knew, and the welcome true 

In a love-lit window light.

Her Heart Warming 

By Mix Thorn 



THE open fire blazed hopefully, as if 
doing its best to dispel the gloom 
of the gray November day, and to 
turn the sedate old room into a cheerful 
comfortable place, and Miss Elizabeth, 
resting a well-shod foot on the fender, 
watched the bright flames intently, yet 
there was no answering brightness in her 
face. Thanksgiving was approaching, 



Thanksgiving, that day dedicated to fam- 
ily reunions, feasting and jollity, and, 
she told herself honestly, that she wished 
she might go to sleep the day before, and 
not awaken until it was all, all over and 
past, and she could pursue, undisturbed, 
her uneventful routine. She turned to- 
ward the window, restlessly, as if the 
change of scene might give her the de-

sired change of thought, but dull Novem- 
ber's brown fields stretched far, the leaf- 
less trees lifted bare branches to a leaden 
sky, and there was a promise of snow. 

Not always had she so dreaded the hol- 
iday season, the thin lips set in a firmer 
line, not always, and a sudden vision 
flashed before her mind's eye of the gay 
household of which she was once a part. 
What preparations they had made, she 
and her sister and her brothers, aided and 
abetted by both father and mother. No 
need then for open fires to dispel the 
gloom, for youth reigned, and there was 
never a thought of somber days to come. 
How the cousins came flocking, gathering 
arotmd the long table, and what appe- 
tites they all had. What didn't they find 
to be merry over! 

Yet now, now she was alone in the 
house she had, six months before, inher- 
ited from an Aunt, whose namesake she 
was; living in a little New England town, 
in which she was a comparative stranger. 
Her sister was in California, one brother 
in Paris, the other with his absorbing 
family in New York, and she felt today 
like that last sad leaf on the tree, or 
Moore's pathetic dreamer, who trod alone 
the deserted banquet hall. 

Old Katie, inherited with the house, 
long a servant of her aunt, busied her- 
self around the familiar kitchen, touch- 
ingly anxious to concoct tasty dishes for 
the new mistress, sure of her art; while 
upstairs, Myra, the newly engaged little 
maid, a product of the village, set in or- 
der the spacious bedroom which Miss 
Elizabeth had selected for her own. And 
here it was, a few moments later, that 
Miss Elizabeth found this light-hearted 
young person. She was assuring the 
window seat, as she vigorously brushed 
it, that her Bonnie was over the ocean, 
said ocean being held considerably longer 
than the composer had designed that it 
should be. 

**Cold, aint it?" was her remark as her 
mistress entered the room. **I was say- 
in' to Katie in the kitchen, that it was 
what my Aunt Hat always called real 



nippin' Thanksgivin' weather. Makes 
a body feel good, though, don't it?" 

"Does it?" was the reply, and Miss 
Elizabeth's tone was not what might be 
termed enthusiastic. Yet it was not 
her intention to chill the little maid's 
mood, rather she felt herself instinctively 
reaching out for any bit of cheer this 
morning. 

"So you like such weather, do you?" 
she began in what she believed was an 
encotiraging tone. 

"I guess I do," was Myra's instant re- 
joinder ;"why it brings Thanksgivin', and 
everyone is wanting that, that is most 
everybody, for I know some as ain't." 

**Do you, who are they?" enquired 
Miss Elizabeth idly. 

"Well," and Myra laid down her cloth, 
"there's old Mr. Finch who lives at the 
hotel. All his folks, they tell me, is dead 
and gone; he's 'most eighty. Nice old 
gentleman, with a kind word for every- 
body. Wears a sort of funny, shiney, tall 
hat, and carries a gold-topped cane, like 
a minister. 

Well, then, there's the widow Foskett, 
who lives at the hotel too, — her husband 
was Doctor Foskett that doctored here 
in this town for years. Why Gramma 
knew him well, and my mother, too, 
and I can just sort of remember him in 
his old buggy. I guess she can't be much 
younger than Mr. Finch is, but she's the 
sort that smiles as if she'd got into the 
habit of smiling and didn't see the use of 
stopping. She wasn't left with much, 
but she's got as handsome a room as 
you'd ask to see ; all furnished with things 
from the Foskett house. She's not a 
chick or a child, but she's liked, she is. 
She's asked me to her room some 
evenin's when I was helpin' out at the 
hotel. My, but her chairs are as'restin' 
ones, as you ever saw. 

Then there's that old Miss Abigal 
Morton, always called Miss Abigal, who 
lives alone by herself in that little brown 
house below the church. She's kind 'o 
lame, and because it's a trouble to [get to 
her places, she's seldom asked*out. And

then, well, then the only other one I can 
recall now that ain*t anticipatin' Thanks- 
givin' much, is that yellow-haired young 
school teacher, Miss Blake, who boards 
at the store-keeper's. She comes from 
up Vermont way, and the vacation's too 
short for her to get home and back again, 
I heard her telling some one." 

"So all these people are not very glad 
of Thanksgiving," was Miss Elizabeth's 
sole answer. Yet two hours later, as 
she sat at her solitary lunch in the large, 
quiet dining room, her thoughts reverted 
to those village neighbors of whom her 
little maid had spoken at such length. 

Were they, too, like herself — the old 
man, the two women, and that yellow- 
haired school mistress, dreading Thanks- 
giving, striving to forget unforgettable 
things ! Untasted stood the dainty lunch 
before her, as she sat lost in a day-dream. 
And as she mused, behold a miracle! 
She conjiu'ed up a circle of unknown 
guests around her table; strange faces had 
they all, but the gloom was dispelled, a 
genial warmth pervaded her being, and 
her thoughts seemed to have peopled the 
silence. 

**Sure and she ate no lunch," was old 
Katie's comment to Myra, as together 
they did the dishes," only took a sup of 
tea, but, the poor lady, she looked a bit 
happier when she give me an order, ten 
minutes since. 

Perhaps now, she's lookin' forward, as 
the quality docs, to Thanksgivin'. Do 
you remember, child, it's but four days 
off?" 

Myra's sole answer was an involuntary 
sigh, which she explained later by re- 
marking — **I wish Katie, I do, that we 
were goin' to have a real fine dinner-party 
here; a table just full, instead of one 
lady, and she such a quiet one." 

Old Katie, however, did not hear her 
young helper, as she was busily clatter- 
ing silver. 

**I will want the carriage at ten, John," 
said Miss Elizabeth, next morning, to the 
sturdy young country boy who was her 
driver, "I shall make several calls, bring 



the warm robes, and be prompt, John." 

**Yes, *um, "was the reply, and Miss 
Elizabeth, an excited flush on her usually 
pale face, went into breakfast. 

"To the hotel first, John," and Miss 
Elizabeth's even voice had a curious 
thrill in it, and to the hotel they went. 
She was gone but a short time, yet, as she 
entered the carriage, her mouth was 
smiling, and her lips were smiling, too. 

**Now to the school house, John," was 
her further command, "You know where 
it is, I suppose. 

"Guess I do,Ma'am," was the cheerful 
rejoinder, "used to go there myself, when 
I was a little tyke, every day regular. 
Get up, boy, — " this last to the shining 
bay. 

"Really," said Miss Elizabeth, enter- 
ing the carriage, again, and tucking the 
robe more securely around her fur-coated 
self, "this has been a distinct sensation, 
calling on a village school mistress; find- 
ing her just a dear and charming girl, and 
being received as if I were, indeed, an 
angel of light." 

"Do you know where Miss Abigal 
Morton lives, John?" 

"Good land, yes, old lady Morton's 
ain't more'n a quarter of a milefromhere ; 
a little brown house back from the road, 
lay lock bushes each side of it." 

Straight up the steps went erect Miss 
Elizabeth, and the ancient knocker an- 
nounced her in noisy fashion, bringing 
the frail little owner of the brown house 
to the door, sweetly surprised to see her 
visitor. Here it was that Miss Elizabeth 
lingered longest, but it was not yet twelve 
o'clock, when John received his final or- 
der, "And now, home, John." 

Before her long mirror stood Miss Eliz- 
abeth, arranging her soft graying hair — 
"Was it a sudden impulse!" she spoke 
aloud, as if to an unseen presence in the 
still room, "It was unlike myself, but. 
but I am glad they are coming, I can 
truthfully say I am glad they are all com- 
ing — positively I seem to be almost 
looking forward to Thanksgiving." 

"We a,re to have four guests for dii\ner 



HER HEART WARMING. 



279 



Thursday, Katie," announced Miss Eliz- 
abeth, that same evening," and I am sure 
I can count upon you to give us a de- 
licious dinner. You will like a larger 
family. I understand no real cook enjoys 
cooking for one only." 

From her comer by the kitchen closet, 
round-eyed and smiling Mjrra watched 
and listened. John had reported where 
he had driven his mistress that morning, 
and the little maid was sure she knew 
who were the expected guests. 

Miss Elizabeth awoke early next day, 
with a pleasant sense of anticipation, 
which remained with her, though her 
first peep out of the window disclosed 
the fact that a leaden sky gloomed above 
the village, while, a chill wind blustered 
around the old house. 

"We must manage to have enough 
brightness inside, to make us forget the 
clouds to-day," she thought, as she 
dressed. "I told John to call at the hotel 
at ten, bring them here, and then go 
straight away for the others. 

''Dinner will not be until two o'clock, 
so my guests will have a chance to get 
nicely rested and acquainted, and, first 
of all, to become acquainted with me." 

A few moments before the expected 
hour. Miss Elizabeth, in her dainty white 
gown, stood in the wide entrance hall, 
waiting to receive the first comers, for 
already the rattle of wheels sounded 
down the drive; and it was she. gracious, 
welcoming, who held out both hands to 
the shyly smiling little old lady, who was 
being gallantly assisted up the stone 
steps by a dignified old gentleman. 

''I am so very glad to see you both," 
cried Miss Elizabeth, and in her tones 
there was the ring of sincerity." Oh,Mrs. 
Foskett,were you at all cold! There is 
such a change in the weather." 

**Cold, oh, no," chirped the newcomer, 
**I enoyed every minute of the drive, and 
so did Mr. Finch, now didn't you? "ap- 
pealing to her companion. 

"Certainly I did," with a quaint bow 
toward Miss Elizabeth, "it was delight- 
ful in that comfortable carriage." 



Half an hour later, wheels again sounded 
on the drive, bringing the other expected 
ones; soon after Miss Elizabeth's guests 
were gathered in the library before the 
open fire — the four older people and the 
pink-cheeked girl. Miss Abigal, sweet 
faced and white haired, held Helen Blake's 
slim hand in her own wrinkled one, 
while she visited with her. Mr. Finch 
pored eagerly over a rare old book he h^ 
discovered on a remote shelf, while Mrs. 
Foskett knitted on a wonderful muffler 
designed for a village child. 

And bless me, what a cheerful tableful 
they were, when, at last, dinner was ready, 
old Katie and beaming Myra serving 
them. Mr. Finch told some anecdotes 
of his boyhood. Mrs. Foskett's eyes 
brimmed with tears, even as she smiled, 
when recounting some of her physician- 
husband's experiences in his country 
practice. Miss Abigal encouraged the 
little teacher to tell them of the doings 
of her most lovable, yet most mis- 
chievous pupil, and Miss Elizabeth was 
an appreciative listener. 

How changed was her familiar dining 
room; it was not the candles with their 
rosy shades nor yet the softly pink 
chrisanthemum center-piece that altered 
all, it was the happiness and good cheer, 
that, like the spirit of Thanksgiving, un- 
seen yet pervasive, made itself felt. 

The wintry dusk was closing down, 
when they drove away to their several 
homes,- and Miss Elizabeth stood at the 
hall window looking out at the tall pine 
trees, which the snow flakes were thickly 
powdering. Still she smiled as she re- 
called the good-byes she had just heard. 

"It has been such a perfect day for me, 
I hope you enjoyed it half as much," 
Mrs. Foskett had whispered. 

"I expected to be so homesick and 
miserable, dear Miss Elizabeth," the 
young girl cried, "and I've had the lovli- 
est time. Of course I'll come to see you 



soon.

"Oh, dear lady, you've given an old 
man a wonderful day to remember, a bit 
of his past brought back," and Mr. Finch's

voice was not quite steady. 

"It's a good deal to make four people 
as happy as you have this Thanksgiving,*' 
Miss Abigal murmured, her faded blue 
eyes misty, "how many times I shall re- 
live it." 

Miss Elizabeth was once more alone, 
yet she felt no sadness. Her rooms 
seemed to re-echo with her guests 
happy voices, and a glow was at her 



heart. 

"It was my little maid that showed 
me what I should do, my little maid," 
she humbly owned, "and this day shall 
be but a beginning. I will not abuse my 
stewardship, my latch string shall be out: 
how many lonely ones there are that 
need me, and my hospitality, even as I 
need them; oh, the joy of being a lady 
bountiful, oh, the jo}?' of it." 



Two House-Mothers 

By Flora Huntley 



THERE is a rule of Physics taught 
in every school, to the effect that 
action and reaction are equal ; that 
what is gained in power is lost in time. 
In the Literature class this law is further 
emphasized. It was Emerson who said : 
"For everything you have missed you 
have gained something else; and for 
everything you gain, you lose something." 

Men, in the business world everywhere 
recognize this principle and conserve 
their time, economize intelligently, and 
expend where it will bring results. They 
look to the future rather than to the work 
of a single day, and determine what will 
pay in the long rim. But the women in 
the home too often plod through their 
work without reflection, under the im- 
pression that the harder the}^ work the 
better for the family. The less- hired 
done, the greater the financial resources. 
This lack of intelligence in the household 
problems is what makes the wife a drudge 
or an invalid, when a little reflection 
would establish a system that would 
bring far greater returns to the whole 
family. 

Health, leisure and money: these are 
the points of consideration for the aver- 
age mother, usually considered in the 
reverse order: how to save money; how 
to save time; how to save her own 
strength. What she forgets is that she 
does one at the expense of the other, and 
that a saving of money may mean an 



illness or other untoward loss. 

Next door to mc there lives a woman 
who does "her own" work: laundry, 
cooking, baking, preserving and house- 
cleaning. She makes her own and her 
daughter's clothes, from a tailored suit 
to an evening gown, and she does it well. 
She is literally wife, mother, cook and 
char-woman, as well as a good companion 
to her husband. But she seldom passes 
a week without a sick headache, and the 
doctor's bills are no small item of ex- 
pense. This she considers tmavoidable. 
When her friends remonstrate and tell 
her Ae works too hard, she says there is 
no other way; that they can not afford to 
hire any help whatever; that her husband 
does not like baker's bread; the house 
must be kept in order for the sake of the 
example to the children. They are eager 
to help mother, but she is so tired and 
nervous that the effort to teach them is 
only an added strain, and she sometimes 
has to leave home for a rest of a day or 
two. Before she was married she had a 
music class, but she dropped that work, 
because she had no time for practice. 
She looks old and tired, but declares there 
is a satisfaction in knowing she has done 
her full duty to her family. But has she ? 
Across the street her neighbor man- 
ages quite differently. She, too, keeps 
no regular servant, but she believes that 
the laundry, the bakery, the cannery and 
soap-factory have taken the place of 



TWO HOUSE-MOTHERS 



281 



eighteenth century methods, when all 
these mantifacttiries were carried on in 
the farmer's kitchen. She tests and in- 
vestigates, to find the most wholesome 
and sanitary conditions, and then buys 
intelligently. She spends little time on 
fancy salads and desserts, but serves sim- 
ple fruits or nuts, or a sweet at the end of 
the meal. Once a week the laundryman 
calls for the '*flat pieces,'* including the 
everyday napkins and tablecloths. Once 
in two weeks a woman comes to the house 
to wash the underclothes, aprons and 
handkerchiefs. She also cleans the kit- 
chen and bath-room. This takes half a 
day and costs a dollar. Sometimes she 
is kept a whole day, if there are shirt- 
waists to be done up, dainty stocks or 
linen to iron or extra cleaning to be done. 
Twice a month a vacuum cleaner goes 
over all rugs, sofa pillows and curtains. 
This, too, costs a dollar, but it eliminates 
all sweeping except in the kitchen and the 
brushing up of crumbs in the dining- 
room. The fuel bill is reduced almost 
one-half, and the doctor never visits this 
home. Before the mother was married 
she was something of an artist and she 
still has time to paint a set of dinner cards 
or a Christmas motto, if an order comes, 
and in this way she pays for many a day's 
cleaning. She looks younger and hap- 



pier every year and her husband and 
children regard her as a comrade and 
playfellow rather than as an overworked 
servant. "Poor mother, how tired you 
look!" is never a comment in that home. 

When will women learn that it is poor 
economy to overwork, to undertake too 
great a variety of occupations, to neg- 
lect a talent or to abandon a field where 
one is a skilled worker? What business 
man would try to be his own bookkeeper, 
stenographer, clerk and salesman, and, 
at the same time, do the sweeping in his 
store and the washing of windows? It 
would be extravagance to spend his time 
in this way. 

The mother is the greatest asset of the 
home. Her most valued capital is health 
and leisure to guide her children. A 
home is much more than a restaurant or 
a dormitory, and the woman, who spends 
a great deal of time on the three meals a 
day, with the accompaning dishwashing, 
is putting the profession of cook higher 
than that of mother and teacher A 
little reflection and a careful expenditure 
of money will bring greater returns tothe 
family than an. enlarged bank account, 
and thiS memory of a happy helpful 
mother is a greater inspiration to the 
young man than the recollection of a 
clean floor or a good dinner. 



The Wane of The Year 



When crimson fires of summer wane 

Upon the misty hills, 
And grey clouds brim with silver rain 

The cruses of the rills, 
Let not the fires of love burn dim; 

Though fades the summer's glow, 
For love there is no farewell hymn, 

Her roses never blow. 

The white smoke of the autumn fires 

Shall drift across the miles, 
Upborne from summer's ashen pyres 

On hill, in woodland's aisles, 
But love within the heart shall burn 

When summer's lips are cold. 
When to the earth the fields return 

Their hoards of gathered gold.

How One Bride Learned Elfficiency 



By Etta C. Dunbar 



THE first winter of our married life 
my husband and I decided to give a 
seriesof small, weekly dinners to our 
friends, on what has been considered by 
them a rather novel plan. Our idea was 
that these dinners should be simple, in- 
formal and as inexpensive as possible, 
but as perfect as we could make them. 
Out of a list of our friends, either indi- 
vidual or mutual, he was to select the 
guests, not less than two nor more than 
four, and I was not to know who they 
were to be. I was to select a menu out 
of some cook book or magazine and fol- 
low it to the letter, regardless as to whe- 
ther the dishes were all new or not, and 
he was not to know what it was to be. 
A younger sister was to help me, for our 
mutual benefit. 

As one important consideration was 
economy, instead of buying expensive 
flowers at the green house we used a 
house plant that was in bloom, or flowers 
from the garden when they were to be 
had. Even the simplest of these could 
be arranged artistically and looked very 
pretty. 

Also, as my kitchen was not well 
equipped with utensils, I was to get what- 
ever was necessary or would help me 
materially in my work. The plan worked 
splendidly. My sister and I learned to 
prepare a great number of dishes that 
were new to us; we became quite inge- 
nious in meeting emergencies ; we became 
very systematic in our work; my kitchen 
was suoplied with modem utensils that, 
otherwise,! might not have had for years, 
and,in a short time,we were able to serve 
a dinner to our most distinguished guests 
■quite as calmly as we had hitherto enter- 
tained our most intimate friends; and 
we met our friends in a more intimate 
way than we could have done otherwise. 

I kept a record of each dinner, giving 
date, guests, centerpiece and menu, and 



now when we glance over this note book 
we recall little inciJunts and experiences 
that give us pleasure as well as remind 
us of some of our mistakes. 

The following is the record of the first 
of such dinners: 
Date: Friday, March 3, 1911 
Guests: Miss Blair, Mr. Jones 
Centerpiece: Cyclamen 

Menu 

Tomato Soup Crackers 

Baked Fish Hollandaise Sauce 

Shadow Potatoes Cole Slaw 

Fig Pudding 

CoflFee 

This one, you see, was very simple. 
Those following became a little more 
elaborate; for instance, the record for 
Friday, April 7, 1911, is, 
Guests: Mr. and Mrs. Brown and small 

son, James. 
Centerpiece: Home grown violets. 

Menu 

Clear Soup Crackers 

Roast Leg of Lamb (stufifed) 

Mashed Potatoes Baked Cauliflower 

Brown Bread 

Lettuce Salad French Dressing Cheese Fingers 

Steamed Chocolate Pudding Cream Sa«ce 

Coffee 

Another, Friday, May 5, 1911. 
Guests: Mr. and Mrs. Charles. 
Centerpiece: Blue myrtle and daisies. 

Menu 

Cream of Tomato Soup Croutons 

Panned Chicken Asparagus Mashed Potatoes 

Lettuce, Tomato, Radish Salad 

Mayonnaise Dressing 

Brown Bread

27, 1911. 

Guests: Mr. and Mrs. Smith and small 

daughter. 
Centerpiece: Pansies and daisies. 

Menu 

Tomato Soup Crackers 
Roast Leg of Lamb Mint Sauce 

Creamed New Potatoes 
New Peas in Turnip Cups 
Radish and Lettuce Salad 

Brown Bread Sandwiches 
Fresh Strawberries and Cream Sunshine Cake 

Coffee 

I recall that at one of the first of these 
dinners I put the French dressing on the 
lettuce before the meal was served and, 
of course, by the time it was to be eaten 
it was quite wilted. Since that exper- 
ience I know positively that such a salad 
must not be mixed until just before it is 
served. Again, on one occasion when I 



served Maryland chicken, while I cooked 
the chicken even a trifle longer than the 
recipe advised, it was not quite as tender 
as it should have been. From my own 
experience I learned that chicken should 
be cooked as long as that particular 
chicken needs cooking or until it is ten- 
der, regardless as to whether the cobk 
book says a longer or shorter time. 
Now, too, I can judge quite accurately as 
to what amount will be required for any 
small number of persons, and I am less 
apt to worry that there won't be quite 
enough. 

On the whole, we considered our experi- 
ment as an unusually successful one, one 
that gave us a great deal of real pleasure 
as well as experience that has since proved 
to be invaluable. 



The Making of Woman 



In ** The Independent. 



ft 



When now the high gods had perfected man^ 
The making then of woman they began; 
But no material durable was left, 
So from the slight and subtle she was weft. 

And they took counsel; for her soul was drawn 
The mystery and the moment of the dawn. 
And for her fragile face they sagely took 
The primrose opening pale with upward look; 
And for her motion stayed a fleeting star, 
Therefore so bright she seems and so afar! 

They gave her the first leap of the loosed deer, 
Then rustling secret of the fringe mere, 
And elfin mischief of the guilty glade. 
Lighting whereon a mortal grows afraid. — 
The dance of fays upon illumined bank, 
The frolic and the freak, and moonshine prank. 

The tremble of first dew upon the grass, 
The yearning of the moon as she doth pass; 
Then the suspense of the o'erbrimming billow 
And dream of noon-breeze upon wild-flower 

pillow. 
They gave her golden music's dyin^ strain, 
The quiet prattling mercy of the rain. 

They stole her heavy sorrow from the sea. 
And yet from running brooks their laughing glee, 
And thus with subtle touch and yet most sure. 
They fashioned a frail thing that shall endure.

Welcome and Unwelcome Guests 

By Mary H. Tufts 



IT requires as much tact and common 
sense to be an agreeable guest, as it 
does to be an agreeable hostess. 

Many of the bugbears of entertaining 
arise from the thoughtlessness or incon- 
siderateness of guests. 

One of the most important facts to re- 
member is that uninvited, unannounced 
guests are seldom welcome. 

The hostess and her family must neces- 
sarily make certain changes in their daily 
routine, for the pleasiu-e and comfort of 
guests; and they should always have the 
privilege of knowing when to expect 
guests, so that they may make these 
changes and plans at the least possible 
inconvenience to themselves. 

The prospective guest should always 
consult his hostess as to the most con- 
venient time for a visit; and, once the 
plans are made, should not break the 
engagement, except for reason of illness, 
or other unforeseen circumstances which 
absolutely prevent making the visit at 
the time planned for. 

The guest, who comes unannounced, 
often finds that the house-wife already 
has a number of guests ; or that illness in 
the family, or other circumstances make 
a guest a burden. 

The thoughtful person will not plan to 
visit on farms during the very busy sea- 
sons of haying or harvesting; for at these 
times, unless plenty of help is employed 
indoors (and it seldom is), entertaining 
cannot help being burdensome. 

There is a class of people who make 
"visits of convenience," so-called. They 
wish, perhaps, to go to an adjoining city 
or town to do shopping, have dentistry 
done, or to visit the dressmaker. So, for 
their own convenience and interests, 
they plan to visit some acquaintance or 
friend. In other words, they make use 
of the home of the friend or acquaintance, 
as they would a hotel or restaurant. 



Perhaps they are, also, anxious to save 
hotel bills, and therefore depend upon the 
friend for this hospitality. 

In the coimtry, also, to some extent, 
there exists the custom of visiting among 
persons whose parents, or some more 
remote ancestors have had some business 
dealings or chance acquaintance with 
one another. Not long ago a friend of 
mine was visited by a family of four, from 
a distant place, because, as they said, — 
"We used to know yotir grandfather; and 
worked for him when we were first mar- 
ried.'* So, perforce, my friend enter- 
tained them for a week, at great incon- 
venience; though she had never before 
even heard of them; much less did she 
owe them social favors. 

Happily for the modem hostess, this 
old-time code of hospitality is giving way 
to a more sane and agreeable one. The 
laws of good society and politeness now 
permit her to entertain whoever, and 
whenever she pleases. She is not ex- 
pected, by reasonable or sensible people, 
to entertain other than friends, or those 
to whom she is indebted in a social way. 

Visiting in a servantless household, 
one may often aid the hostess in light 
household duties; or, if there are chil- 
dren in the family, may entertain them 
for a little while each day. Thus, while 
leaving your hostess to attend to neces- 
sary household duties, you may, also, 
pass the time pleasantly, and aid her at 
the same time. 

However, the guest should be careful 
not to introduce games or pastimes, which 
would be the means of soiling or injuring 
the children's clothing; thereby proving 
a hindrance rather than a help to the 
mother. Neither should a guest give 
children candy, or other edibles, unless 
she is siu"e the mother is willing. 

Comparatively few women enjoy hav- 
ing a guest watch them about the cook-

ing or other housework; therefore it is 
well to keep out of the kitchen or culin- 
ary department, unless one is specially 
invited to be there. 

Some people show the utmost 
thoughtlessness in visiting, in their use 
of the furnishings of their room. It 
certainly is very vexing and disheartening 
for a careful housekeeper to have bedding 
and furniture carelessly injured by guests 

Not long ago a friend told me that a 
recent guest had stained every nice 
damask and huck towel in the guest- 
room, with greasy cosmetic salves and 
lotions. This same guest also had the 
habit of lying on the bed with boots on, 
and with the spread or the white wool 
blankets unprotected from soiling by 
boots and clothing. The consequence 
was that the hostess was obliged to wash 
two pairs of very dirty, white, wool 
blankets after the guest's departure; 
though the blankets had been laundered 
but a short time before. 

Fruit and ink-stains on bedding or 
table-covers are, except in occasional 
instances, needless; and the guests who 
are heedless in this respect cannot ex- 
pect to be gladly entertained in the 
average household. 

Every family will appreciate the tact 
of the guest who absents himself from the 
family circle for a time each day, so that 
they may talk over family or business 
plans, in private. 

The greatest care should be exercised 
by guests not to make unnecessary or 
untimely demands upon the business- 
hours of families in which they visit. 
With many people it must nearly always 
be "Business before pleasure;** and inter- 
ruptions during business-hours are not 
only an annoyance, but may mean con- 
siderable financial loss as well. 

It is very inconsiderate to visit a friend 
who is preparing for a journey; imless, 
perhaps, there are servants to do the 
packing and other preparations. 

If it is unavoidable that a guest arrive 



at mealtime, or after regular mealtime, 
it is a courtesy to get that meal on the 
dining-car, or at a hotel or restaurant; 
but the hostess should be informed in 
advance of such an intention; so that she 
may not be put to the trouble of prepar- 
ing an extra meal, or of keeping a meal 
waiting. It has been said that the pres- 
ent generation is a *'Set of Pood-Cranks." 
I am not prepared to argue that topic; 
but would say that a guest should not 
make his hostess feel that she is to cater 
for a '* Health-Food Sanitarium." Nor 
should he manifest disappointment or 
dissatisfaction with such food and enter- 
tainment as his hostess is able to provide. 

Servants should be treated most 
politely ; and only necessary services asked 
of them. 

Nearly every year a family of city 
people visits one of my friends who reside 
in the country. They make so many 
demands of the one servant employed, 
that it is difficult to get a servant for 
more than one season, if it is known that 
this family is to visit her. 

Guests should not expect, or allow, 
their personal clothing to be laundered 
in the home in which they are visiting; 
even though their hostess may, through 
courtesy, offer to have it done. 

Unpleasant and embarrassing things 
may happen in the best-regulated house- 
holds. The tactful guest is apparently 
oblivious to such incidents; or, at least, 
is discreetly tolerant of them. 

One should not accept hospitality, and 
then criticise those who have bestowed it. 

If other guests are present, one should 
make himself as agreeable as possible to 
them. 

In other words, the welcome guest is he 
who enters, unobtrusively, into the pleas- 
tires and interests of the family in which 
he visits ; but is careful not to meddle in 
family affairs, which do not concern him, 
nor thoughtlessly or carelessly to cause 
inconvenience in the family. Courtesy 
is a virtue.

A Prayer for Beauty 

In " The Forum:* 

Give her such beauty of body and mind 

As the leaves of an aspen-tree 
When they vary from silver to green in the wind, 

And who shall be lovely as she? 
Then give her the favor of harking to love 

As the heart of a wood to the call of a dove! 
And give her the beauty of following free 

As the cloud in the sky or a wave in the sea! 

Give her such purity vivid with light 

As the wonder of passion can be, 
Aware in the day and rapt in the night, 

And none shall be lovely as she! 
O give her the fortune a lover may find 

In the sharing of beauty of body and mind, 
The paramount beauty of giving, that she 

May immortally give it! — but give her to me! 

By Witter Bynnbr. 



TO OUR READERS 

A SUBSCRIPTION to the Cooking 
School Magazine should be re- 
garded as a prudent investment. As an 
essential part of the housewife *s equipment 
it has special fitness. The Hotel World 
and The Caterer are special publications 
for hotel keepers. Both in text and 
advertising matter these periodicals ap- 
peal to the interests of those who cater 
to the traveling public. In like manner 
the Cooking- School Maga/ine is 
adapted especially to the needs of the 
general housewife everywhere. 

We wish to invite your attention 
once more to the fact that the price of 
this periodical has not been changed. 
Other publications, with scarcely an 
exception, have increased their price 
of subscription, to keep pace with the 
constantly rising price of everything 
else. A few days ago the prosperous 
farmer in Maine, who for a long time 
has furnished us butter at a fixed price, 
wrote that on account of the general 
shortage in crops he must advance the 
price of butter five cents per pound. We 
accepted, for the goods were worth the 
increase. But it occurred to us that, 
though the cost of everything that goes 
into the contents and make-up of this 
publication has been largely increased, 
no one has ever suggested that a rise in 
the price of a yearly subscription would 
be agreeable. At any rate, we propose 
to stick to our price unless unforseen 
conditions arise. 

In the meantime, help us give you a 
better publication by renewing your own 
subscription promptly and by putting, 
occasionally, a copy of the magazine into 
the hands of some friend or neighbor 
who may wish to subscribe. Your sub- 
scriptions provide only a part of the 
means we need, to attain results com- 
mensurate with your wants. Help us, 
also, by patronizing our advertisers. 
Only special, first-class, guaranteed art- 
icles find a place on our advertising pages. ' 
The fact that you buy and use the goods

there represented, as you are able to do 
so, is the sole inducement for these 
people to give us a share of their adver- 
tising business. You can do much to 
cause them to think well of us, and, 
at the same time, receive siire good to 
yourdves. 

Do not, except for good and sufficient 
reason, discontinue your subscription at 
this time because of high prices, the 
cost of livingi and a desire to reduce 
expenses. This magazine deals ex- 
pressly with matters of economy and 
should be of constant value to you. 
The good health of your family is to be 
put first in consideration. Look out 
for the realization of sound health; it 
comes largely from fresh air and proper, 
wholesome feeding. 

WOMAN'S AFFAIRS 

WOMAN'S affairs are rapidly com- 
ing into prominence. Her place 
and part in a progressive civilization is 
the subject of greatest concern today, 
and especially the interest in Domestic 
Science is steadily growing and spreading 
far and wide. We are just beginning 
to see how many branches the subject 
has and how significant and far-reaching 
it is in scope. Even the importance of 
good cooking, for instance, can not be 
over-estimated. As recently stated by 
an English writer of note, **A good cook 
should know much about food, as well 
as cooking, and should also know some- 
thing of physiology. How few are 
really conversant with either food values 
or the digestibility, of foods, and yet, 
to a knowledge of both, has to be added 
a broad common sense, for there are no 
fixed and definite rules that can be safely 
followed. There are foods which may 
easily be digested by some and are quite 
indigestible to others, while one style of 
cooking may suit certain people and 
quite upset others. It is not difficult 
however, with a good, sound, general 
knowledge to accommodate any of 
these various idiosyncrasies to individ- 
ual requirements. 



Cooking may also be a high art as 
well as a science, for it appeals to the 
three senses of sight, taste and smell. 
The appetite, and even the digestion, 
is stimulated when art is applied, and 
no cook can be said to have attained a 
high place who is not an artist. Color 
and decoration enter very largely into 
the effect and value, as well as the 
appearance of what we eat, therefore 
these deserve to be carefully studied. 

It is almost impossible to over-rate 
the importance of good cooking. It 
promotes health and energy and, as 
an economic factot*, its value can hardly 
be expressed in gold, but it also goes so 
far to promote the happiness of our 
homes that it is very difficult to appre- 
ciate why such an art has been so long 
neglected. 

Another very tangible reason why 
cooking should be studied is that it 
pays. Good cooks are in demand, 
and are likely to be in greater demand 
in the future, and if the emolument 
is not high, at present, the reason is not 
far to seek, for we must, in fairness, 
recognise that the ability, either, is 
not high. The remuneration is certain 
to rise with the standard of fitness.*' 

THE CALL TO PATRIOTISM 

As It Comes to the American Houswife 

TO view properly a picture one has 
to stand at a distance from it to 
get its perspective. So it is with history 
One must look back through the years 
to distinguish events and people in their 
real importance. The makers of our 
country did not see themselves in the 
heroic light of the future. Their lives 
were full of hard, monotonous, unroman- 
tic toil. 

Few of us are called to pack up our 
cherished pieces of family mahogany 
and fine china to go a-pioneering. Let 
us hope that increasingly few of us are 
called to bear and rear sons to be shot 
down by the bullets of war. Was there, 
however, ever an age which called more 
loudly for living for one's country?

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



Pure milk, untainted meat, full weight 
from the grocer, "swat the fly," are 
subjects which, perhaps, do not sound 
as romantic as fighting Indians and 
pioneering, but they are, undoubtedly 
just as romantic in real living. 

Whatever else the children of the 
future may see as they look back at these 
eariy years of the twentieth century, 
we may be sure that the woman ques- 
tion will stand out from the background. 
Woman in political life, woman in the 
industrial world, woman in her relation 
to the high cost of living . . . almost all 
the questions of the day before our 
nation have to do with the woman 
problem. Think you that the question 
of the cost of living would take the place 
that it now does in our national political 
life, if women had shown the same 
efficiency in eliminating waste from the 
home that men have shown in elimi- 
nating waste from business. Many an 
otherwise intelligent woman thinks that 
it is niggardly to look out for waste in 
her own kitchen. Many a woman 
wishes that she might earn an income 
outside her home and never thinks of 
the money she might acquire within 
the home by eliminating waste. 

In America during the late decades 
it has been the custom to educate the 
children of the family who showed signs 
of brains and ability, away from country 
life. Compare the forestry and agri- 
culture of Germany, where thought and 
intelligence are applied to every square 
inch of land. The results are wonder- 
ful. America is just beginning to open 
her eyes. In the same way that she 
is beginning to see the need of intelli- 
gence in forestry and agriculture so, 
too, is she beginning to see the need of 
the same in the home. Time was when 
the woman with gifts scorned to use 
them in her daily household tasks. 
These were a thing apart, and her 
methods of housekeeping and household 
management were as unsuited to her 
present day needs as her grandmother's 
one silk gown to her more complex 



social demands of the present day. 

The call to the patriotic women of 
the land is sounding loudly American 
courtesy and taste, American marriages 
and family life, American housewives, 
are acquiring disrepute among the 
nations of the world. Many of the 
criticisms are unjust, perhaps, yet is not 
the very fact that they are uttered a 
challenge to every thinking woman who 
would keep alive in our land the high 
standards which are our inheritance? 
Is there anything more needed in our 
land than the intelligent housewife, 
willing to put into her task of home- 
making the same amount of care and 
thought which her husband puts into 
his profession? It is a work worthy of 
woman's best gifts. e. s. e. 



It has long been conceded that all 
progressive races are well-fed. The 
French have long excelled in culinary 
matters as well as in thriftiness. They 
have paid enormous taxes and indem- 
nities and are now foremost among the 
bankers for the world. They seem to 
have acquired, by long practice, the 
habit of economy, of eliminating waste 
and making a little go far. And herein, 
perhaps, lies the secret of the future 
prosperity and well-being of civilized 
nations. 

How to cultivate the small garden 
and how to utilize and make the most 
of every thing so produced is a matter 
of vital impprtance to masses of people 
everywhere. How to make plain, simple 
dishes palatable and nourishing is the 
great desideratum in the culinary art, 
the last word that defines the frugal, 
thrifty housewife. 



After all we are living in really pros- 
perous times. The harvest ,in general, 
has been good. Neither famine nor 
war threatens. People who want to 
work are employed, while business of 
all kinds seems everywhere in flourishing 
condition. 



Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 

T N all recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after 
-*- sifting once. Where flour is measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a 
level cupful is meant. A tablespoonful or teaspoonful of any designated material is a 
LEVEL spoonful. 



Anchovy- and- Egg Canapes 

ROLL trimmings of puff paste, left 
after cutting out patties or a vol- 
au-vent, to a little less than one- 
fourth an inch in thickness, and stamp 
out with a sharp cutter.dipped in boiling 
water, into diamond or other shapes. 
Chill and bake till done. Beat one-third 
a cup of butter to a cream and gradually 
beat in enough anchovy paste to tint and 



flavor as desired. When the pufE-paste 
shapes are chilled, spread slightly with 
the paste, set a slice of hard-cooked egg 
in the center of each, and pipe paste on 
the edge of the "crust;" finish with a 
figure, cut from a shoe of truffle or 
pickled beet, at the center of the egg, and 
fine-chopped truffle or beet in the open 
spaces. If truffle be used, dip the slices 
of egg in French dressing before setting 
them in place. Serve as a first course

Sauce 

The cut of a large fish just back of 
the head is thought to be the best for 
boiling or steaming. Set the fish on a 
rack in a steam kettle, the piece is thick 
(comparatively) and will take about six 
minutes per pound to cook. A large 
quantity of water is unnecessary; this 
should be lukewarm that the skin o£ the 
'fish may not contract. Dress on a 
napkin (to absorb the liquid). Surround 
the fish with hot, boiled or steamed pota- 
toes of uniform size. Serve oyster sauce 
in a bowl apart.

Pour boiling water into an iron frying 
pan; add about a teaspoonful of salt; 
break in one or more strictly fresh eggs. 
Add more water, if necessary, that the 
eggs may be covered. Do not allow the 
water to boil during the cooking. As 
soon as an egg seems "set" on the bot- 
tom, run a spatula beneath it, that it 
may float in the water. Have ready a 
round of toast for each egg; spread the 
toast with butter, lightly, and then with

to keep every portion moist and juicy. 
For the croquettes cook three-fourths a 
cup of blanched rice in about two and 
a half cups of milk or broth, or part 
tomato purte and part broth. If broth 
be used, add a tablespoonful, each, of 
chopped green or red pepper, and of 
onion yellowed in two tablespoonful s of 
butter, with the broth. Season with 
salt and paprika. More liquid may be 
needed. The rice should be quite moist 
when done. Turn on to a buttered plate 
and when cooled somewhat form into 
balls or other shapes. Egg-and-bread

teaspoonful of baking powder, and, 
lastly, the whites of four eggs, beaten 
dry. Bake in a loaf nearly one hour. 
When cold, cover with confectioner's 
frosting, then decorate with ornamental 
frosting, putting it in place with bag and 
tube, and a sugar cupid. 

Confectioner's Frosting 

Boil one-fourth a cup, each, of sugar 
and water about three minutes, then beat 
in sifted confectioner's sugttr, to make a 
frosting that will remain in place on the 
cake. 

Ornamental Frosting 

(Mm. JohDion) 
Boil one cup of sugar and one-half a 
cup of boiling water to 240. F. Stir the 
sugar and water until the sugar is melted, 
cover and let boil rapidly three or four 
minutes, — to wash down the grains of 



sugar — then put in the thermometer 
and cook as above. Have ready the 
white of one egg, about half-beaten; 
pour in the syrup very gradually — 
through a strainer — beating constantly, 
meanwhile. When all the syrup has 
been beaten in and the frosting is quite 
cool, beat in one teaspoonful of lemon 
juice. When cold the frosting will hold 
its shape perfectly, and flow smoothly 
and freely through a tube. The cake 
shown in the illustration was decorated 
with a leaf-tube. The frosting was tinted 
delicately, but not evenly, with a little 
rose-leaf color paste and was put on to 
simulate roses and a bow knot. The 
top is finished with a cupid — bought at 
a confectioner's, the base surrounded 
with white asteroids. If the frosting 
can not be used at once, cover the top 
of the bowl with a damp cloth. This 
frosting works well. 

Puff Paste 
Weigh out half a pound (one cup) of 
butter and half a pound (two cups) of 
pastry flour. Put two tablespoonfuls of 
the flour into a dredger for use when 
rolling the paste. Add one-fourth a 
teaspoonful of salt to the rest of the 
flour. Rinse an earthen bowl and a 
wooden spoon, or the hands, in hot water, 
then in cold, letting cold water, changed

once or twice, stand in the bowl some 
time, or until the bowl is chilled. Then 
refill the bowl with cold water, and in 
it work the butter, with the hand or 
spoon, until it is pliable and waxy 
throughout. Then pat it into a thin 
rectangular cake. 

Take off about two tablespoonfuls of 
the butter, and set the rest aside in a 
cool place until ready to use. 

With the tips of the fingers or a knife 
work the two tablespoonftds of butter 
into the flour and salt. Then gradually 
add cold water, and mix the whole to a 
paste. About three-fourths a cup of 
water will be needed. The paste should 
be of such a consistency that it does not 
stick when kneaded. 

Dredge a magic cover (used on board 
and pin) lightly with flour and work it 
in thoroughly. Then knead the little 
ball of dough until it is elastic. Cover 
it with the mixing-bowl, and let **rest*' 
five minutes. Then pat it with the 
rolling-pin and roll into a rectangular 
sheet. 

Have the sheet of paste a little more 
than twice the width and three times 
the length of the cake of butter. 

Set the butter in the middle of one- 
half the paste, the greatest length of the 
butter over the greatest length of the 
paste. Then turn the paste lengthwise 
over the butter, thus folding the paste 
in the center, lengthwise, and enclosing 
the butter. Press the three open edges 
of paste together, to include the air. 
Then fold one end of the paste over and 
the other under the butter. There 
will now be three layers of paste over 
and three under the layer of butter. 
Press the edges of paste together firmly. 

Now turn the paste around, in order 
to roll the sheet of paste in a direction 
opposite to the first rolling. Let "rest" 
about five minutes. Then pat gently 



with the pin, to press the paste together 
in ridges and break up the enclosed air 
into smaller bubbles. Roll the paste 
into a long strip, taking pains to roll the 
butter between the layers of paste and 
without letting the paste break through 
to the butter. Keep the edges even. 
Fold the paste, to make three even 
layers, with edges perfectly straight. 
Then turn the paste half-way around, so 
as to roll in the opposite direction. Let 
**rest** a few minutes. Then pat and 
roll into a sheet as before. Fold to 
make three layers. Turn half-way 
around. Pat and roll out as before. 

Continue folding, turning, and rolling 
until the paste 'has been rolled out six 
times. Begin counting with the first 
rolling after the butter has been added. 
When rolling the sixth time, shape the 
paste for the article or articles to be 
cut from it. 

For a vol-au-vent roll the paste to 
such thickness that two pieces the size 
of the vol-au-vent cutter may be cut 
from it. Dip the cutter in boiling water 
and stamp out the two pieces; cut each 
piece again about three-fourths an inch 
from the edge ; cut one piece half through, 
the other, for the upper piece, three- 
quarters through; brush the lower piece 
with cold water and set the other above 
it; cut out small figures, brush the under 
side with cold water and use to decorate 
the center of the top. Let chill on ice 
half an hour; bake about forty minutes; 
cut out the center and remove uncooked 
paste if present. The oven shotdd be 
hot on the bottom to send up the paste. 
Cover the top with brown paper if 
necessary. For the vol-au-vent shown 
in the illustration a cutter seven inches 
by four and a quarter was used. A large 
cutter gives a lower case and one easier 
to bake.

On Saturday evening the potatoes for 
the fish balls are pared and put into 
cold water; the fish is picked in small 
pieces and set into another dish of cold 
water. Four slices of bacon are rolled, 
separately, and a wooden tooth-pick 
run through each to hold it in shape. 
The package of wheat, double-boiler 
and measuring cup are set on the table 
or shelf near the range. In the morning, 
as soon as the tea kettle boils, put a 
quart of boiling water and a teaspoonful 
■ of salt into the upper part of the double- 
boiler, and put directly over the fire; 
when the water again boils, take a cup 
of the wheat and stir while gradually 
sprinkling it into the water; let boil 
vigorously about five minutes, then set 
into the other part of the boiler, over 



boiling water, to cook until breakfast is 
ready. Pour boiling water over the 
potatoes (cut into halves or quarters), 
drain the fish and set it above and at the 
center of the potatoes, cover and let 
cook until the potatoes are tender 
(one pint of potato, one cup of fish). 

Meanwhile, set the Scotch bowl with 
fat for frying over the fire, that the fat 
may melt and become hot. Take care 
that it does not become overheated, 
as that will spoil it. Fat for frying fish 
cakes or potatoes should not have been 
used very many times for frying or the 
color of the finished article will be 
muddy, rather than a clean amber tint. 

Drain the water from the fish and 
potatoes, shake the fish from the potato 
and press the potato through the ricer; 
add the fish, a dash of black pepper, 
^n egg, beaten light, and a little salt, 
if needed; with a wooden spoon beat 
the mixture very light ; then shape with 
a spoon and the hands into about one 
dozen balls. Do not press the mixture 
together too firmly. Test the fat with 
a bit of bread; it should brown while 
fifty is being counted as the clock ticks. 
Put in the bacon, when well cooked 
skim out on to tissue paper to drain and 
put in one-third of the fish cakes. 
You may lower them into the fat in a 
frying basket — first immersed in the 
fat that the cakes may not stick to it — 



THREE MEALS A DAY 



301 



or you may set them on a skimjoier and 
let them slide from that into the fat. 
When of a delicate amber tint, raise 
the basket, drain and then pick out 
the fish balls wth the fingers and set 
them on tissue paper; or, using no 
basket, lift them out on the skimmer, 
drain and slide them to a dish holding 
tissue paper, crushed and made hot to 
receive them. While the fish balls 
are frying, the Parker House rolls, 
fastened securely in a paper bag of the 
kind used for cooking purposes, have 
been reheating in the oven, the coffee 
has been boiling and the cocoa gently 
simmering, and breakfast is now ready. 
Move the coffee back where it will 
simmer slightly, and the cocoa where 
it will keep hot without simmering. 
Put a paper napkin on a serving dish, 
and on this dispose the fish cakes and 
bacon and set the dish into the warming 
oven. Set the fat aside to cool a little. 
Turn the wheat into a hot dish and serve 
at once. After the cereal is eaten, take 
out the used dishes etc., and bring in the 
rest of the breakfast. 

To make the coffee, three tablespoons- 
ful of coffee was stirred with the crushed 
shell of the egg (used for the fish balls) 
and a little cold water, then when the 
fish balls were ready to fry, two cups 
and three-fourths of boiling water were 
poured on and the coffee set to boil. 
For two cups of cocoa two rounding 
teaspoonsful of cocoa and four rounding 
teaspoonsftd of sugar were set to cook 
in about one cup and a half of boiling 
water. Cream or milk, scalded in a 
double boiler, are added, at pleasure, 
at the table to both the coffee and cocoa. 
Two quarts of milk are purchased daily 
and the cream is used for the morning 
cereal or such other purpose as seems 
best for the day in question. 

Breakfast being over, the rest of the 
wheat (only one-half was taken up for 
breakfast) is turned into an empty 
coffee or baking-powder can to fry as 
mush, Monday morning. Put a strainer 
holding a piece of cheese doth into a 



receptacle and pour in the fat from the 
Scotch bowl, wipe out the bowl with the 
tissue paper on which the fish cakes 
were drained (bum the paper), wash the 
bowl, outside and in, in hot soapy water, 
rinse and make dry, then to it retimi the 
fat, and set it aside ready to use for some 
other purpose. 

On Saturday the fowl was cut in pieces 
at the joints, covered with boiling water 
and after ten minutes boiling was sim- 
mered until tender; the pieces of flesh 
were set aside in one dish, and the 
broth in another. One quart of cran-' 
berries were cooked, covered, about five 
minutes in boiling water, pressed through 
a gravy str^ner with a wooden pestle 
(a matter of five minutes if the right 
sort of a sieve is used) and, without 
rettUTiing the pulp to the fire, two cups 
of sugar are stirred in, and the mixture 
turned into a mold. If these directions 
are followed on Saturday, cranberry 
jelly is assiu-ed for Sunday. If a jelly- 
like sauce, not as firm as jelly, be pre- 
ferred, use two cups of water, keeping the 
proportions of the other ingredients the 
same. 

The Parker House rolls, reheated for 
breakfast and supper, were made on 
Sattu-day. The recipe (with illustration) 
appears in the October number of 
this magazine. Enthusiastic cooking 
teachers, obliged to give yeast rolls in 
the time devoted to a lesson, claim that 
one point in this recipe is of inestimable 
value to them. Indeed, no one, teacher 
or housekeeper, should ever attempt 
to make these rolls who does not grasp 
this point. Its use marks the dividing line 
between efficiency and inefficiency. Here 
it is: — when the dough is light and ready 
to shape, carefully — without disturbing 
it in the least — turn it upside down on 
the board, very lightly dredged with 
flour; pat it with the pin, then roll with 
a few long strokes into a sheet less than 
half an inch thick, then cut into rounds 
and finish as in the recipe. The undis- 
turbed dough may be rolled into a thin 
sheet with the fewest motions imagin-

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



able; try it once, and Parker House rolls 
will have no further terrors for you. 
Do not forget to lift the dough from the 
board before cutting out the rounds; 
this insures no "flying back" of the same 
after they are cut. Properly reheated, 
these rolls are about, if not quite, equal 
to the fresh baked. 

The pastry for the apple pie was made 
on Saturday, then on Sunday morning it 
will take but a short time to get the pie 
ready for the oven. At this season of 
the year, pastry keeps well and paste 
for two pies may be made on Sattu^day 
and a second pie be prepared the middle 
of the week. For the pastry, take three 
cups of pastry (not bread) flour, six 
ounces or three-fourths a cup of short- 
ening, half a teaspoonful, each, of salt 
and baking powder, and cold water as 
needed (rather less than three-fourths 
a cup). Sift together the dry ingre- 
dients; with two knives cut in the short- 
ening, then, adding the water, gradually, 
mix to a paste; cut and mix with the 
knife until the paste cleans the bowl; 
cover and set aside in a cool place until 
time to make the pie. After breakfast, 
Sunday, pare, quarter, core and slice 
the apples, measure out a cup of sugar, 
half a teaspoonful of salt and a table- 
spoonful of butter; take rather more 
than one-fourth of the paste on a board, 
lightly dredged with flour, roll with a 
knife in the flour, knead slightly, 
then pat and roll out to fit the pan; 
lift the paste several times while rolling 
to be sure it is not sticking to the board; 
also dredge the board lightly with flour 
as needed. Lift the paste to the plate — 
an agate one is preferable — fit it 
closely, yet loosely, against the plate 
then cut all around one-fourth an inch 
beyond the edge of the plate. In baking, 
the paste will shrink and come just to 
the edge of the plate. Roll out the 
upper crust, and make several slits 
in the center. Now, both crusts being 



ready, fill the prepared plate with the 
apples, sprinkle on the sugar, salt and 
a little nutmeg or mace as is desired. 
Add the butter in bits, brush the edge 
with cold water and turn two or three 
tablespoonsful over the apples. Lift 
the upper paste into place, let it lie 
loosely over the apples, then cut even 
with the under paste; brush the two 
edges of paste together with water; 
keep them together and away from the 
plate. Set into an over hot on the 
bottom and let bake from twenty-five 
to thirty-five minutes. The oven should 
be hot, at first, to bake the pastry before 
it becomes soaked, after that reduce the 
heat that the pastry be not too dark 
in color. 

At dinner time set the apples to 
bake for supper, and the potatoes and 
squash to boil; try out fat from bits 
of fat salt pork; dip the second joints, 
legs, and breast, cut in four pieces, in 
part of the broth made hot, then roll 
in flour and let brown in the hot fat, 
first on one side and then on the other. 
Stir floiu", salt and black pepper with 
cold water to a smooth paste, dilute 
with some of the hot broth and stir 
the whole over the fire until boiling. 
Let simmer imtil dinner is ready; 
if fat rises remove with tissue paper. 
When dinner is ready to serve, set the 
tea kettle over the fire with fresh water 
and make the tea when removing the 
plates, before serving the pie. Have 
the tea pot scalded and hot that there 
be no delay. The recipe for the cookies 
fmade on Saturday) will be found in the 
seasonable recipes. These will last 
about one week. The mashed potato, 
chicken (broth and meat) and squash, 
left over, will be made use of in the next 
chapter? 

Note: — The days taken uf) from month to 
month are supposed to be continuous; the food 
left over from the meals in one month will be 
accounted for in the next month. — Editor,

Lunches for School Children 

POSSIBLY some of the readers of 
this magazine liave the same prob- 
lem to solve as myself, namely, 
furnishing a good, substantial and nour- 
ishing luncheon, at a moderate cost, 
for school children and adults. 

Often in poring over cook books 
in search of some dish to vary the 
menu, I was met with the difficulty 
of procuring some ingredient, as, for 
instance, most recipes for pur^s call 
for the addition of a quantity of soup 
stock. In kitchens where daily soup 
is not the rule, it would be quite an 
undertaking for a housewife with limited 
time at her command to first prepare the 
stock and then the pur^. 

A very savory soup, which is hearty 
enough for the main dish at luncheon, 
can be made from dried Lima beans 
in the following manner: Let soak over 
night the required quantity of beans 
(3 cups will serve seven or eight jreople) ; 
then place over the fire with plenty of 
water to prevent burning, a few bones 
from a roast or pieces of steak from 
dinner the night before, or a small 
left-over portion of stew, or a cup of 
gravy from a pot roast, and a few soup 
vegetables, whatever one has at hand, 
a couple of tomatoes, top of celery, a 
carrot or turnip, sprig of parsley, etc., 
simmered until very soft, then pressed 
through a colander, reheated and served 
with heated crackers or croutons. 

This, with a green salad or.^apple 
sauce and bread and butter, makes a 



very satisfactory luncheon and one 
imusually relished. 

The peas I use are not the split var- 
iety, but whole,green,dried peas. They 
are soaked in the same manner as the 
beans, cooked till soft, pressed through 
the colander and placed over the fire. 
Make a roiut of butter and flour; add 
a little of the purfc, and when smooth, 
add it to the rest and allow to boil up. 
This holds the particles of peas in susr 
pension and seasons the soup. It is not 
necessary with the Lima beans. During 
the winter and early spring, no other 
seasoning is needed, but later on it is 
desirable to cook a smaU piece of salt 
pork or a few bones from a roast with 
them. 

A soup can be made in either of the 
foregoing ways from lentils, but I have 
not succeeded in making it so palatable. 

By varying the seasoning for the 
bean and lentil soups, slightly, as, for 
instance, at one time let the celery 
flavor predominate and at another time 
the tomato, or omitting either or both, 
an agreeable variety can be obtained. 

Macaroni baked with cheese, laid on 
in thin shces, so as to form a crust, (for 
variety use tomato Vpurfee instead of 
milk, or season in the*Italian fashion) 
furnishes the hearty dish for another 
luncheon. (.. T. O. 

Garments for Outdoor Sports 

THE child, whether boy or girl, who 
is to grow up into a rightful heri- 
tage of good health must leant to 



304 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



play out of doors in the coldest of wea- 
ther. In order, however, for the child 
to enjoy the out-door life in very cold 
weather, he must be comfortable and 
the mother, looking for the best good of 
her children, gives much thought to the 
problem. Probably no better suit has 
yet been brought out than the *' Eskimo.** 
These are practical, comfortable, inex- 
pensive and can be made at home by any 
mother who makes or superintends the 
making of her children's clothing. The 
material is a pair of gray wool blankets. 
This color is chosen because they soil less 
than more delicate colors. The gar- 
ments are a pair of loose bloomers and a 
jacket, with a hood attached at the 
throat line. These are cut precisely the 
same for the boy as for the girl and are 
worn over the regular underwear, the 
girls, of course, dispensing with petti- 
coats. Usually the jacket is cut from 
one end of a blanket, so that the blue or 
black border is left on the lower part of 
the garment making a really attractive 
finish. With these garments are worn 
high gaiters over woolen stockings and 
felt shoes. 

This is the costiune worn in the open- 
air rooms where children who show ten- 
dencies toward heart-weakness, anaemia 
or tuberculosis are helped to overcome 
these diseases, but it is just as practical 
for every boy and girl and is being adop- 
ted by boy-scouts, camp-fire girls and 
other clubs. It gives the boy or girl 
absolute protection from the cold or 
storm and leaves the limbs perfectly 
free to participate in any game. 

Decorating the Tea Table 

One of the newest ideas for decorating 
the tea table, and a very pretty one it is, 
uses several bouquets of the same kind 
of flowers. Suppose it is an afternoon 
function at a woman's club, at which 
light refreshments are to be served. 
Place in the centre of the table a basket 
of delicate pink roses. Leaving room 
for an irregular row of sandwiches or 
cakes, place a row of small high, glass 



vases filled with the same kind of roses 
arotmd the plates of food. These latter 
vases should hold not more than three or 
four roses. These small vases should not 
be placed stiffly, but arranged carelessly, 
although keeping the idea of a circle or 
an oval. Connect the vases with one 
wide, or two-inch wide, lengths of rib- 
bon as nearly the shade of the roses as 
possible, and at each comer of the table, 
so placed as not to be an inconvenience 
either to the potirers or servers, place a 
lighted candle screened by a silver can- 
dle shade fringed with pink. This 
makes a very beautiful table; but just 
as artistic wotild be a design of butter- 
cups, when they may be had for the 
picking, the vases, prefereably low ones, 
covered with yellow tissue paper and 
connected with ropes of the same paper. 
The latter decoration would mean no 
expense at all, for ordinary table tumblers 
might be used to hold the blossoms, 
with the larger cluster placed in a bowl. 
A decoration of this kind is also very 
effective for either a family or company 
dinner, the vases being so arranged as 
not to interfere with the serving of the 
meal. The variety of flowers and color 
of the paper may be changed so that the 
decorative scheme could be used for 
several different functions.

and cover w4th cold water; add half a 
teaspoonful of salt, an onion with three 
cloves stuck in it, a small turnip, one 
carrot cut in thin slices, half a teaspoon- 
ful of sweet herbs, a sprig of parsley, a 
bav leaf, twelve peppercorns, a piece of 
celery, and a tablespoonful of raisins. 
Cover the jar with a lid or tie greased 
paper over it to keep in the steam, set 
in a saucepan of boiling water and cook

for three hours. Mix a tablespoonful of 
flour with a little water, add a table- 
spoonful of ketchup and stir in when the 
meat has been cooking for two hours, 
after that it will occasionally want stir- 
ring up until it is finished. Arrange the 
pieces of meat on a platter and pour 
the gravy over them. Serve with red 
currant jelly and mashed potatoes. If 
carefully prepared this makes a nice 
nourishing and economical dinner for a 
cold day. It can be cooked in the oven, 
but care must be taken not to have the 
oven too hot so that the gravy boils 
away and the nourishment be lost. 

Scotch Shortbread 

To make this national cake take two 
pounds of floiu", fourteen ounces of 
butter, six ounces of sugar, two eggs, 
half an ounce of caraway comfits, or 
"carbies" as they are called in the land of 
cakes, half an ounce of baking powder 
and one tablespoonful of milk if neces- 
sary. 

Rub the butter and floiu* together ; give 
the sugar and eggs a little mixing to- 
gether before adding them to the butter 
and flotu". Add the milk if needed, but 
the whole must be kept in a pretty dry 
state and in that condition worked into 
a firm mass. Knead it well, rubbing it 
down with the hand upon the board, 
again and again, until the whole is a 
smooth compact mass, then break the 
dough into pieces and mould into 
oblongs, squares, or diamonds. The old 
Scottish method was to make square 
cakes of half a pound, each , flattening them 
out with the hand and then with the 
thumb and forefinger pinching around the 
edges 

Cut out a thistle leaf in citron, lay it

N our first visit to the tropics, we 

were stuprised to learn that bananas 



o 



had a much finer flavor, if they were eaten 
when they were just ripe, before they had 
acquired the oily taste which character 
izes much of the fruit found at the north - 
em grocers. In the winter we have 
found it a convenience to buy an "eight 
hand" bunch of bananas (about eleven 
dozen) from a wholesale fruit dealer and 
to pick them at just the right moment 
ourselves. In an inland town this not 
only makes the fruit cheaper than where 
it is bought by the dozen at retail, but 
there is a real profit in the opportunity it 
gives for selecting the bananas and, in 
cold weather, when they are excellent for 
baking and pickling and thus eking out 
the vegetables supply, a family of four 
persons can easilv consume a bunch with-

Jujubes, the Newest Fruit in 
America, the Oldest in Asia 

WHEN the writer was a little 
girl she had a wonderful 
Christinas book telling about 
Santa Claus Land and how he made 
candy and started forth with his rein- 
deer. Many a time she spelled out the 
names of the candies, puzzling especially 
over "jujube paste/* 

Jujube paste, if ever made of the real 
jujubes, has not been so made for a long 
time; possibly our sea-faring ancestors 
brought home the paste from India or 
China long ago, or applied the name to 
a gelatinous confection. 

The jujube is also called Indian fig 
by some, since it grows in India as well 
as in China. It has been grown in China 
for at least four thousand years, while 
this year of 1913 is the first that the 
jujube fruits have become known and 
publicly served in the Uftited States. 

This was at the annual banquet of the 
National Geographic Society. The fruits 
were grown in California, and so import- 
ant and pleasing a novelty were they 
considered that the Toastmaster, Robert 
E. Peary, of the Navy, said: **Before 
beginning with the program of the even- 
ing I am going to read two announce- 
ments to you, the first in regard to a 
special delicacy which you will have the 
opportunity this evening to test. I 
might say that otu- members and guests 
always appreciate and welcome the 
opportunity given us by our friends, the 
Secretary of Agriculture and his assist- 
ants, to test some of the discoveries 
made in foreign lands by the agricultural 
explorers of the Department. Two 
years ago the members of the Society 
were the first, at a large function, to 
test the American-grown dasheen, im- 
ported from China. Last yeiar American 
grown dates, imported from Africa and 
grown in California, were served to us. 
This year we are given the opportunity 
of eating some preserved Chinese ju- 
jubes. The story of their discovery in 



China and their cultivation in America 
is told in the printed matter which is 
placed at every plate this evening." 

These California jujubes were pre- 
served in candied form for this banquet. 
The jujube is mentioned by a Chinese 
writer of eight himdred years ago, 
when forty-three varieties were listed. 
Our pickle man is beaten to a frazzle 
by nature, because just this one thing, 
the jujube, has developed hundreds of 
variations, differing in shape, size and 
flavor. One is as large as an egg, and 
one kind is seedless. Some are nice, 
eaten fresh; some are dried, or candied, 
or preserved in syrup. The seedless 
kind is boiled with rice very much as we 
cook raisins with it. The jujubes grown 
this year at the Plant Introduction Gar- 
den, at Chico, California, were cooked 
in symp and then candied. Many of 
the varieties, cooked thus, resemble in 
color, shape, and flavor a nice quality 
of dates. The branches are heavily 
hung with them, resembling olives, 
or some pltmis with abundant foliage. 

Thus we have a new fruit as welcome 
as choice dates, yet suitable for growing 
many hundreds of miles north of the 
regions adapted to growing the date 
palm trees. The jujube trees in Wash- 
ington, D. C, withstood a temperature 
of 17 degrees below zero the past winter. 

What the banana was in the sixties 
and seventies, an expensive novelty, 
at sixty cents per dozen, the avocado, or 
so-called "pear," is for this decade; 
and very soon let us hope we may have 
the jujube in abundance. j. d. c. 



Company's Coming 

Company's coming, as sure as can be ! 
Company's coming, and maybe to tea!

And, if you deem full assurance you lack.

Margaret's Kitchen 

By H. J. Blacklidge 



INDEED, I am proud of my kitchen. 
Why shouldn't I be? It is where 
I do the largest part of my work 
and I just made up my mind that I was 
going to have all the little conveniences 
possible. Come on and let me show you 
some of the out-o£-the-ordinary ones." 

Margaret opened the refrigerator. It 
was snowy white. "See that little dish 
of powdered charcoal ? I have never had 
a single odor in it since I put that char- 
coal in there." 

"Now look at my kitchen table. No 
oilcloth or paint there for me. I had 
four coats of white shellac put on it 
with just a Uttle bit of sand papering 
between the coats. See how smooth it 
is? And whatever you spill on it wipes 
right off. Hardly anything ever sticks 
to it. You see all my cupboard shelves 
are shellacked also." 

"Oh, what dandy measuring cups!" 
exclaimed one of the friends. 

"Yes, I never guess in my cooking. 
And you have to guess with the ordinary 
cups. You see these are marked with 
fourths, thirds, and ounces. It is so easy 
to be accurate with them. Oh, say, do 
your cakes ever stick?" 

"I had two spoiled last week," replied 
Mrs. Kearney. 

"Well, you just try dredging the tins 
with flour after greasing them. I had 
trouble until I did that. Now mine 
never stick." 

"See this ball of string hanging here? 
When a package comes from the store 
I untie the string and wrap it around this 
ball right then and there. You see it 



hangs here close to the table. I always 
have plenty of string handy. Then I 
put the paper in that hanger. They 
come in handy when I am cleaning a fowl, 
or to wipe off my stove, and for lots of 
other things. Oh, yes, and the waxed 
cardboard cracker boxes are the dandiest 
things for polishing your flatirons. I 
never use paraffine anymore. Just rub 
the iron on a piece of a cracker box." 

"Speaking of irons reminds me of a 
little trick that I have found worth while. 
When I iron collars, I always roll them 
up just as they are worn and fasten them 
in that position with a clothespin. They 
are much nicer when you put them on. 
You know how often they are out of 
shape when left flat after ironing. And 
this way they seem to just slip around 
your neck and drop into their proper 
shape of their own accord. 

"See this little shelf within easy reach 
of my stove? There I keep these flavors 
and seasonings that I use frequently 
while cooking. Of course those that I 
use mostly while mixing are in the cabi- 
net over thft table." 

"I always keep ajar of softsoap handy. 
It is better than soap or washing powder 
for dishwashing. Sometimes I make it 
from washing powder, sometimes from 
the little scraps of soap left from washing 
and the bath. Just put them into water 
and let boil a few minutes or imtil the 
soap is melted. A teaspoonful in the 
dish water cuts the grease fine. There is 
a perforated soap holder, too, for using 
up the little scraps of soap. 

"What in the world have you got 



308 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



that chloroform for?" asked a friend. 

Margaret laughed. **Why the painter 
was a careless fellow and spattered paint 
on my windows and several other places. 
It was too dry for turpentine to remove, 
so I got a little chloroform. You ought 
to have seen the way it let go when the 
chloroform touched it. It was ready to 
come off in about ten seconds." The 
rest looked at her in astonishment. 
They had never heard of that before. 

They were about to return to the liv- 



ing room, when Margaret spoke again. 
**0h, I want you to see my step-saver!" 
She opened the door to the basement. 
At one side was a shelf. "See that shelf? 
That is the best thing in the house, al- 
most. Jack thought of that. Every 
time I find anything that goes to the 
basement I put it on that shelf. Then, 
when I have to run down for something, 
I just take everything on the shelf. That 
is if I can carry them all. Sometimes it 
is nearly overloaded." 



Where Is Your Phone? 

By Flora Huntley 



THE correct placing of a telephone 
in the ordinary home is a matter 
of more consequence than is evi- 
dent at first consideration. Privacy 
is thought to be the chief essential and 
so the telephone is most often located 
in a front hall. Frequently this room 
is not heated nor kept regularly lighted 
in the average home. The mother 
stands while using the instrument and 
the moments she spends in this way, 
while sometimes a pleastire mentally, 
are not at all restful to tired back or 
aching feet. 

Other families place the 'phone half 
way up the stairs, in the effort to part- 
ially accommodate people on both floors. 
This may seem to save steps, but in 
reality is not convenient for any one. 
Unless there are boarders or many guests 
in the family, the question of privacy, 
strictly speaking, need not enter into 
consideration, and in such cases an extra 
instrument can well be afforded. 

Some housewives prefer the kitchen, 
dining room or pass-pantry as the most 
convenient location, but all seem to con- 
sider the telephone as useful chiefly for 
ordering groceries and meat, or making 
business appointments, frogetting the 
fact that in reality they use it as a part 
of social life. Especially in rural com- 



mimities it takes the place of the morn- 
ing call, a letter of condolence or of 
congratulation, quite as often as it serves 
the purposes of business. 

Put the *phone near a sunny window 
in the den or private sitting room, in 
a comer of the dining room, or where 
ever you are accustomed to sit down for 
a few minutes' rest. Have it placed 
at just the right height for use when 
sitting. This costs nothing extra and 
is almost as convenient as a portable 
desk 'phone. Arrange a small table 
or desk just below the instrument so 
that, when you are called to the 'phone, 
you may have pencil and paper handy 
for making notes. An inspiring picture 
or motto above the table, or a vase of 
flowers, will add to your pleasure, and 
a book or magazine if directly imder 
your hand will afford many moments 
for reading while waiting for a *'bus3^- 
line," or between calls. 

Visit your husband's office and ob- 
serve how convenient everything is: 
the light from the window, the desk 
and all its accessories, the telephone 
and revolving chair. Why should not 
the average housewife have her little 
comer for the social and intellectual 
part of her life, and provide for it 
definitely, especially when it can be

had with no expense beyond some 
thoughtful planning? 

If you have been standing up in a 
dark entry to talk to your friends, 
have the 'phone changed at jonce, and 
make these moments, snatched from 



the work of the kitchen, a pleasure and 
a relaxation. Make the cultivation 
of the intellectual and social life as 
convenient as the washing of dishes, 
and the mind and the heart will readily 
respond* 



Five and Ten-Cent Meals 

By Luna May Bemis 

"Can anythinj^ be so elegant as to have few wants and to serve them oneself, so as to have 
something lett to give, instead of being always prompt to grab!" — Emerson 



EVERY small-salaried Jack and Jill 
of us is anxious to reduce living 
expenses to a minimum figure, in order 
to stretch otu* income over some few 
luxuries and claim them as our own. 

I had been frugal all the year so that 
I could invest in an August vacation. 
My trunk was packed and I was trans- 
ported to a tree-shaded city in New 
Jersey, a city with some country 
privileges. 

I resolved to try out the experiment 
of cheap food. Up with the early birds 
I did my marketing along the main 
street. I bore home my first day's 
provisions: One-half dozen mixed rolls 
and buns, five cents; three com muffins, 
five cents; one banana, one peach, and 
one pear, five cents. 

FIRST GROUP OF FIVE-CENT 
MEALS 

Breakfast, one roll, a bun, a corn 
muffin, and a peach. Lunch, one com 
muffin, a roll, a bun, and a pear. Sup- 
per, the remaining roll, bun, corn 
muffin, and the banana. 

My stock of housekeeping appoint- 
ments consisted of a penknife, teaspoon, 
and a bit of salt. Without ice, milk 
except for immediate consumption was 
forbidden; butter was denied, likewise, 
bread and canned goods, from lack of a 
large knife and a can-opener. 

The next day I tried restaurant fare, 
result as follows: Breakfast, rolls, butter 



and a cup of hot milk; lunch, beef stew, 
bread and butter; supper, one ham and 
one tomato-and-lettuce sandwich made 
with graham bread These were all 
ten-cent meals. 

In my purchases I aimed at standard 
values, prices paid by the rank and 
file, not by the upper tendom. Each 
article proved of good, though not of 
superior, value. The third day I re- 
turned to five-cent meals in my room, 
which itemized as follows: One pint of 
milk (5 cents) for breakfast, drank 
very slowly; lunch, two rolls, one bun 
and one-half cake of milk chocolate 
(five cents); supper, two buns, one roll 
and the remaining chocolate (five cents). 

HOME GROUP OF TEN-CENT 
MEALS 

For my ten-cent meals, self-prepared 
(the others, you will remember, were 
restaurant meals), I bought a jar of 
peanut butter, ten cents; three, each, of 
rolls, buns, crullers, and cookies, one 
dozen in all, ten cents; three peaches 
and three bananas, ten cents. The 
meals were all composed of the same 
list, a roll, bun, cookie, cruller, peach 
and a banana. 

Mid singing and sighing, I kept this 
up for one month. It was a pleasure 
to serve myself daintily in my own 
room, but on the other hand, my meals 
were robbed of the highest charm, social 
enjoyment. Each alternate day at the 



310 



Tttfi fiOStON COOtttNG-SCttOOL MAGAZlMfi 



restaiirant was not satisfactory, socially, 
for there was scarcely any one but the 
waiter to smile at and talk to. I had 
not relished the iindertaking at the 
outset, but all the difficulties, except 
the one just mentioned, proved to be 
like John Bimyan's stone lions, fiercer in 
the anticipation than in the realization. 
With this unpretentious food I was 
hale and happy. I make no claims that 
my cheap meals contained food elements 
in the correct proportions necessary 
for the repair of a day's waste. The 
truth is, I think they were not very well 
balanced, as evidenced by the ten-cent 
meals in my room; those contained too 
much starchy substance. 



I thrived so well on this diet that 1 
concluded I would try a similar plan 
when I returned to work. I was less 
hungry in vacation days, and at my 
regular employment I feel sure I can 
prosper famously upon ten-cent meals, 
alternating between those at a res- 
taurant and those self-prepared in my 
own room. Sundays and holidays I 
will confine myself to five-cent meals, 
unless I am invited out. 

"Emerson did not care to live in the 
woods on twenty- seven cents a week, 
but he had no objection to a friend's 
living so, if the friend (Thoreau) foimd 
it profitable." Each must live accord- 
ing to his ideal. 



When the Cooky Jar is Full 

There's a time of great rejoicing and a season of 

delight, 
When the household wheels run smoothly and the 

household sky is bright. 
When domestic troubles scatter as are feathers 

blown afar — 
And it comes when overflowing is the household 

cooky jar. 

Jollity, content and pleasure by the hearthstone 

fold their wings. 
And the children's happy voices join the kettle as 

it sings. 
Like a summer sky, good-nature by no murky 

cloud is dimmed. 
When with seedy circles, crisp and sweet, the 

cooky jar is brimmed. 

Oh, that glowing satisfaction! You might 

widely, vainly, seek 
O'er the country for its equal. Though it comes 

but once a week, 
While its sweet enchantment lingers, hearts are 

light as zephyr wool; 
And 'tis Saturday that brings it — when the 

cooky jar is full.

Query 2081. — "Can you give us any new ideas 
on how to cook plain common vegetables, as 
cabbage, Lima beans and string beans? 

Cooking Cabbage and Beans 

As a rule the simple ways of cooking 
these vegetables are the most satis- 
factory. It seems a waste of time to 
make them into croquettes, soufH6s, 
timbales and the like. Raw cabbage 
is more wholesome than the cooked, 
and it may be prepared with all sorts 
of salad dressings or as the Philadelphia 
Relish given so often in these pages. 
For variety the relish may be stiffened 
with gelatine and turned into molds 
decorated with strips or figures cut 
from pimiento. When to be served 
cooked, do not overcook, leave some 
of the natural crispness in it. Serve 
with cream sauce or Hollandaise sauce 
poured over; or, cut in shreds, dispose 
in layers in a baking dish with cream 
sauce and grated cheese between; finish 
with buttered crumbs and let brown 
in the oven. 

String beans make a delicious cream 
soup; pour through a sieve to secure 
the pulp, flavor with the usual vege- 
tables and serve with croutons. As a 
vegetable, thicken with creamed butter 
mixed with one or two egg yolks and 
a teaspoonful of lemon juice (for a pint 
of beans). For a change add onion 
juice and chopped parsley. Beans of 
all sorts may be used in salads and 
any variety of dried beans may be 



baked like Boston or New York baked 
beans, or with tomato sauce. 



Query 2082.— "Recipe for Mustard Salad 
Dressing; the dressing is light brown or fawn 
colored, not yellow." 

Mustard Salad Dressing 

Put from a teaspoonful to a table- 
spoonful of mixed mustard, such as is 
put up ready for table use, in a bowl; 
add one-fourth a teaspoonful, each, of 
salt and paprika, one-fourth a teaspoon- 
ful of onion juice — if approved — 
and three tablespoonsful of olive oil; 
mix all together thoroughly, then grad- 
ually beat in one tablespoonful and 
a half of vinegar. This will serve two. 



Query 2083. — "Recipe for Grapefruit Mar- 
malade." 

Grapefruit Marmalade 

Take six grapefruit and four lemons; 
cut each fruit in quarters and slice 
the quarters through pulp and rind 
as thin as possible, discarding all seeds. 
Weigh the prepared fruit, and to each 
pound allow three pints of cold water. 
Pour the water over the prepared fruit 
and set aside for twenty-four hours. 
Let boil gently untU the rind is very 
tender (it will take five or six hours), 
then set aside until the next day. Weigh 
the material and to each pound add one 
pound of sugar. Let cook until the 
syrup thickens slightly on a cold dish. 



311 



312 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



Stir occasionally while cooking. Use 
all the water designated. When fin- 
ished the pieces of rind should be held 
in generous proportion of light-colored 
and not very firm jelly. 



Query 2084.— "How may a tea kettle be kept 
free from lime or sediment? How may while 
enamel ware be kept clean? Should salad be 
served before or after a meat course?" 

Care of Tea Kettle 

Wash out the tea kettle once a day 
and, twice a week, scour with the cleans- 
ing agent best adapted to the material 
of which the tea kettle is made. 

Cleaning White Enamel Ware 

The cleaning agents advertised in 
this magazine will not harm enamel 
ware; try them, then use the one best 
adapted to your purpose. 

Place of Salad at Dinner 

A crisp green vegetable salad is 
served with the roast of meat or poultry. 
Cucumbers are served with fish; a 
crisp green vegetable, as celery, endive, 
lettuce etc., is served with game; some- 
times pieces of fruit, as orange, are added 
to the green vegetable served with 
game. French dressing is the only 
dressing appropriate for service at dinner. 



Query 2085.— "Recipe for Peppers Stuffed 
with Sweetbreads, Almonds, etc., given sometime 
ago in this magazine." 

Peppers Stuffed with Sweetbreads, 

Etc. 

Select eight green peppers that will 
stand level; remove a piece around the 
stem with the seeds. Pour boiling water 
over the peppers, cover and let stand 
half an hour. Cut a parboiled sweet- 
bread and a peeled tomato in small 
pieces, add six blanched almonds cut 
in slices, one cup of hot boiled rice, 
one teaspoonful of grated onion and 
salt to season; mix together and use 



to fill the peppers. Set the peppers 
into a baking dish; add a cup and a 
half of boiling water and let cook half 
an hour. Serve on individual plates, 
with HoUandaise sauce poured over 
the pepper. 



Query 2086. — **What is Viscogen and how is 
it used?" 

Viscogen 

Viscogen is a solution of lime in sugar; 
it is used to thicken thin cream; as 
viscogen contains nothing but lime, 
sugar and water, it is harmless. One- 
fourth a teaspoonful is used to three- 
fourths, a cup of cream. To make vis- 
cogen, dissolve five ounces of sugar in 
ten ounces of water. Slake two oimces 
of quick lime in six ounces of cold water; 
strain to remove unslaked particles of 
lime; combine the two liquids and shake 
occasionally for two hours. After three 
or four hours set the mixture aside to 
settle, then pour off the clear liquid. 
Store in small bottles. Use a glass 
stopper. Exposed to the air viscogen 
darkens quickly and loses its strength. 



Query 2087. — **We live in the country and 
raise fine chickens; would like to know how to 
handle them to have them tender when properly 
codted." 

• 

Keeping Poultry for Tenderness 

Fowl should not be fed for some hours 
before taken for food. Pick at once 
without the use of water; tie a string 
tight around the neck to exclude air, 
and without drawing hang in the re- 
frigerator or where there is a good 
circulation of cold air. On no account 
lay on ice. Thus htmg, fowl will keep 
in a sweet condition six or seven days 
in summer, and a longer time in winter. 
This is for fowl to be broiled or roasted. 
Fowl to be boiled or braised should not 
be kept quite as long. The fowl should 
be dressed as soon as they are removed 
from the cool air, and cooked as soon 
as possible thereafter.

When the jar is filled add a level table- 
spoonftil of salt. Potu* in cold water; 
put dill on top of pickles, and seal air- 
tight as for canned fruit. Place the 
jars in the stm each day until the water

small piece of fresh red pepper may be 
added too. These pickles will keep for 
a year, in a cool, dry place. If a two- 
quart jar is used, two level tablespoon-

Work and Programs for Women's clubs. 

By Caroune French Benton. 

Cloth, 12mo. Price, $1.25 net; 

Boston. Dana Estes & Co. 
The time has long since passed when 
a special field is needed for the extension 
of women's clubs. Actual demonstra- 
tion has proven their worth to the indi- 
vidual and to society. Multitudes of 
women on farms, on remote ranches, in 
little villages, in great cities, have felt 
their impetus to a broader and more 
useful life. They have instructed those 
of little education. They have given a 
wider horizon to those hemmed in by 
circumstances. They have trained the 
timid to speak, and, of late years, they 
have prepared the way for women of 
leisure, and influenced them to take up 
what is wanting, — larger housekeeping, 
— the bettering of social and civic con- 
ditions. 

In this valuable little book, the author 
not only gives in a clear and concise 
manner the best means of organizing, 
and establishing permanently women's 
clubs of all sorts, but she gives full years' 
programs suitaUe for use by dubs of all 
sizes and in all localities. 

This is a very comprehensive and 
useful guide to all those who wish to 
know how to conduct clubs. 

The New Cooking. By Lenna Frances 

Cooper. Cloth. Price, $1.50, Bat^ 

tie Creek; The Good Health Pub. 

Co. 

"What you eat to-day is walking 

around and talking tomorrow," so 

says Dr. Kellogg, superintendent of the 

Battle Creek Sanitarium — recognized 

as one of the world's leading authorities 

on dietetics and hygiene Food to 

the body is as fuel to the engine. Good 

wholesome food hygienically prepared 

gives life, vigor, energy and efficiency. 

Therefore modem cookery has become, 

not merely an art, but a science. And 

the housewife is now recognized as the 



guardian of the health of the home, the 
controller of conditions whereby the 
physical welfare of its members may be 
promoted. 

This book contains Miss Cooper's 
favorite recipes, inlcuding practically all 
the dainty and delectable health dishes 
in use at the Battle Creek Sanitarium. 
It is a reliable guide in the kitchen — a 
scientific teacher — a book to be 
referred to. 

K the question in dietetics be that 
of "high protein" or "low pro- 
tein," it teaches quite fully and exten- 
sively the preparations of the latter 
dishes and, at the same time, how to 
serve a palatable and attractive meal. 
We find naught but good things in this 
volume. 

Around-the-World Cook Book. By Mary 
Louise Barroll. Price, $1.50 net, 
postage 13 cents, New York; The 
Century Co. 
It is the aim of this book to introduce 
into American households some of the 
toothsome dishes of other lands; and to 
suggest to the American housewife that 
she make use of the best cooking of New 
England, the South and the West, for 
the distinctive dishes of these regions 
should be known and enjoyed through- 
out the land. 

All the recipes have been tested and 
are therefore reliable. They have been

A dapper Uttle drummer was com- 
pelled by circimistances to pass the 
night in a village hotel in that part of 
Illinois popularly called "Egypt." At 
breakfast he ordered soft-boiled eggs. 
The waitress deposited two in the shell 
before him. Looking up, the drummer 
said, "Please break the eggs in a glass." 
With a withering look of scorn the 
buxom waitress replied, "Well, good 
Lord! if you can't break two soft-boiled 
eggs in a glass you'd better go to a 
hospital.

Aids in Selection 

Professors of anthropology, sociology, 
and economics from the Golden Gate 
to Eastport have given descriptions of 
the ideal bride and husband with words 
of advice and solemn warning to those 
contemplating the bond of matrimony, 
and now M. EHe Dautrinin the Paris 
Figaro tells young girls how they can know 
the character of a man. Wateh him at 
table. "If he should bend over his 
knife and fork and finish his roast in 
three gulps beware! He is not the 
man that will be able to submit to 
tender sympathy and caresses." If he 
eats without enjoyment, he will never 
appreciate his squaw's hats or style 
of dress. Immoderately fond of sweets, 
he will nag. Does he prefer the cheese 
and roast? He will be muscular and 
placid. A bread-eater is fond of the 
country. 

The best test of a future husband is 
to watch him at the moment of dessert. 
See how he handles a peach. Does he 
take it distractedly or like a man in a 
hurry? Does he swallow it hastily?

Then say to yourself: 'He is not the 
husband for me.' But if he takes it 
slowly and tenderly, like a connoisseur 
who appreciates what he eats, if he does 
not swallow it at once, but peels it with 
the air of an artist, and treats it with 
devotion, then do not hesitate to marry 
him as quickly as you can." Is this 
fantastical? No more so than advice in 
the matter of eugenics that has come 
from Cambridge, Worcester, Chicago 
and Berkeley.

As one of the great South African

This new book of recipes 
by Mrs. Rorer sent h'ee. 



MclLHENNVS 

TABASCO 

SAUCE 



MRS. SARAH TYSON RORER has just pre- 
pared a new book of recipes, hitherto unpub- 
lished, in which will be found directions for making 
many unique and delectable dishes, and other infor- 
mation of value to those interested in good cooking. 

7*his new book of Mrs. Rorer's will be sent 
free to anybody anywhere upon request. Just send 
your name and address on a postcard to Depart- 
ment H-6, Mcllhenny Company, Drexel Building, 
Philadelphia, Pa. 

Of course the prime purpose of this new 
recipe book is to attract more favorable attention 
to our Tabasco Sauce, and to promote its use more 
widely instead of dry pepper as a seasoning for all 
dishes requiring pepper. 

It is now generally admitted among cookery 
experts that pure, unadulterated liquid Tabasco 
pepper is far superior to cayenne or black pepper 
because of intense seasoning power, delicious 
flavor and wholesomeness. 

McIIhenny's Tabasco Sauce is the original and 
only genuine liquid Tabasco pepper, and is being 
used to great advantage by famous chefs and good 
housekeepers throughout the civilized world. 

!t is more wholesome and a better seasoning 
than cayenne or black pepper, and makes a most 
delightful table sauce. 

Order a bottle from your grocer today ; and 
don't forget to send for Mrs. Rorer's new recipe 
book.

Since its original publication, Miss Farmer's ''Boston Cooking 
School Cook Book" has, in new editions, incorporated large addi- 
tions, but the wealth of new material — the result ot experiments 
in the author's class rooms and embodied in recipes which have 
been thoroughly tested — has grown to such an extent that it has 
become necessary to incorporate it in a separate volume which 
forms an almost indispensable companion to the author's invalu- 
able "Boston Cooking School Cook Book/' 

The " New Book of Cookery" contains more than eight hun- 
dred recipes upon all branches, including manv new and import- 
ant dishes not to be found in any other work. It is profusely 
illustrated.

No. 5 



A Small New Elngland Country Home 

By Charles Vaughn Boyd 
Associated architects, James G. Kelley and Harold S. Graves, Boston, Mass. 

WHILE the illustration and dis- panoramic view of fertile valley and 

cussion of our larger country distant hill, 

homes may be profitable in Attractive as the site undoubtedly 

disseminating valuable architectural sug- is, its unusual character might have 

gestions, the portrayal of small houses been just the stumbling block for an 

is far more important, particxilarly if unskilled architect. However, without 

the designs selected for reproduction destroying any of Nature's handiwork 

be the work of architects who have in a vain effort to reconstruct the site 

given due consideration to the small to suit a given type of house, the archi- 



house problem. Fortunately, the meri- 
torious small house is now not difficult 
to find. Indeed, anyone who has faith- 
fully compared the average small house 
of to-day with its predecessor of, let 
us say, twenty years ago, must have 
discerned the marked improvement in 
American domestic architecture. This 
gratifying evidence of progress is, of 
course, but the outward index to a more 
highly cultivated taste on the house 
builders' part and to a greater desire 
for simpUcity on the part of the archi- 
tects. A striking instance of this up- 
ward trend of architecture is found in 
the little home, which Mr. Philip R. 
Spaulding has recently erected near 
Weston, Massachusetts. 

The situation is ideal, for the house 
nestles in the midst of a miniature 
forest, half way up a great rugged hill; 
and from this vantage point the owners 
of the house have an ever delightful 



tects associated in the work gradually 
evolved a small house, which in design 
is so admirably adapted to its situation 
that it appears almost indigenous — a

house, furthermore, whose interior ar- 
rangement also eloquently points to 
the architects' conscientious study. 

As one instinctively expects in New 
England, the Spaulding house is of 
frame construction; but the conven- 
tional painted-clapboard or stained- 
shingle exterior has here given away 
to wide cypress siding, stained a deep, 
warm brown, the exterior trim being 
painted a soft olive green. The choice 
of brown and green — two colors that 
are so closely identified with Nature's 
palette — has, of course, still further 
linked the house with its beautiful 
setting. 

Although the contour of the site 
necessitated one end of the basement 
being practically above grade, the low, 
broad lines of the house have been 
maintained through an interesting dis- 
posal of green- painted trellises over 
the lower exterior wall surfaces. The 



apparent height of the house has also 
been decreased by the long, sweeping 
line of the main roof, which is carried 
out over the porch, thus making the 
latter an integral factor in the general 
design. 

Had conventionality been permitted 
to govern the planning of the house, 
a hall would no doubt have monopolized 
a portion of the front elevation, thus 
curtailing the outlook from the living 
room. Instead, however, the entrance 
hall has been placed on that side of the 
house most remote from the highway — 
a wide driveway winding up the hill- 
side to the living porch, from which 
the main door opens directly into the 
hall. The porch, although it is partially 
sheltered by one side of the staircase 
wing, extends beyond the house line 
sufficiently to derive the benefit of 
both the wide outlooks and any wan- 
dering summer breeze. 



A SMALL NEW ENGLAND COUNTRY HOME

The entrance hall is comparatively 
restricted in area, but its exceptionally 
convenient arrangement is an adequate 
compensation. The only staircase to 
the second floor rises from the entrance 
hall by easy stages. In a nook, created 
by a turn in the staircase, there is 
a telephone stand, which is well lighted 
by the large triple window on the 
stair landing — and should not those 
words well-lighted be underlined, when 
one recalls the dark inaccessible cor- 
ners usually reserved for telephones, 
even in large houses? Opposite the 
main entrance, a door leads to a small 
vestibule, which serves in a triple capa- 
city — as a rear entry, as a landing 
for the basement stairs and as a passage 
to the kitchen. A large coat-closet 
is another good feature connected with 
the hall, as it makes the presence of 
a hall-stand, which is almost inevitably 
unsightly, unnecessary 

The coloring of the hall is exception- 



ally pleasing, especially as it blends 
effectively with the color scheme of 
the living room adjoining. A gray 
and ecru foliage paper is used for a 
wall covering; soft ecru hangings at 
the windows, wood -brown rugs, and 
dull,waxed, chestnut woodwork complet- 
ing a treatment both decorative and 
restful. 

The living room is at the right of 
the entrance. Theoretically, at least, 
a living room is an apartment to live 
in. Many so-called living rooins, how- 
ever, fall far short of what should be 
their chief qualification, sometimes on 
account of ill-assorted furniture, not 
infrqeuently through over-omamenta- 
tion, more often, perhaps, because of 
an inharmonious or disquieting color 
scheme. The living room of the Spauld- 
ing house is, on the contrary, perfectly 
adapted to its requirements. It is 
quiet in color, consistantly good in 
architectural detail, generous in pro-

DINING AND LIVING BOOM 



portions and particularly well situated, 
as from its windows the occupants 
may enjoy uninterrupted views over 
the surrounding countryside- 
Valuable space is often lost in small 
houses by the subdivision of the avail- 
able floor area into a really superfluous 
number of rooms. In the Spaulding 
house, there is no separate dining-room; 
one end of the living room, instead, 
being provided with an antique mahog- 
any iHning table. The table chosen 
for this service is of such a character 
that, at other than meal hours, it 
forms an entirely satisfactory reading 
table. One disadvantage of utilizing 
a living room for the serving of meals 
lies in the inavoidable presence of a 
sideboard which, unlike a table, can- 
not be put to dual use. Here, however, 
into one wall has been built a side- 
board, which neither absorbs useful 
floor area nor robs the room of its liv- 
ing room aspect. Thus, instead of 
two small separate rooms, neither of 
which would be adequate in size for 



real comfort, we find one room, which, 
through its well-proportioned dimen- 
sions, creates a sense of spaciousness 
little to be expected from a glance 
at the exterior of the house. 

The beamed-ceiling eflTect of the liv- 
ing room was obtained by an unusual 
yet economical method. Instead of 
being concealed, the joists of the sec- 
ond floor were left exposed, the inter- 
vening spaces being covered with beaver 
board, painted ivory white. The joists 
are stained brown, a rich brown, which 
corresponds with the finish of the 
stained -and- waxed chestnut trim in 
the living room. 

Brown is indeed the keynote of the 
living room color scheme. The walls 
are hung with a self-figured, golden 
brown paper; and the same beautiful 
shade of brown predominates in the 
coloring of the rugs and chair-coverings. 
The window hangings are of deep ecru. 

In the furnishing of the room, wicker, 
fumed oak and mahogany have been 
permitted to intermingle. The result 



A SMALL NEW ENGLAND COUNTRY HOME

is good, however, as, while the brown 
color scheme has been maintained, 
the pieces of old mahogany, introduced 
into the room, have prevented any 
monotony of effect. 

A small serving pantry connects the 
dining end of the living room with 
the kitchen. The latter is an especially 
well-arranged room. Its somewhat un- 
usual shape, which was the outcome 
of a desire for cross-ventilation, has 
created near the pantry an alcove, 
which provides an advantageous posi- 
tion for the sink, with an abundance 
of light. Above the sink, small sliding 
doors permit the freshly-washed dishes 
to be placed in the pantry-shelves; 
and in this way many steps are saved 
for the maid. The range is so situated 
that a single chimney does duty for 
the entire house; and, near the range, 
there is a commodious cook's closet. 
In order that it may be readily replen- 
ished, the ice-chest is placed in an alcove 
conveniently near the rear entry; and 
in the basement, a well-equipped laun- 
dry is situated. 

The second floor, which is very 
compact in plan, contains several fea- 
tures, interesting, because the owner's 
intention originally was to utilize the 



third floor exclusively for storage space. 
As an example, beside the chimney 
there is a small closet, in which is 
located a ladder-like stairway lead- 
ing to a large trunk room. To faciH- 
tate the raising and lowering of the 
trunks, there is in the ceiling of the 
hall a hatch equipped with block- 
and-tackle. After the building of the 
house had commenced, it was decided 
to have a maid's room in the third 
floor; consequently a regulation stair- 
case was provided. The original idea 
of ladder-stairs and block-and-tackle 
was not abandoned, however; and pro- 
spective house builders may in the 
latter, at least, find a hint worthy of 
note. 

In the owner's bedroom, which is 
the largest, on the second floor, there 
is also a good suggestion for utilizing 
otherwise wasted space; as, under each 
dormer window, several drawers have 
been built in — an arrangement which 
might be advantageously employed in 
many houses. There is a smaller room, 
now used as a den, immediately behind 
the owner's room; the bathroom being 
directly across the hall. A pleasant 
guest room and several closets occupy 
the balance of the second floor. The 
chestnut trim of the lower floor has

Beyond the Soup 

By Ladd Plumley 



IF Polhemus had been the heroine 
of the modem heart-thtob, he 
wotild have thrown himself on the 
omnipresent sofa and burst into wild 
sobs. In fiction of an earlier time he 
wotild have sworn a mighty oath and 
ordered his minions to saddle his pal- 
fry that he might away to the wars. 
Polhemus did neither of these things. 
He said a strong word, grabbed his 
pipe, and took the elevator to a studio 
on the top floor. 

"What's up?" asked the painter 
turning from his easel. 

"Nothing, according to your Crusoe 
ideas." 

"I can guess. The inevitable has 
gripped your innards. The fair one 
has flipped the mitten." 

"That's what you call humor," re- 
marked Polhemus, crunching tinpleas- 
antly on the stem of his pipe, and 
throwing himself into a chair. 

"Beg pardon, old fellow. I really 
want to liven you up. You look like 
the last of the Sadducees. Let's have 
it!" 

"She's right; April is always right. 
Everybody says it. You yourself have 
said it a thousand times. Saying it 
don't make it 'any easier to understand. 
That's the dingle-dangle trouble ! • The 
fact that I can't imderstand proves 
that you're right." 

"What does she say — this April 

girl?" 

"She says that I'm impracticable — 
that it's a roistake — that — well — 
that we must part." 

"So you are — the most impracticable 
human that ever used manicure scissors 
for sardine cans. It's likely hereditary. 
Maybe your grand-ancestor was an 
alchemist." 

"Ever since we've been engaged it 



•has shadowed everything. She's tak- 
ing a course of cooking, niu-sing, and 
the rest; that has made it worse." 

"Miss April will never have to cook. 
And it's fortunate that your impractic- 
ability need not worry you. Clipping 
coupons isn't difficult." 

"Well, it's off, I just received the 
note of final dismissal. It's hopeless; 
a fellow can't change the length of 
his nose." 

"It isn't hopeless. There's that slosh- 
er of rainbows whose daddy dropped 
him slathers of dough. He moved 
up to Fifty-Ninth Street and swapped 
delicatessen eats for lobster and sizzle — 
took a studio like a comer of the Grand 
Central terminal. Say, all he swabbed 
were Waldorf salad frescoes. The boo- 
dle slipped into a Honduras mine, 
and when he painted the sweet thing 
you've seen in every shop window he'd 
sloped back to forty cent table d'hote. 
It takes the punch inside to push the 
goods out." 

"I've got the pimch, but how can 
an impracticable fellow prove that 
he isn't?" 

"That tomato squasher learned to 
paint." 

"He had a line; I haven't anything." 

"You might hitch your necktie so 
it wouldn't be a purple cruller sprinkled 
with mustard — Lord, what taste ! And 
that cruller gives an idea. This April 
girl — I dote on the name — she's 
deep in domestic doings. Why shouldn't 
you take her cue? You couldn't ever 
make a bed decently — you've got 
yovu" limitations; but you would learn 
to cook." 

"Why don't you suggest loading 
fireworks? That would only kill me; 
my cooking would kill the other fellow." 

"You'U have to dig in and get in-

struction." 

'•What would be the good?'* 

"If you learned to cook a dinner 
from soup to coffee, nobody, not even 
the April girl — What eyes she's got! 
but even she couldn't call you im- 
practicable." 

"But she and you and all the rest 
say Tm impracticable; therefore there's 
no use trying to learn to cook, because, 
if I learned. I wouldn't be impracticable, 
and that's just what I am." 

"That's the trouble with you. If 
you could chuck the thinking you might 
get somewhere." 

"There's no place where they teach 
cooking." 

"Where do chefs come from? They 
aren't bom holding a skillet and with 
white caps." 

"Even if I could get lessons, how 
would I have a chance to show off?" 

"The first thing is to learn." 

"Where is this hash kindergarten?" 

"How should I know? I'm a painter 
— I only eat." 

"What do you think of advertising?" 

"Shades of Napoleon! That's the 
first practical bunch I've ever heard 
you sling. The thought of cooking 
has improved you. Yes, advertise. 
There must be a place where the cub 
cook is whanged into the red-nosed chef." 

The ptmch was April, and any one 
who has ever looked into the sapphire 
eyes of that young lady will concede 
the punch had power. And with the 
punch, and notwithstanding the im- 
practicability. Polhemus accomplished 
miracles. 

All that winter and far into the spring 
the student labored. From the an- 
chovy state he took so much delight 
in what is the most wonderful of arts 
that, at times he actually forgot the 
punch. 

Those who have made the journey 
through a magnificent soup, a peculiar 
fish, a weird entr6e, a watery roast, 
in a low-ceilinged house in Second Avenue, 
may remember that all terrors of the 



trip were mitigated by remembrances 
of the soup. And it was in the base- 
ment of this establishment that Pol- 
hemus apprenticed himself to a master- 
craftsman, who boasted that in his 
own novitiate he handed skillets to 
the chef of the cazr of all the Russians. 

From the beginning Polhemus recog- 
nized that his master was a supreme 
artist in only one thing — in soups. 
Give him some scrawny ox-tail, three 
leaves of withered cabbage, and one 
ancient carrot, and a box of spices, 
and he could bedevil a semi-fluid that 
would make an epicure lift his eye-brows 
and smack his lips. 

"When I have mastered his soups," 
Polhemus said to himself, "I must 
find another instructor." 

During the first month it cost the 
student, aside from a heavy retainer 
for the chef, a good many dollars 
for materials btimed on a brazier as 
sacrifices to .Miss April's eyes. But 
before the end of six months the French- 
man entrusted his pupil on three occa- 
sions with making the soup. It was 
as if a htmdred dollar a minute surgeon 
should ttu^ over an operation to an 
imderstudy. 

It was a pity that Miss April could 
not have made a visit to the kitchen 
in Second Avenue. There the sup- 
posedly impracticable Polhemus, mus- 
tache waxed, to copy in all things the 
technique of the craft, white-capped 
and white-aproned, discussed with the 
old chef whether a salad dressing needed 
three more drops of vinegar, and if 
it were possible to so season a dubious 
pigeon as to make it available. 

"But it is a serious thing. What 
shall I say! like the engineering of the 
canal Panama. Is it that I shall let 
fall three more drops? And the pigeon? 
Let us make the trial. As to the soup? 
I shall decide." 

The little room steamed as if from 
a leaky safety-valve of a boiler. Over 
all hung odors as thick as the French- 
man's soup. And, hustlc-d by the mas- 



BEYOND THE SOUP 



355 



ter and his excited assistant, leaped 
two wrestlers of sauce-parts. In and 
out rushed waiters, meek deference 
to the chef and to Polhemus, disdainful 
of the pot wrestlers, and helping them- 
selves to the ordinary dishes; but always 
waiting their turn while the chef meas- 
ured out the soup with as much accuracy 
as if it were liquid gold and its cube- 
lets of potato and carrot were diamonds 
and topazes. 

Such was the training that Polhemus 
received, and before the end of his 
apprenticeship he was an artist in soup 
and a not ill-qualified master in other 
parts of the menu. 

Said the old Frenchman, late one 
evening after the last Welsh rarebit 
had sizzled upstairs on its almost red- 
hot oval, '*M'sieu,' it is that the em- 
ployment office Madam gave me the 
information that at a house in the 
country there is wanted the chef. It 
is not the permanency, but for the 
occasion temporary. Fine pay and the 
experience! If M'sieu' decides yes, he 
shall do well." 

**I don't know about anything of 
that sort," replied Polhemus. "You 
remember that I told you it was for 
personal reasons that I wished to learn 
scientific cookery. Definitely, I might 
say I have never, even lately, thought 
of making it a life work." 

"It is that I have the appreciation 
of that; you may have thought you 
would degrade my art to — to what 
you call him? the hobby?" 

"No, no," said the pupil, "Never! 
and, strange enough, lately I've thought 
that perhaps my original purpose was 
getting shelved. It is a high ambi- 
tion to get to the top." 

"It is my opinion that if M'sieu' shall 
take the time he has the ambition 
not beyond what his talents could 
surmoimt." 

"Thank you," said Polhemus. "And 
I have learned already that it might 
take years to get very far." 

"Years, many, many years! For 



soup, as M'sieu' is not ignorant, I 
can be taught nothing — nothing. 
But for entries — My, my! that is an 
affair of the lifetime!" 

"Where would one go to obtain 
high-brow instruction — say in entries?" 

"Your high-brow, what is that?" 

"The most perfect instruction?" 

"Paris, most assuredly." 

"And where in Paris?" 

"It is that M'sieu' shall go to Paris?" 

"Don't ask me. I never know what 
I'm going to do fifteen minutes before 
I do it. But if I should go?" 

"You shall take my card. Seel I 
write on the card a note of approbation 
of M'sieu'. It shall wide open the door 
to the affections of a — What you say? 
a high-brow magnificent." 

Polhemus put the card into his pocket- 
book. "And you advise me to take 
this temporary work?" 

"Most assuredly. It is the exper- 
ience that you need. You shall fear 
nothings! Only do not fail with the 
soup." 

Polhemus believed that he would not 
fail even with the soup. He had eaten 
many dinners in country houses and he 
thought he could astonish palates ac- 
customed to ordinary cooking. It would 
be a fascinating experiment; and the next 
day Polhemus mounted the stairs to the 
office of the Madam. 

"For excellent reasons I do not care 
to have my identity known," said 
Polhemus. 

"I could tell you of more than one 
French aristocrat who has done the 
same," replied the Madam. "There is 
no dishonor in acting as a chef — and 
the pay is high." 

"I shall shave oflf my mustache and 
wear one of a different color, and I shall 
wear a wig and take an assumed name," 
said Polhemus. 

"Certainly — it is imderstood." 

"Then it's settled," said Polhemus. 

Two minutes afterward the applicant 
had difficulty in controlling his aston- 
ishment. The position offered was none

other than to cook at a dinner to be given 
by Miss April's mother. 

April's mother needed a cook. The 
last had gone just before the day set for 
a dinner. Thus came the opportunity 
for Polhemus to prove that no one could 
henceforth call him impracticable and 
the chance to cook himself into the ap- 
proval of the sapphire eyes. 

It was a providential opportunity and 
as such Polhemus regarded it. His 
heart quickened as he thought of it, but 
if he had expressed what was really in 
his mind, he^ would have acknowledged 
that the quickened heart-beat had more 
to do with a desire to prove to himself, 
and incidentally to others, that he was 
equal to preparing an entire dinner. 

On the morning of the day set for the 
dinner he almost wished himself back 
in the Second Avenue kitchen. 

*'The maid will show yotir room, "said 
April's mother. **The dinner will be at 
seven-thirty. There will be nine guests 
and three of the family — twelve in all, — 
and goodness knows I hope everything 
will go on all right !" 

**It is that you will leave him to me," 
said Polhemus in a husky voice and im- 
itating the verbiage of his master. * 

'*The maid will show you the menu. 
If you want to change it in unimport- 
ant particulars, you can do so. Mrs. 
Simmons — you will find her a reliable 
woman — will come over to help. 
There's a phone in the hall. If you don't 
find what you need, order it. The con- 
fectioner will bring the cakes and ices at 
seven." 

"Assuredly, it is well arranged," said 
the chef. 

It proved one of the most exciting days 
that Polhemus enjoyed in his craft. 
Only once, from a window of the kitchen, 
did he catch a glimpse of Miss April. 
She was in tennis rig and strolling toward 
the courts with a fine-looking young man. 
Once the sight would have seared the 
heart of the chef with jealousy, but just 
then he happened to be pondering over 



a detail of the dinner. 

At seven-thirty the chef had every- 
thing in hand. He felt a glow of 
artistic pride as he sniffed the fragrant 
soup. 

"What a heavenly odor! "exclaimed a 
voice that once could shake his heart as 
a hurricane shakes palm trees. From 
his kettles Polhemus glanced upward. 
In the door stood a vision that ought 
to have made him oblivious to any soup. 

"I couldn't help sneaking away. I've 
just finished a course in cookery. It is 
wonderful! The richness fills the whole 
rear of the house." 

"Assuredly, it is the perfume of a soup 
most fine." 

"What a cold you've got!" exclaimed 
Miss April. "Your voice is awfully 
husky. But that soup — Yimi, yum ' 
Ta, ta! see you later!" and Miss 
April vanished. 

With the "Ta, ta!" Polhemus jerked 
himself erect. Who could suppose she 
would take such liberties with a cook! 
But he had no difficulty in turning 
his thoughts to the final seasoning of 
his dishes. 

One of the maids was most attractive. 
She it was who had shown Polhemus 
to his room, and when the dinner had 
begun she complimented the young 
chef. 

"Monsieur, there's a fat man in 
there who asked Madam where she 
had found her cook. He said he had 
never eaten such soup even in Paris — 
that a cook who could make such soup 
was worth ten thousand dollars a year." 

"That is true," replied Polhemus. 
"That soup is absolutely perfect." 

The maid bustled away, lingering 
at the door to smile at Polhemus. 
But the chef was engrossed in his art. 

Notwithstanding doubts that he had 
concerning his entries, rumors came 
in with the empty dishes that all the 
dinner was a wonderful success. This 
was later in the evening confirmed 
when April's mother came in person 
to express her approbation. 



BEYOND THE SOUP 



357 



"I've never known a dinner like 
that in a private house," said the delight- 
ed hostess. "The soup! It was amaz- 
ing, superlative!" 

"The soup was perfect," replied 
Polhemus, forgetting his role of French- 
man. "But sonetime I hope to prepare 
an entire .dinner that will be as perfect 
as my introductions. A dinner should 
have a climax — toward the end. My 
dinners have the climax at the wrong 
place. I'm going to Paris to devote 
myself to my art." 

"It was all delicious!" exclaimed 
April's mother. "And my daughter 
has been taking a course in domestic 
science. She is coming to tell you how 
lovely yotir cooking is." 

Five minutes later April again ap- 
peared. She motioned to Polhemus, 
and the chef followed her to a little 
room that had no other occupants. 

"Now, sir, what do you mean by this?" 
asked Miss April severely. "Of course, 
I knew you at once." 

"I hoped to prove to you that my 
impracticability could be overcome." 

"You've certainly proved that you 
could cook," remarked Miss April. 

"The young fellow I saw you with 
this afternoon?" asked Polhemus. "He 
was very attentive." 

Miss April turned her face to the 
wall and became absorbed in tracing a 
pattern of the paper with her finger. 

"Of course," continued Polhemus, 
"you've got the right to receive such 



attentions. My object in coming here 
was to show my skill — and — well. 
I've concluded that it was nothing else". 

"Nothing else," repeated Miss April, 
still tracing the design of the paper. 

"Nothing but that," said Polhemus. 
"I've had an extraordinary tutor in 
soup. My fish and all the rest do not 
come up to the soup. Oh, I know 
it! you needn't say it! but that is only 
because I have not had expert teaching — 
not the most expert, except in soup. 
I'm going where I will learn to excel 
in everything. In ten days I shall 
be in Paris. I can hardly wait. You 
have taken lessons and can understand." 

A sound came from the neighbor- 
hood of the tracing finger, half sniff 
and half sigh. 

"You'll never change," she said 
wearily, turning to face the chef. "You 
are the most impracticable person that 
ever lived. The young man that 
you noticed? I told him I would 
give him an answer to-morrow, — it 
will be, 'yes.' " 

"It beats me!" Polhemus exclaimed 
to the artist the next evening. "She 
ate that soup and yet she called me 
impracticable!" 

"Holy mackerel, of course she did!" 
snorted the painter. "Go to Paris 
and keep your nose over pots and 
kettles! If you should marry, a super- 
lative chef would be ruined. But you 
never will; you are too impracticable." 



The Christmas Birds 



At Christmas time the presents fly, 
Like birds against a leaden sky; 
And some are swallows swift and bold 
And some are orioles of gold. 
And some are wrens and some are jays, 
Or doves in mottled blues and grays, 
While some I'm sadly forced to say 
Seem very like to birds of prey. 



At Christmas time the presents Ay 
Like birds, twixt low estate and high. 
Kindred and friends and neighbors speed 
Them on their way, and blest, indeed, 
Their mission, when unselfish each 
Some phase of Christlike love shall teach. 
But gifts that seek return, say I, 
Are very like to birds of prey.

Mothering Our Girls 



By Eleanor Robbins Wilson 



RUSKIN, in one of his inimitable 
preachments anent character 
building, says, — **You may 
chisel a boy into shape, as you would 
a rock, or hammer him into it. if he 
be of a better kind, as you would a 
piece of bronze. But you cannot ham- 
mer a girl into anything. She grows 
as a flower does, — she will wither 
without Sim; she will decay in her 
sheath as the narcissus does, if you 
do not give her air enough; she may 
fall, and defile her head in the dust, 
if you leave her without help at some 
moments of her life, but you cannot 
fetter her, she must take her own 
fair form and way, if she take any, 
and in mind as in body, must have 
always — 

** 'Her household motions light and 
free 
And steps of virgin liberty.*'* 

Whether the good stuff in the aver- 
age American boy doesn't warrant 
something better than the hammer- 
ing treatment, I shall not presume to 
say, but without exception all the 
superioc girls of my acqtiaintance have 
unfailingly been reared by the fetter- 
less method. They have — to a girl — 
been mothered by women who have 
understood a mother's most gracious 
prerogative, — the telling art of focus- 
ing the maternal light for the child's 
development, that in "her own fair 
form and way" might flower the rich- 
ness of an unthwarted individuality. 

There is no more pathetic spectacle 
confronting us to-day than the pitiable 
contingent forced to live half-lives and 
quarter-lives through the arbitrary rul- 
ings of misguided parenthood. The 
burnt offerings of promising person- 
alities that have been sacrificed on 
the altar of ignorant leadership! 

I have in n^nd a woman of the 



sparrow-like type of spinsterhood now 
dragging out a forlorn and drab exis- 
tence in a small New England town, 
who is nothing if not a living testi- 
monial to a tyrannical mother — a 
person whose whole attitude toward 
life seemed that of 'a conquering spirit. 
Strange as it may appear, this woman 
was of gentle blood and ranked far 
above the average citizen in schooling. 
But the desire to dominate her sur- 
roundings was paramount. She prided 
herself on her strong will and her 
ability to "conquer" her children. 

Thwarted and check-mated in almost 
all of the moves of youthful desire, 
the more independent of the two daugh- 
ters threw up the game and left home, 
the more conscientious remained and 
submitted. A few years ago death 
finally robbed the mother's dictatorial 
hand of its sceptre, leaving this lonely 
and dependent daughter to master 
the awkward problem of adjustment 
to freedom of action, some hoarded 
money that she simply cannot get 
accustomed to handling and a host of 
bitter reflections on "what might have 
been." Assuredly not an enviable 
legacy ! 

Ruskin was right. "You cannot ham- 
mer a giri into anything." 

Motherhood is, indeed, a complex 
problem, but we have yet to discover 
that which may yield richer returns 
for the time involved. When the rank 
and file of womanhood have grasped 
the indisputable fact that our homes 
amount to about so much as the mothers 
in them, and that our nation may 
never be greater nor stronger than 
the boys and girls we are molding in 
these self-same several homes, then, 
and then only, will the colossal mag- 
nitude of our work be realized. Mock- 
motherhood, with all its unattractive 



358 



MOTHERING OUR GIRLS 



359 



attributes, will slough off, and the 
golden service of painstaking child- 
rearing assume its destined dignity. 
God speed the day! 

Recently, at a grammar school grad- 
uation, I watched a group of white- 
frocked, beautiful girls, while all un- 
bidden these words drifted across my 
mind. — "She grows as a flower does. — 
she will wither without the sun," and 
never more forcefully was brought 
home the fructifying strength of a 
mother's love. Not the pale, sickly 
imitation, composed of untoward indul- 
gences and excessive fondling, but that 
golden wealth of affection that, while 
imparting strength, coaxes into growth 
all latent possibilities. For fused into 
this real light of mother-love are all 
the prismatic-like splendors of tact, 
intelligence, patience, courage, cheer, 
sympathy and comraderie. 

An eminently successful woman of 
the present day was recently recount- 
ing her very apparent indebtedness 
to her mother. ** Mother's greatest gifts 
to me," she loyally confessed, **were*a 
most tactful stuveillance of me and 
all my affairs, an adroit assistance 
in helping me to help myself, and 
sort of a great encompassing expec- 
tation that spurred me to do my best." 
That this clever and useful woman 
continues to lavish her great creative 
ability is now a matter of pride to the 
citizenry of her native country. Here, 
indeed, is a flower among women, the 
product of a mother who believed in 
the education of heart, head, and 
hands. 

^ It is a matter to rejoice over that 
the old-fashioned flagrant mistake of 
bending the career of the young to 
please parental whim is beginning to 
disappear. The happier results of voca- 
tional training, due to a little dis- 
criminating insight, are causing the 
scales to fall from our eyes. Scarcely 
a week passes that the writer does 
not witness its far-reaching effects. 
For example, Mary, whom her mother 



desired to become a musician from 
the mere flimsy excuse that she her- 
self had been denied musical train- 
ing, has become a successful dietitian 
and a correspondingly useful member 
of society. While the dulcet-throated 
daughter of the village hackman is 
being led grand-operaward. And so 
on might be quoted innvimerable in- 
stances. Thus the ideal co-operation 
between parent and child is being 
established. We are beginning to look 
for the innate spark of genius in the 
unfolding personalities of the young 
idea and, by judicious supervision, help 
them to perfect such gifts. 

All modem educators, winning the 
most permanent and satisfactory re- 
sults, are they who are demanding 
proof of exact thinking through exactly 
executed work of the hands; hence, 
the yearly increase in our technical 
and manual training courses and classes 
of domestic arts. Yet, on all sides, 
are we met with the critical railing of 
women who would eliminate the domes- 
tic science classes from the public 
school, arguing that this is a phase 
of education which belongs to the 
home. But the challenging fact re- 
mains that the average mother is 
positively neglectful in this respect. 
One of our direst needs still remains 
to acquaint our grammar and high 
school girls with the rudiments of 
home-making. It forms one of our 
most drastic measures to abolish ignor- 
ant, slipshod and deathdealing methods 
from the carelessly kept home. 

More than one * little mother" of 
the domestic science classes of our 
public schools has been the means 
of enlightening a big mother to the 
ultimate good of an entire family. 
May the time soon come when these 
classes are not only compulsory in 
the public schools of our towns and 
cities, but even may the girls of rural 
localities enjoy the advantages of a 
traveling Cooking School patterned 
somewhat after the fanjous traveling

Koch Schnle of Cassel in Germany, 

Far and near let "mother" be re- 
minded of her matchless province till 
she realizes that the most valuable 
asset to society was, is, and ever shall 
be, the homemaking, mother-trained 
girl. For indelible corroboration of this 
statement, ask your district nurses, 
your social service workers, your night 
court judges, or take a casual peep 
into the mortality statistics of a census 
report. In 1911, out of a total of 
839,284 deaths in an observed area, 
149,332 children died under one year 
of age, and 209,482 died under five 
years of age, making an appalling 
aggregate of 358,814 deaths of little 
folks under five years of age, out of 
the sum total of 839,284 deaths for 
the entire year. We cannot but won- 
der what percentage of little lives 
were martyrs to ignorance, or how many 
untrained and careless women yearly 
lift blighting hands for the gift of 
motherhood. 

But, on the whole, it is reassuring 
to the true motherheart to observe 
the unparalleled study that the present 
strenuous times devotes to the develop- 
ment of the child. Never before have 
normal, defective, and deUnquent chil- 
dren so thoroughly arrested the atten- 
tion of some of our sanest thinkers. 



Never before have we combined so 
effectively to eliminate destructive ten- 
dencies oif the young as with the present 
day potent appeal to the constructive 
faculties. 

The Montessori "Houses of Child- 
hood," spreading from the poorer dis- 
tricts of Rome throughout Italy to 
France, Germany, England, and our 
own progressive country, are inculcating 
a new directive method in our homes'. 
We are, at last, joining hands with the 
child of to-day, to help build to-morrow's 
salvation. Mother is slowly but surely 
learning the new role of reverent observer 
and guide, without obtruding her per- 
sonality, and unlearning the fallacy of 
coercion, — in short, adopting the fet- 
terless method that Ruskin advocated. 

More and more are we proving the 
tonic effect of ideal suggestion and, 
while our girls are flowering into promis- 
ing womanhood, let us not fail "to 
encompass them with great expec- 
tations," that the future may proudly 
record, — 

''Look to the blowing rose about us — 
*Lo. 
Laughing,' she says, 'into the world 

I blow, 
At once the silken tassel of my purse 
Tear, and its treasure on the garden 
throw.' " 



The Piper 



The wild pipes of the Northern Wind 

Are calling, loud and free. 
And I must follow, follow and find 

Wherever he leadeth me. 
Caroling loud, caroling clear, 

"Come with me, romp with me, 

Taste of my cheer!" 



Oh, sweet is the perfume he brings me, 

The fragrant breath of the pine, — 
And sweet is the song he sings me, 

With a sweetness dslK divine. 
Chanting high, crooning low, 

"Follow me, follow, 

Joy shall you know." 



And ever I follow the charmer bold. 

Across the meadows brown, 
As the children followed the piper of old. 

Away from the noisy town. 
Following here, following there, 

Glad in the track 

Of the wind, I fare. 

Christine Kerr Davis. 



Millicent's Christmas Offerings 



By Mix Thorn 



MILLICENT was unpacking her 
trunk, a lengthy proceeding, 
shaking out her crumpled finery 
patting abused looking hats into shape, 
and spreading skirts and blouses upon 
a convenient couch. Sometimes she 
smiled in reminiscent fashion at a 
note or stray snap-shot, that slipped 
out of an overful portfolio, and then 
she sighed as she spied somtf gay auto- 
mobile pennants. 

"I feel now, mother,** she exclaimed 
an hour later, "that my beautiful 
visits are really over, for Joel has 
just carried my trunk, that much 
traveled trunk, to the attic, but oh, 
Tve a sort of lost empty feeling, glad 
as I am to be at home again, with 
my own best-of-all, family. Why," 
with a remorseful glance around the 
cheerful sitting room, "it's so dear, 
and I love it, I love it, yet every thing, 
yes, let me say it, seems, to-day, 'flat, 
stale and tmprofitable.' '* 

A quick rush of tears filled the gray 
eyes, and Mrs. North patted the slim, 
young hand that was suddenly held 
out to her. Her very touch was re- 
assuring to Millicent in her perplexity. 

"I understand, my child, I know 
exactly how you feel,** she said, "your 
little jotimey into the world, won- 
derful though it was, is a bit unsettling. 
You will be your own happy merry 
self in a few days; why,** smUing whim- 
sically, "haven't I been a girl myself! 
Go out in the garden, follow the but- 
terflies, or give Laddie a good walk; 
the poor dog has missed you; find 
the sunshine, anyway," and she hur- 
ried away. 

A few moments later, Mrs. North 
heard a whistle, and saw the girl and 
an ecstatic dog turning down the 
lane, so she knew that part of her 
advice, at least, was being followed. 



Millicent North had just returned 
from a series of visits to three of her 
school girl friends in their city homes, 
and it was small wonder that her 
country home should seem quiet and 
prosaic after her "Feast of soul," as 
she expressed it. 

At Helen Manning*s she had motored 
daily, visiting one fascinating sub- 
urb after another, lunching at smart 
inns, had tea at some quaint tea-house, 
in the late afternoon, dinner at pic- 
turesque shore resorts, and had been 
taken into a charmed circle com- 
posed of lively yoimg people, who 
willingly received Helen's friend. 

At Joan Travers* she had attended 
charming lunches, had seen the latest 
plays, flushing with pleasure to be 
in a mvsterious box, so near the more 
mysterious stage, and thrilled with 
delight at the musicales, where silvery 
voices seemed to sing to her alone. 

At Mary Channing*s she did the 
shops, lingered long in picture gal- 
leries, attended lectures at the beau- 
tiful college set on the heights above 
the busy city, and when, after six 
weeks of such visiting, she returned 
home in early June, though the vil- 
lage was brave in bud and flower, 
her own garden a riot of opening roses, 
the comfortable old house with its 
doors and windows flung open to wel- 
come her, a peaceful haven, yet she 
found to her consternation, that she 
sadly missed all that she had left, 
and she longed to do something hard, 
and thus fill both hands and mind. 

It was Mrs. North who enquired 
one day as together they sat on the 
vine-covered piazza — "It*s early to 
ask, perhaps, but summer is here, 
and it is the chosen time to be thinking 
up Christmas gifts. Now, childie, what 
are you going to give these dear gen- 



361

erous friends who have done so much 
for your pleasure?" 

MiUicent, who had been silent for 
sometime, sober eyes fixed upon the 
stretch of green meadow land across 
the trim cut hedge, shook her head 
hopelessly. At last she began, as if 
ashamed of her abstraction: **0h, I 
don't know, mother; embroider some- 
thing, maybe doilies, maybe make work- 
bags. Suppose Helen might be pleased 
with a cushion for her den — that 
dear little den," and then she lapsed 
into quiet again. 

"Hasn't Helen enough cushions left 
over from her couch at school? I 
seem to remember quantities of them 
in the sitting room you and she shared 
at Miss Billings'. Then embroidery 
takes time and patience. Beside, these 
girls' mothers were your hostesses, 
and should be included in your Christ- 
mas scheme, it occurs to me." 

"I know that is so," and Millicent 
sat up straighter, her pre-occupation 
gone. 

"Well, dearie," and Mrs. North laid 
down her mending, "I've been thinking 
up a plan which I believe is a feasable 
one, and I hope my daughter will 
agree with me. It will be good 
for her in her present mood; it will 
pleasantly include her mother, and 
would be the solution of her Christ- 
mas problems. Listen! I propose that 
you and I together shall make jam, con- 
serve and pickle, filling a quantity of 
jars with cotmtry fruits fresh from our 
own farm, and send these to your town 
friends for Christmas, daintily wrapped 
and labeled. Now, does this appeal 
to you, MiUicent?*' 

"It's a lovely plan, a charming 
notion," cried the girl, taking a few 
dancing steps, her eyes sparkling, and 
her dimple beginning to show in her 
cheek. "How did you think up such 
a heavenly idea? Here I am, a year 
out of school, ignorant enough about 
such matters; I'd joy to take lessons 
from you, oh wise mother. When, when 



can we begin our course in cooking?" 

"We can start with cturant jelly," 
was the reply, "and continue when 
the berries are ripe. Raspberry jam 
is always available and delicious; then 
come plums, peaches, and grapes. Why, 
it will be delightful for me to teach 
you, sweetheart, though I've always 
loved such things, even when I must 
do them alone." 

In the long July days, Millicent, 
enveloped in a voluminous apron, and 
with rolled-up sleeves displaying her 
dimpled elbows, might have been dis- 
covered haomting the cool old kitchen, 
and stirring and tasting in most 
approved fashion, as she and her 
mother watched the currant juice boil- 
ing on the range, and, later, fairly gloat- 
ing over the store of translucent sweet- 
ness, safely stored away in jelly glasses. 

"I didn't dream what fim it could 
be to do up fruit," broke in the young 
girl, as she enthusiastically pasted some 
dainty holly labels on the tall slim 
glasses, with the magic words, "Currant 
Jelly." inscribed on each one. "I feel 
sort of an Alice in Wonderland, with 
all my new happenings." 

Greatly to the amusement of her 
family, Millicent insisted in helping 
gather the cultivated raspberries from 
their own vines, and emerged, sun- 
browned and weary, with brimming 
pails of the fragrant berries. 

In the next town Millicent and 
her mother discovered some odd little 
jars that were just what they wanted 
to hold the raspberry jam, and late 
in August, while brown bees boomed 
above the garden beds, and the brakes 
along the high road were turning yel- 
low, mother and daughter worked their 
magic and filled each waiting jar with 
the luscious jam. "I wish," said Mil- 
licent, locking up from her congenial 
employment, "I do wish, mother, that 
we could capttire some of the summer 
breezes, the light and sweetness, and 
bird songs, and seal them up in one 
jar, a big jar, th^t could be opened 



MILLICENT'S CHRISTMAS OFFERINGS 



363 



some particularly dark, gloomy day, 
when snow flakes were in the air, and 
a real old giant wind was abroad." 

"That would be a welcome jar, 
a gift of gifts," was Mrs. North's 
reply, **but to preserve the fruits 
of stmimer, with all the sunshine stored 
up in them, is the very best we can 
do, at present." 

Later, some of the perfect Damson 
pliuns from their own orchard were 
converted into a marvelous conserve, 
nuts and oranges being added; and 
more plums were turned into firm jam. 
Then followed the honeylike, golden, 
peach marmalade, and pickled peaches, 
dark and spicy, were put away in 
rich syrup. Spiced grapes ended the 
list, and well they might, for the fruit 
closet shelves fairly groaned under 
their load of good things. 

"Oh, Mater mine," said MilUcent 
one blue October day, standing in 
the fruit closet, stu^eying with par- 
donable pride the imposing array of 
jars and pots and glasses, with their 
attractive labels, "Isn't it just gor- 
geous and satisfying! To think that 
my most important Christmas gifts 
are all arranged for, and such unique 
gifts, too. Then how much I've learned ; 
why, I feel like the wisest of young 
persons, with all the useful knowledge 
I have acquired." 

"It makes me very happy to realize 
it," and Mrs. North looked fondly 
at the transfigured yoimg face, "I 
own I am very proud of my house- 
wifely daughter." 

A certain November afternoon, as 
warm and balmy as if it belonged 
to September rather than to Novem- 
ber, the expressman carried out, one 



by one, from the North home, three 
strong-looking wooden boxes, destined 
for New York, and on each was nailed 
a placard, so plain that all the world 
might read, "Keep in a cool place. 
Not to be opened until Christmas." 

Nor were they opened until Christ- 
mas,- I am glad to say. At holiday 
time such heartfelt, overflowing letters 
did Millicent receive, that she fairly 
glowed with happiness. Both her friends 
and their mothers wrote thanks. 

"None of our Christmas gifts pleased 
us, as did yours, ..dear child," said 
Mrs. Traverse' thank-you note, "it 
was such a happy thought, and how 
all this country treasure truly enriches 
a city home!" 

All the Channing family sent a joint 
note of thanks, each one a line, begin- 
ning with the father and ending with 
the ten-year-old sister. 

"Oh, that splendiferous box," began 
Helen Manning's letter, "a veritable 
well of delight. Wonder how you man- 
aged to get so much in one plain, or- 
dinary box! Father is for sending 
me down to your mother to learn 
real accomplishments, as he says. Guess 
I'll come if you ask me. I yearn to 
emulate you." 

Beaming Millicent read the notes 
aloud, and then read them again to 
herself. "Well, it was beautiful," she 
sighed, "the gathering, and the doing 
up, the sending away, every, every 
bit of it. Why, mother, it's an all-the- 
year-round pleasure. Let us, two learned 
ones, begin any time to plan what 
shall fill our fruit closet next year; yes, 
and plan at the same time the rich- 
ness that must overflow into the homes 
of our favored friends." 



Dreams are the ghosts of hours agone. 
Vanishing like to a whispered sigh, 
Harmonies, faint, of a half -sung song 
Lost like the rose in the sunset sky. 



Dreams 



They are the misty sails that fly 
In the twilight down to the moon-kissed sea — 
Gone like the night wind sobbing by — 
Ahy who can bring back my dreams to me?

In Its Own Country 

By Kate Hudson 



IT was December twenty-second; 
tomorrow Miss Ranney's school 
was to disband for the holidays, 
and tonight Miss Ranney's young ladies 
were sitting aroimd the study fire- 
place — a merry, chattering group — 
planning the several home trips and 
comparing enthusiastic notes on pro- 
spective holiday joys. 

"Why, of course we'll have one!" 
Sallie was saying; **we always do; we 
just have to for our little twinnies." 

"So do we; at my Aunt Lucy's," 
Mildred chimed in; "a great big tall 
one, trimmed with big colored glass 
balls and bells and icicles, just blaz- 
ing with electric lights." 

"Well, we don't!" said Flora, a 
bit down from the heights of her very 
nearly sixteen years. "We haven't had 
one since I was seven years old; they 
are so sheddy and take up so much 
room, and it's only the little bits of 
children that care for them anyway. 
Christmas Trees are dolefully stupid 
things for grown folks, aren't they, 
Fraulein?" turhing to the German 
teacher, who just then was joining 
the happy circle. 

"Stupid? Only for the very smallest! 
The Christmas Tree! ! " exclaimed Frau- 
lein Nicolovius; "But no! No one 
ever gets too old to love its sturdy 
evergreen, its pine smell, its soft radiance. 
And how it brings back one's happy 
days! Ach, when I think back!" 

"Tell us about yoiu* happy days, 
Fraulein," cried the girls; "tell us 
about your German Christmas Tree, 
Fraulein Meta." 

"My father, you must know, was 
an Oberforster — what you call a head- 
forester — and we lived deep in the 
woods near Pritzwalk, in an old grey 
house with four gables. And in the 
hall — the Flur, we call it — there 



hung many wide antlers of twelve, 
fourteen and even sixteen prongs ! With 
Advent-tide, with the last Sunday in 
November, the dear mother began 
to prepare for Christmas. There were 
mufflers, mittens, and head-over-ear 
caps to knit, so father and the three 
brothers would not feel the cold too 
much in our Northern woods; and 
there were frocks to make for the 
several dolls belonging to Dorette (our 
nest-chick); and the big much-handed- 
down doll-house had to be repapered, 
and fiuTiished with fresh window-cur- 
tains; and there were pine-cones, larch 
tassels and gall balls to gild and silver, 
and nutshells (neatly glued together) 
to bronze for tree decorations. Sister 
Selma and I, great girls of fifteen and 
sixteen, would help bravely till bedtime 
and then, in the tiny room we shared, 
and by the dim light of a small bedroom- 
lamp, we'd sit up for another hour or 
two working on the worsted slippers 
(with a stag's head surroimded by grass- 
green oakleaves, spread over toe and 
instep) for father, and the " Alt-Deutsch" 
coffee-table cloth and napkins, with 
which we were going to stu'prise mother. 

"Along about the twelfth of Decem- 
ber mother would begin her baking, 
and for the next week or ten days the 
house would be steeped in the scent 
of ginger, honey, cardamon, and cara- 
way, and the huge box in the carefully 
guarded pantry comer would slowly 
fill to overflowing with cinnamon-stars, 
and almond-wreaths, with golden honey- 
cakes and spicy, dark-brown Lebkuchen 
boys and girls, soldiers, sailors and 
every known (and unknown) species of 
animal and bird. 

"On Christmas Eve the three yoimger 
ones would be sent to bed, and then 
mother and we two girls would trim 
the tree, not a very big one, but one

straight-grown and sttirdy — for father, 
himself, always selected it and cut 
it down — standing firmly planted in 
the very middle of our "good room." 
To its fragrant twigs we tied the glit- 
tering gold cones and nuts, red apples, 
bimchlets of raisins and the most artis- 
tic specimens of our cake; and wherever 
we could make one stick we would 
fasten a white candlekin. The sim- 
ple presents were laid on the long, 
white-covered table under the tree. 
Of course, we were pretty tired when, 
at last, we went to bed, all soaked in 
Christmas sights, sounds and smells; 
and as we'd snuggle down into oiu* soft, 
warm beds we would hear the faraway 
bells of Pritzwalk Church ringing in 
the Christmas Day, and calling the 
people to the midnight service, which 
mother often and father always at- 
tended. 

"On Christmas morning we were 
always up and ready for the summons 
by six o'clock; while father in the "gute 
Stube" was lighting up the tree, mother 
wotild marshal us in line according 
to age — first Dorette, then the boys, 
then I, then Selma and so on to our 
dear Grosspapa, the oldest of us all — 
and at the tinkle of the Christmas 
bell we would march in and gather 
round the tree. Mother wotild sit 
down at our little old piano and we 
would stand singing "0 du frohliche, 
O du selige, freude bringende Weih- 



nachtszeiiV until the candles had burned 
quite low; then we'd fall upon our gifts, 
and by stmrise — the late northern 
winter-sunrise — Christmas would be 
well under way 

"Breakfast .over, we would have 
brisk nms through the snowy woods; 
then came the jolly dinner with its 
big chestnut-stuffed goose; and after- 
wards the tree was once more lighted, 
while all of us, even father's "Forst- 
Eleven" (the yotmg men taking a 
practical course in forestry under him, 
of whom father always had two on hand) 
and we five children — sang Christmas 
and folks-songs till bedtime, and then 
Christmas was over." 

"And was that all?" queried Flora; 
"no company? No other children? 
Just only the family celebrating to- 
gether?" 

"Yes," sighed Fraulein, "Just the 
family together; but all together." 

"I wish you were going with us 
tomorrow, Fraulein Meta," said Sallie, 
rubbing her rosy cheek against Frau- 
lein's shoulder, "to see an American 
tree, our tree." 

"Oh,dear," groaned Mildred, "seems's 
if I just couldn't wait till tomorrow 
for home and the holidays!" 

"Ach ja," laughed Fraulein, with an 
odd little break in her voice, "when 
one is only thr6e hours by train away 
from one's mother! Christmas and 
home are complementary." 



A Cheer Song 

If the path's an easy one. 
So that footsteps lightly run, 

Where's our gain? 
Few learn power on the plain ! 

If the way to up the hill, — 
Forward! Climb with right good will, 

Growing strong 
As we bravely tramp along! 

Mountain tops are always won 
Through the wind and rain and sun! 

Don't get blue! 
Life is all worth singing to! 

Aldis Dunbar.

THE WINTER SINGER. 

cheery comrade of somber days, 
Enlivenme winter with summer lays, 

Jovial chickadee! 
The dull sky dizzy with swirling snow, 
Keen pierces the cold, but your brave notes flow 

Warmly, happily, 

Chickadee! 

Forgetting the aches of a world grown gray, 

1 shut my eyes and dream of the May, 

Hearing you, chickadee! 
There's a birdsong for every month of the year 
But when others are silent you voice good cheer, 

Genuine poetry. 

Chickadee ! 

The song sparrow sings the whole year through. 
But even he yields, in winter, to you, 

Neighborly chickadee^ 
Oh, worth the spring's full chorus of praise, 
Your lyric that lives in the dead, white days! 

Welcome your winter glee, 

Chickadee!

OUR LITTLE CHEF 

OUR readers may notice that we 
are trying to restore the figure of 
the little Chef that used to appear quite 
conspicuously on the pages of this 
magazine Oldtime readers may recall 
the original cover pages of the maga- 
zine in green and red, which always 
carried the profile of the cheerful chef. 
Somehow, we can not reason why, 
in changing covers, we dropped out 
the use of the chef, though it had come 
to be regarded as a kind of trade mark. 
Now we propose to give the illustration 
place again, occasionally at least, and 
to make use of it, as formerly, somewhat 
as the trade mark or symbol of our 
profession. 



Never was so much attention given 
to the conditions of health as at pre- 
sent. Preventive methods are pursued 
by both physician and surgeon. Pre- 
liminary to attendance at public schools, 
children's eyes are tested, teeth are 
inspected and throats are examined 
for signs of disorder and ill health. 
And these things are taken into con- 
sideration in connection with the pros- 
pects of the futtu"e progress and wel- 
fare of the child. Epidemics, we have 
learned, are sure to follow violations 
of nature's laws. Contagious diseases 
must be wiped out. We can ill afford 
to tolerate a single menace to the 
healthfulness of individual or com- 
munity life. In all pure food laws 
and sanitary regulations protection from 
threatening ills is sought for. The 
chief evils we have to contend with 
are imcleanliness and malnutrition. 

THE HOMECRAFT COURSE 

IN the homecraft course^ recently 
instituted in the Wadleigh High 
School, New York City, is an inter- 
esting attempt to meet practical de- 
mands in girls* education. The home- 
craft course is for girls whose interest 
is in up-to-date home-making rather 



EDITORIALS 



367 



than in advanced literary or scientific 
study. The work is taken chiefly by 
students who do not intend to go to 
college, but who wish to make the 
best use of their time while in high 
school; and it is particularly recom- 
mended for those who expect to stay 
in school only two years or less. 

The course is both "practical" and 
"cultural." It answers the everyday 
needs of girls who mean to be real 
home-keepers and it affords abimdant 
opportunity for studies that are for 
enjoyment as well as for work. Domes- 
tic science and domestic art, with house- 
hold arithmetic, study of vocations, 
"clothing — its care and remodeling," 
are prominent subjects the first year. 
Drawing, music, biology, English, and 
physical training are required subjects, 
with current history, English history, 
and modem languages among the elec- 
tives. Latin and advanced mathemapes 
are conspicuous by their absence. 

In the second year hygiene and sani- 
tation are added to the requirements, 
and other studies may be chosen from 
a list which includes millinery, house- 
hold chemistry, European and American 
history, history of women's work, arts 
and crafts, and modem languages. 

Household management, a required 
study, is a feature of the third year 
of the course. Applied design and 
applied physics are among the subjects 
that may be selected by the students. 
In the fourth year the girls delve a 
little deeper into the philosophy of 
homecraft by means of a required course 
on social efficiency. They may also 
regale themselves with a number of 
more advanced studies, such as: Fun- 
damentals of legal procedure; physiology, 
bacteriology, and sanitation; household 
design and decoration. 

Throughout the course the emphasis 
is on applied, rather than theoretical 
knowledge; and the work is so arranged 
that, regardless of whether a girl com- 
pletes the four-year course or leaves 
before $he finishes, she has acquired 



a fund of workable ideas of direct value 
to her in the immediate problems of 
her life. 

THE HEALTH HABIT 

IP a man is sick it is because he has 
violated the laws of Nature. And 
such a one, instead of feeling disgraced, 
often feels sorry for himself and explains 
his sad plight to any one and every 
one who will listen. 

Man is made to be well and happy 
and useful. And if a person is happy, 
the probabilities are he will be well; 
and in order to keep well he has to 
be useful. 

Health is the most natural thing 
in the world. 

Nature is on our side. Health is 
the norm, and all Nature tends thither- 
ward. 

Physicians nowadays do not talk 
about curing people. All the wise 
and good physician cati^ do is to put 
the patient in line with Nature. Nature 
heals, and all the healing forces of Nature 
are perfectly natural. 

We know the rules of health. Every 
one of common intelligence is familiar 
with them. The trouble is that many 
men consider themselves exceptions; 
and postponed punishment, does not 
deter them from violating the . laws 
of Nature. 

We must not only know the rules 
of health and bear them in mind, but 
we must bring to bear will to see that 
we live them. 

We have the knowledge, but we lack 
the technique — tlj^t is to say, we haven't 
got the habit. 

Health is a habit, and a vast niunber 
of people in America are getting it. 
They make it their business to be well 
every day and all the time, an4 the rules 
whereby they succeed are endorsed 
by every physician. First, think health, 
not disease. 

Keep your mind on the ideal, and 
picture the strong, happy, self-reliant 
person that you would like to be.

Breathe deeply in the open air, 
holding the breath, then expelling it 
slowly thru' the nostrils. As a people, 
we eat about one-third more than 
we really need, and so our energies 
are consumed in getting rid of the 
waste. 

The greatest disturber of health is 
fear. Fear means impaired circulation; 
impaired circulation means impaired 
digestion; imperfect digestion affects 
the entire program of Ufe. To elimin- 
ate fear we must breathe more and eat 
less; work more and loaf less; praise 
more and scold less; love more and 
hate less.

Good Food — Not Gluttony 

IT is amusing, though somewhat dis- 
heartening, to find how widely the 
idea still persists that delicacy in cook- 
ery ,means gluttony. Those people who 



really appreciate perfection in cookery 
are usually delicate eaters, who manage 
to get both reasonable enjoyment and 
excellent nourishment out of a com- 
paratively little food. It is often the 
man who professes a profound contempt 
for the art of the kitchen who proves a 
gluttonous feeder. He generally eats 
voraciously, not wisely. Yet the con- 
trary opinion is frequently held. For 
instance, only the other day, I saw in 
one of the London dailies a note by a 
journalist who had asked one of our 
leading caterers whether the English 
as a race eat too much, the answer being 
"No, but they prefer a chop, steak, or 
other substantial fare to the various 
mysteries so dear to foreigners, who 
doubtless think that a seven-course 
dinner provides them with a lot for their 
money." Of course this is quite incor- 
rect. The foreigner is educated in the 
art of eating, and knows that by making 
large use of stewing and sauces the 
palate is pleased, and the body better 
nourished, with a smaller consumption 
of food, because the viands are made 
more digestible, and therefore satisfying. 
And therein lies the secret of good 
cooking. — Food and Cookery, 



Health is the most precious possession 
of man. Health is the only capital of 
the workingman. Without health, the 
workingman is of no use to his employer. 
Without health, life to the employe is 
not worth living. Therefore, the preser- 
vation of health is the most important 
consideration of the worker. 



If you would make repair equal to 
waste, cut out grouch, hate, worry, 
jealousy and fear, and focus on work 
play, love, and usefulness. — Doctor

IN all recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after 
sifting once. Where flour is measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a 
level cupful is meant. A tablespoonful or teaspoonful of any designated material is a 
LEVEL spoonful.

bones without disturbing the shape of 
the fish. Spread the bread with a 
little sauce tartare, set the fish above 
and coat it neatly with more of the 
sauce. Garnish the edge with a row 
of capers, and push a branch of water- 
cress under the bread at each end. 
Sauce tartare is mayonnaise dressing, 
to one cup of which two tablespoon- 
fuls, each, of very fine-chopped onion, 
capers, parsley and pickles have been 
added.

cook about twenty minutes to the pound; 
baste often with the dripping and 
dredge with flour after each basting. 
Serve with onions, boiled until begin- 
ning to be tender, then set around 
the pork in the pan to finish cooking. 
Baste the onions when the meat is 
basted. 

Ham Baked with Cider 

Let a choice ham stand covered with 
cold water over night; drain and set 
over the fire in a fresh supply of cold 
water; let heat slowly to the boiling 
point, then simmer four hours. Re- 
move the ham to a deep baking pan, 
take off the skin, pour over one pint 



SEASONABLE RECIPES., 



of the liquid in which it was cooked 
and one quart of hot cider; baste 
each ten minutes and let cook until 
the bones in the shin may be turned. 
Serve hot with a dish of spinach, 
chopped and mixed with a small quan- 
tity of cream sauce, about half a cup 
to a generous pint of spinach. For 
sauce, skim off the fat from the liquid 
in the baking pan. Take one cup 
of this liquid, one cup of rich brown 
stock and thicken with one-fourth a 
cup of flour cooked in one-fourth 
a cup of butter; season with salt and 
pepper and stir in one-fourth a cup 
of currant jelly. 

The first part of the cooking may 
be done overnight in a fireless cooker. 
Apple sauce, apple-and-celery salad or 
cabbage salad are all appropriate with 
ham. 

Creamed Carrots 
Cut carrots, after scraping, into slices 
or Julienne strips; let boil in boiling 
water until tender; drain, and for one 
pint of carrot melt three tablespoon- 
fuls of butter; in it cook three table- 
spoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful 
of salt and one-fourth a teaspoonful, 
each, of paprika and sugar; add one 
cup and a half of milk and stir until 
boiling, then add the carrots. 



Christmas Salad 

Take sections of grapefruit pulp, 
one-half the measure of tender inner 
stalks of celery, cut in bits, one-half 
the measure of small cubes of apple, 
mixed with a tablespoonful of lemon 
juice to keep them from discoloring, 
and about three tablespoonfuls of can- 
died cherries, cooked tender and cut 
in slices. Season with oil, lemon juice 
and salt. For a pint of material use 
two tablespoonfuls of oU, one of lemon 
juice and a scant half-teaspoonful 
of salt. Garnish with a small por- 
tion of mayonnaise dressing 

Lettuce, Date- and- Pecan Nut

in the oven to dry the dates, then 
cut each in four or five lengthwise 
strips, discarding the seeds. Cut the 
half-meats in half a pound of shelled 
pecan nuts in three pieces, each. 
season separately, or together, with 
half a teaspoonful, each, of salt and 
paprika, three tablespoonfuls of vine- 
gar or lemon juice and six tablespoon- 
fuls of oil. Serve in a border of heart 
leaves of lettuce. Serve at luncheon 
or supper with Graham or ryemeal 
bread and butter. Mayonnaise or cream 
dressing may replace the French dress- 
ing. For the cream dressing, beat 
one cup of double cream, three table- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice, and one- 
fourth a teaspoonful, each, of salt 
and paprika until firm throughout. 
Season the dates and nuts slightly 
with salt and pepper before adding 
the dressing. 



Little Pumpkin Pies 

Cut a pared pumpkin in inch-cubes, 
and steam until done; let dry over a hot 
fire in a colander, then press through 
a sieve or ricer. To a cup and a half 
of sifted pumpkin, add half a cup 
of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of molasses, 
two eggs, beaten without separating 
the whites and yolks (one egg and 
one- third a cup of cracker crumbs 
may be used) , one tablespoonf ul of 
ginger, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter 
and one cup of rich milk, and turn into 
small tins lined with pastry. Bake 
about twenty-fiveminutes. Serve, turned 
from the tins, reheated a little and 
decorated with whipped cream. Sweeten 
the cream slightly and flavor with 
a few drops of almond or vanilla extract. 

Frozen Pudding, Bombe Style 
Boil one pint of water and one 
cup of sugar ten minutes, after boiling 
begins; add half a teaspoonful of gela- 
tine softened in two tablespoonfuls 
of cold water, and when cold one cup 
of canned raspberry juice (unsweetened). 
and freeze. Make a boiled custard 
of three cups of rich milk, six yolks 
of eggs and one cup of sugar; when 
cold begin to freeze; when half frozen 
add one cup of cream, beaten light but 
not dry, and one cup of fruit, cherries

in small pieces, raisins, currants, pieces 
o£ candied pineapple, etc., that have 
been soaked several hours in rich 
syrup or rum. The raisins and cur- 
rants will be better if cooked tender 
first of ail- Finish freezing the mix- 
ture. Line a melon-mold with the 
raspberry sherbet; leave enough of 
the sherbet to spread over the pudding; 
fill in the center of the mold with 
the pudding mixture, spread on the 
rest of the sherbet, cover with paper 
and with the cover of the mold. Let 
stand packed in three measures of 
crushed ice and one of salt an hour 
or longer. 

Salambo 

Cut a grapefruit in halves, cross- 
wise. With a thin, sharp knife, cut 
around the pulp in each little section 



of the fruit so that the whole of each 
triangular section of pulp may be freed 
from the surrounding membrane and 
lifted out when eaten. Also cut the 
membrane, separating the sections and 
the core from the skin and remove 
all the membrane and the pithy cen- 
ter in one piece. Dispose the halves 
of fruit in grapefruit glasses, then set 
a circle or wreath of red bar-le-duc 
currants around the center of each. 
Powdered sugar may be sprinkled over 
the fruit before the preserve is set 
in place, but will be superfluous for 
most tastes. 

Grape Juice or Raspberry Syllabub 
Mix the juice of one lemon, one cup 
and a half of raspberry or grape juice 
and three-fourths a cup of sugar; when 
the sugar is dissolved, add one pint

of double cream and beat with a whip- 
chum. Stir down the first froth that 
rises, then skim off the froth to a sieve 
to drain. Turn the un whipped mix- 
ture into glasses and pile the froth 
above. Serve, thoroughly chilled, with 
sponge cake or wafers, as a dessert dish. 

Little Pound Cakes 
Beat one-third a cup of butter to 
a cream; beat in half a cup of sugar, 
two egg-yolks, beaten light, half a 
tablespoonful of brandy or milk, three- 
fourths a cup of sifted flour, sifted again 
with half a level teaspoonful of baking 
powder, and one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of mace. Lastly, add the whites of 
two, eggs, beaten dry. Beat the, mix- 
ture thoroughly. Dispose the mixture 
in very small tins; bake in a quick 
oven. Spread a little confectioner's 
frosting on the center of each and 
decorate the frosting with a bit or slice 
of candied cherry. 

Poinsettia Wafers 

Beat half a cup of butter to a cream; 
gradually beat in one cup of granu- 
lated sugar and the grated rind and 
juice of half a lemon, the beaten yolks 
of two eggs and the white of one, 
beaten dry, and, lastly, flour to make 
a dough. Take the dough on the board 
{magic cover is best), a little at a time, 
knead slightly, roll into a sheet, and 



cut into shapes as desired. A cut- 
let cutter was used for the wafers shown 
in the illustration. Set the shapes 
in a buttered pan. brush over with 
the white of an egg, beaten slightly, 
decorate with strips of angelica or 
citron and candied or maraschino cher- 
ries to represent a poinsettia. Dredge 
with granulated sugar. Bake to a 
delicate straw-color. 

Fruit-and-Nut Christmas Cakes 
Beat half a cup of butter to a cream ; 
beat in one cup of sugar, half a cup, 
each, of chopped raisins and chopped 
nuts, two eggs, beaten light without 
separating the whites and yolks, half 
a cup of milk, one cup and a half of 
flour sifted again with two and one- 
half level teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
der. Bake in small tins. Decorate 
with boiled frosting, small, red candies 
chopped pistachio nuts (green) and 
a red candle in a holder. 

Graham Cracker Cake(Miss Reece) 
Beat half a cup of butter to a cream, 
gradually beat in one cup of granulated 
sugar, then the beaten yolks of three 
eggs, one cup and a half of sweet milk, 
one pound of Graham Crackers, rolled 
fine and sifted, then mixed with two 
slightly rounding teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder, and, lastly, the whites of three

Remodeling the Conventional Christmas Dinner 

By Jessamine Chapman Williams 



AMERICAN customs are becom- 
ing more distinctive and char- 
acteristic. We like otir own 
ways of doing things. We have fixed 
ideas regarding our holiday celebrations, 
which are typically American. The 
American ' Christmas celebration is be- 
coming a distinctive one, and while 
we are beginning to prefer the same 
conventional Christmas dinner and 
Christmas dishes, year after year, little 
surprises and variations in the menu 
gives an added delight to the Christmas 
festivities. The same food may be 
served, perhaps, but in a new dress. 
The following Christmas Menu is the 
one usually served in thousands of 
homes, but this may be changed by 
slight variations without offending the 
time-honored customs and conditions 
now so thoroughly established. 

The Usual or Conventional Menu 

Oysters on the half shell. 

Consomme Salted Wafers 

Celery Olives 

Roast Turkey — Plain Dressing 

Mashed Potatoes 

Squash Creamed Onions 

Cranberry Jelly 

Boiled Ham Cabbage Salad 

Plum Pudding Mince and Pumpkin Pies 

Vanila Ice Cream 

Assorted Fruits and Candies 

Coffee 

A Variation of the Above Menu 

Oyster Canapes 
Consomm^ served with Whipped Cream in 



tall chocolate cups. 

Boiled Turkev, Celery Sauce Chestnut Pur6e 

Cranberry l^'rapp^ Baked Stuffed Onions 

Baked Ham with Fried Apple Rings 

Cabbage and Cocoanut Salad in Green reppers 

Plum Pudding Sandwiches 

Pumpkin Pie Tarts, with Whipped Cream 

Mince Pie Ramekins 

Frozen Egg-nog Assorted Fruit and Canditss 

Coffee 

Oyster Canapes 

Instead of the usual raw oyster appe- 
tizer, try this. Grind oysters in the 
meat-grinder and season them as 
for oyster cocktail with Tabasco sauce, 
Worcestershire catsup, celery salt or 
chopped celery, and lemon juice. Spread 
thickly on oblong pieces of buttered 
tog^t, dot- with bits of butter, moisten 
all with the strained oyster liquor, 
which has been heated carefully to 
the boiling point. Heat through in 
a very hot oven. Garnish by placing 
across each end of the toast chopped 
olives, and place a slice of lemon cov- 
ered with chopped parsley on each 
plate. Serve very hot. 

To Vary the Consomme 

Serve a clear Consomm6 very hot 
in tall chocolate cups or iced tea glasses; 
garnish with whipped cream and set 
a straw in each cup to be used instead 
of bouillon spoons. This will add zest 
to the otherwise conventional soup. 



To Boil the Ttirkey 



379 



380 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



The turkey may be stuffed or not, 
as wished, wrapped in cheese cloth 
and plunged into boiling water, using 
as little water as possible. Cover tightly 
and cook very slowly until tender. It 
may be garnished as attractively as 
when roasted, with strings of cran- 
berries, celery leaves, and paper frills. 
To boil the turkey and bake the ham 
will be reversing the process from the 
usual roasted turkey and boiled ham, 
and this change will be enjoyed. 

Serve the Turkey with Celery 

Sauce 

Make a white sauce of the consis- 
tency of gravy. Add stewed celery, 
cut fine, and season well. The giblets, 
chopped fine, may be Added if wished. 
The water in which the turkey is cooked 
may be used with cream for this sauce. 

Cranberry Frappe 

This is sure to appeal to all — a 
cool, tart, refreshing accompaniment 
to the turkey — and a pleasant change 
from the usual jelly or sauce. Cook 
the cranberries as for a sauce, strain, 
add sugar syrup and freeze to a mush. 
Serve in tall Champagne glasses a 
sprig of holly in each. Serve this 
with the turkey. 

Chestnut Pure6 

Substitute for the common mashed 
potato, a chestnut pur6e which looks 
like potato and is a delicious accom- 
paniment to turkey. Boil the chestnuts 
as usual; mash them or put through 
a ricer; add a liberal supply of hot 
cream and butter, season with salt 
and pepper and beat until very light. 
A beaten white of egg may be added 
if wished. 

Garnish the Baked Ham 

With rows of almonds and raisins, 
set alternately in the fat surface. 

Apple Rings 

Are fried in deep fat and sprinkled 



with sugar while draining on paper. 
Place the rings over lapping, around 
the platter of ham. 

Baked Stuflfed Onions 

Creamed onions are the usual ac- 
companiment to roast turkey, but with 
boiled turkey, to bake them is best. 
Remove the centers of the onions after 
parboiling and fill with a mixture of 
chopped nuts and bread crumbs mois- 
tened with melted butter. Add the 
removed centers of the onions. Place 
in a casserole or covered dish, surrotind 
with milk or meat stock and bake 
until tender. Remove the cover, sprin- 
kle buttered bread crumbs over the 
onions and brown quickly. The milk 
should be almost completely absorbed 
in the cooking. Baste occasionally dur- 
ing the process. 

Cabbage-and-Cocoanut Salad 

Cabbage seems to be the customary 
salad for ham or pork. To vary the 
common cabbage salad, the addition 
of cocoanut is a new and pleasant 
change. Shave the cabbage very fine 
and add one-fourth as much shredded 
cocoanut as cabbage; moisten well 
with a cooked cream dressing and 
fill green peppers with the mixture; 
garnish with cream dressing and a 
bit of green pepper or pimientoes cut 
in some fancy shape. Place the pep- 
pers in lettuce nests and serve with 
green pepper sandwiches, if the. salad 
is made a separate course in the 
serving. 

Plum Pudding Sandwiches 

This is a method of serving individual 
portions of pudding Cut the pudding 
likie slices of bread. Spread each piece 
with a hard sauce one-half inch thick, 
cover with another piece of pudding, 
and pour brandy over each sandwich, 
ready to light. Lay a sprig of holly 
on each plate and bring the individual 
plates, aflame, to the table. Pass a 
brandy liquid sauce with the pudding. 



REMODELING THE CHRISTMAS DINNER 



381 



Pumpkin Pie Tarts 

Make the pies in deep patty pans 
and garnish each with whipped cream 
put through the pastry bag. 

Mince Pie Ramekins 

These are made with only one crust 
as the English pies, individual ramekins 
being filled with the hot mince meat, 
and pie crust placed on top. Place 
a piece of Edam cheese on the ramekin 
saucer when served. 

Frozen Egg-Nog 

The Christmas egg-nog is made as 
usual, but frozen and served as an 
appetizing accompaniment to the other 
desserts. An attractive method of serv- 
ing is to fill egg shells, which have 
been opened carefully at the small 
end, with the frozen egg-nog and set 
the shells in egg cups. 

An Old English Christmas 

Dinner 

Roasted Little Pig Boiled Buttered Parsnips 

with Sausage Meat 

Apple Compote Brussels Sprouts 

Boiled Raisin Pudding 

Pheasant Pie Currant Jelly 

Plum Puddine, Brandy and Hard Sauce 

English Mince Pie (deep, one crust) 

Stilton or Cheddar Cheese and Crackers 

Hot Punch (like the old Wassail Bowl) 

No doubt the old ceremony of serv- 
ing up the boar's head on Christmas 
(it is still observed in the hall of Queen's 
College, Oxford) has degenerated into 
serving something of the same nature, 
but really good to eat. The tiny 
pig may be roasted whole and served 
on a huge silver platter, decorated 
with rosemary, with a lemon or apple 
in its mouth, much the same as the 
old time boar'a.head. 

The apple Compote may be used 
together with the sausage, shaped in 
balls as a garnish also for the pig. 

The boiled raisin pudding is a cus- 
tomary accompaniment to fresh pork. 

The vegetables are the usual ones 



served with this dinner and are cooked 
with sauces or other seasoning than 
butter, salt or pepper. 

The Pheasant Pie (often times it 
is a pigeon, or quail or fowl) is a relic 
of the oldtime custom of serving a 
peacock pie at the solemn banquets of 
chivalry, when Knight Errants pledged 
themselves "by cock and pie" to under- 
take some wild and dangerous feat. 
The head of the bird is made to stand 
up above the crust on one side, its 
beak gilded, and the tail at the other 
in all its beautiful plumage. 

The Plum Pudding is decorated with 
holly and is brought in flaming bright 
with burning brandy. It is served 
with hard and liquid sauces. 

The Mince Pie is made with one 
crust, in a deep pudding dish or pan, 
and is served hot. English Cheeses 
and crackers may be served with the 
pie or later with the hot punch. 

The Hot Pimch is a relic also of 
the "Wassail Bowl" so renowned in 
tJie Christmas festivities. It is com- 
posed of ale or wine, highly spiced 
with nutmeg and ginger, sweetened; 
and roasted apples and toast are added. 
The butler serves this from a hugh 
punch bowl in the dining-room after 
the table has been cleared.

382 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



Spiced Apple Compote 

Select red apples, cook in boiling 
water until soft, turning often. Re- 
move skins. To the water add one- 
half cup of sugar, grated rind of a 
lemon, one inch stick cinnamon, the 
juice of one orange. Sumner tmtil 
thick, then pour over the apples. 

Boiled Red Cabbage and Apple 

Slice red cabbage Put one quart 
in a stew pan with two tablespoonfuls 
of butter or fat salt pork, cut in small 
pieces, salt, chopped onion, a few 
gratings of nutmeg, a few grains of 
cayenne and cook tmtil the cabbage 
is nearly tender; then add one pint 
of apples, peeled and sliced very thin. 
The apple should entirely disappear 
in the cooking. More meat, bacon 
or pork can be used and will add flavor. 
This should be well seasoned. 

Carrots— German Style 

Clean and cut carrots in one-half 
inch cubes. Cover with boiling salted 
water and cook until tender. Drain, 
reserving water. Make a drawn but- 
ter sauce using carrot water to which 
has been added a little sugar and 
nutmeg. Pour the sauce, of which 
there should be one-half as much as 
vegetable, over the carrots and cook 
together for five minutes. Serve at 
once. 



Belgian Hare — Sour Cream 

Sauce 

Prepare a hare, split down the back 
and lard it. Brown slices of onion 
in bacon fat; add one cup of stock 
or water and bake, basting often. 
Allow forty-five minutes or one hour 
for baking. Add one cup of thick 
cream and the juice of a lemon, or 
one cup of sour cream and cook fifteen 
minutes longer, basting often. Pour 
the sauce around the hare and serve. 
The sauce may be strained and thick- 
ened if preferred. 

Kohl-Rabi Salad — Parisian 
Dressing 

Cook Kohl-rabi until tender in boil- 
ing salted water to cover. Drain, cool, 
and serve cold as a salad, over which 
is poured a French dressing, which 
has added to it chopped parsley red 
and green peppers, grated onion and 
celery salt. 

The German Christmas Cakes are 
infinite in number. Many are made 
with a basis of almond paste. These 
can be ordered in cities from German 
bakeries. It would not be a typical 
German menu without the famous 
Christmas Cakes. 

The Salad is usually served before 
the main course. If a soup is served, 
it is usually a vegetable and meat 
soup, well seasoned.

If You Give Money 

MONEY is oftentimes the most ac- 
ceptable present one may give at 
Christmas time, especially where 
the tastes of the recipient are unknown. 
But it should be given in some novel, 
attractive manner, to relieve it of its 
cold, impersonal touch and to render 
it as Christmasy in effect as other 
gifts. Here are some unusual methods 
that have proven successful. It seems 
useless to say that the money should 
be crisp and new. 

A long narrow box, such as pepper- 
mint chocolates sometimes come in, 
was filled by one woman with half 
dollars and labeled " Mint Wafers," 
then wrapped and tied in true Christ- 
mas fashion. Another box labeled the 
same was so in two senses of the words. 
Some new dimes were thoroughly steri- 
lized and then pressed into the centers 
of some home-made mint wafers before 
they hardened. 

The little glass jars that are filled 
with tiny sticks of candy gave another 
woman an idea. She rolled new one 
dollar bills into neat cylinders and 
wound narrow red ribbon around them 
to simulate sticks of candy. These 
were put into the glass jar and made 
a very gay appearance. 

Still another woman procured dimes 
to the amount of five dollars and, 
stacking them neatly, wrapped the 
cylinder in holly paper and tied it 
with ribbon. One might substitute a 
dollar bill for the holly paper. 



A small boy in his first trousers 
received a little purse filled to bursting 
with pennies. "Reddy money" was 
the inscription it bore. A girl noted 
for her bookish tastes was once pre- 
sented with a most odd and convenient 
little book. It's title was "Notes of 
American Travel," and it consisted 
of tea one dollar bills bound together 
with Bristol board covered, with holly 
paper and the title written with gold 
paint. 

A most dainty rafBa basket, shaped 
like a market basket, was filled with 
new coins of all denominations and 
on the card attached to the handle 
was written "Fresh from the money 
market." This gift was a contribu- 
tion of some children to their house- 
wifely mother. 

A temporary invalid was surprised 
with a holly-covered powder box bear- 
ing a white label with this prescrip- 
tion: "Soothing Powders. To be taken 
in a financial panic. Kris Krinkle, 
Doctor." The box was filled with 
bills, each wrapped like a powder in 
white paper. One need not be an inva- 
lid, however, to appreciate this sort 
of gift. 

One boy wanted a motor cycle lamp, 
so his sister gave him the money for 
it in his stocking. A number of small 
gifts, such as rings, pins or cuff-buttons, 
from the other relatives, were wrapped 
in dollar bills instead of the usual tissue 
paper, and several more bills were 
stuffed carelessly in the stocking, while 
the last one, a five dollar note, was

daintily wrapped in tissue paper and 
red ribbon dang with her card, upon 
which she had written "$1 + 1 + 1 + 1+1 
+ 1 + 1 + 5=one motorcycle lamp." 

A clever way is to use a series of 
envelopes, graduated to fit into each 
other, each bearing a verse or line, 
all pointing toward the gift of money, 
which should be enclosed in the last 
envelope. 

Quite the quaintest conceit I ever 
saw was a tiny doll dressed in bank 
lotes. The sldrt was a five dollar 
bill plaited and fastened to the waist 
by red ribbon. A cape of another 
bill, plaited in the same manner, adorned 
the shoulders, and another bill was 
wotmd around the head for a bonnet. 

It remained for a girl with an artistic 
bend to transform her gold into a 
thing of beauty With a bit of glue 
she fastened a five dollar gold piece 
to the center of her calling card and 
around it, arranged some petals from 
an artificial daisy. It was sent in 
a box lined with green cotton and 
was, indeed, a daisy with a heart of gold. 

A veritable Lady Bounty sent her 
son's family a large cake in which 
were baked a great number of coins 
ranging in value from a dime to a 
five dollar gold piece. The family 
were unaware of the ''richness" of 
their cake until they began to cut it, 
and not tmtil the last piece had been 
devoured were they able to realize its 
total wealth. Needless to say, the 
cake had no chance to grow stale ! m. b . b.

Cold Weather Duties 

WITH the first cool days of early 
fall, the housekeeper commences 
to formulate plans to make her family 
comfortable for the coming of winter, 
and her duties become more exacting, 
because so much depends upon the 
atmosphere of the house. In summer 
the normal person lives so much out 
of doors, windows and doors are con- 
stantly open; tlaere is no care as to 



the heating of the house; social duties 
are of an informal character, and one 
takes life more easily. The gradual 
approach of winter brings such a change, 
from a house constantly open to the 
fresh breezes and direct sunlight to 
one almost constantly closed, that a 
little advice, on how to keep the rooms 
sweet, well-ventilated, and properly 
heated, will not come amiss. 

Healthful animal or vegetable life 
cannot be sustained without fresh air 
in plenty. With the first chilly days 
we are apt to forget this and so keep 
the house too carefully closed against 
the air. Living in rooms that have 
not a proper supply of pure air lowers 
the vitality and makes one feel the 
cold much more. It is an error to 
think a house can be kept warmer 
without fresh air than with it. 

Air the sleeping rooms the first thing 
in the morning. Have at least one 
window in the upper hall in which 
a ventilator can be placed; or if that 
be inconvenient, have a strip of board 
about four or five inches wide set 
under the lower sash. This will give 
fresh air without a draught, and is 
a good way to ventilate sleeping rooms, 
when one fears an open window. Always 
keep some rooms warm, while the others 
are being aired, then give them a thor- 
ough flooding with fresh air, when 
the first rooms are comfortable. The 
kitchen with its odors should be opened 
to the sunshine at every opportimity. 
It is a good plan to have a kitchen 
window opened always a few inches 
at the top. Then from the opened 
door there comes a draught that carries 
the impure air out of the window. 

Fall cleaning need not be as energetic 
as that of spring. The walls need to 
be wiped down, as they are likely to 
harbor dust, the result if opening 
doors. Screens should be taken down, 
cleaned thoroughly, and wiped well 
with oil, to prevent rusting while in 
storage. 

Although electric lights and gas are 



HOME IDEAS AND ECONMIES

in general use, they have not altogether 
displaced the kerosene lamp as yet, 
and in fact there are many house- 
wives who prefer the old style lamp. 
But tmless a lamp is kept in clean 
condition, it will furnish a poor flicker- 
ing light, and give off unpleasant odors. 
Therefore lamp cleaning becomes a 
part of each winter day's routine, 
and the best time for the task is in 
the morning, since filling lamps by 
artificial light has been the cause of 
many a serious accident. 

See that * the fruit cellar is properly 
cleaned and in fit sanitary condition, 
for housing the winter's supply. An 
even temperature shotdd be maintained. 
As much fruit is lost through a foul 
cellar as by imperfect sealing. 

The care of the plumbing is an 
important duty. The housekeeper 
should see, at least once a day, to the 
thorough flushing of all pipes. The 
best time for this is after the morn- 
ing's work is done. After the mid-day 
work is done, and again at night, the 
pipe in the kitchen sink should be 
thoroughly flushed with hot water, 
if possible. Once a week put half 
a pint of washing soda in an old sauce 
pan and add six quarts of hot water, 
place on the fire until the soda is dis- 
solved, then pour the water in the pipes, 
reserving two quarts of it for the kit- 
chen sink. M. c. K.

A Progressive Gift for an Invalid 

WHEN half a continent stretches 
between one and an aged, shut- 
in friend, it is difficult indeed to think 
of a suitable gift. A California woman 
has solved the problem in this fashio'n: 
She writes to her aged mother: 

"The enclosed ten dollars is for a 
continuous 'treat.' Every time Sister 
goes down 'town she must bring home 
some frivolous thing — something you 
do not need, and therefore would 
not buy. It may be a box of mints 
or chocolates, a bag of nuts, or, per- 



haps, a lot of California fruit which 
you can play came direct from our 
orchards." 

** Other people who can go down 
town enjoy treating themselves and 
their friends, but you can do your 
ordering, and then treat the people 
who come to see you. 

"But hurry up and spend this, for 
another ten is coming soon." 

Now every invalid knows how much 
such little things count, the coming 
in of a surprise package, the candy- 
box hid under the pillow to be opened 
occasionally in the long wakeful hours 
of the night, the pleasant sharing with 
a caller, or something to give a little 
child. And to always have a treat 
on hand — ah, that is being rich when 
one is shut in. 

Surely a progressive gift like this 

is better than a big one with a big 

thrill, soon over! l. m. c.

Some Swiss Dishes 
White Soup 

2 quarts of white stock 1 head of celery 

1 medium parsnip 1 cup of mushrooms 

1 cup of thin cream or 1 cup of milk with 1 egg 

yolk, well beaten 
Dash of curry poWder or speck of garlic 

Cook parsnip, celery and. mushrooms 
in stock until soft enough to rub through 
wire sieve; put pulp back into stock, 
add cream, or milk and egg mixture; 
carefully reheat to boiling point. Flavor 
with salt, speck of white pepper and 
dash of curry or about a large pea-size 
of garlic, crushed to pulp. Serve with 
tiny diamonds of bread, dried over 
night in oven, so they are quite white 
but very crisp. 

Red Cabbage Hot 

Slice or chop one small good head 
of red cabbage fine and throw into 
boiling water with speck of soda, 
cook fast for 30 minutes. Drain not 
quite dry, add generously of butter, 
some salt and two tablespoonfuls of 
naild vinegar (here they use sour wine).

MANY people have diflEiculty in 
cooking a small roast of beef 
perfectly, but I am sure, if they will 
carry out the following directions, they 
will succeed in having a perfectly cooked 
roast. Have your beef boned and 
rolled and be sure to tie it very securely. 
Allowing an hour for a four-pound 
roast, divide the time of cooking. Put 
your roast in a good hot oven and 
let remain half an hour, then remove 
from the oven and let it stand on the 
side table half an hour, returning it 
to the oven half an hour before serving 
time. I have done this since I dis- 
covered it three years ago and my 
only theory is that the cold air forces 
the heat towards the center and, con- 
sequently, every part of the meat is 
done equally well. Even when I roast 
my beef in a paper bag I follow out the 

same rule. h. i. s.

A song of anguished heartache 

Went winging with the night. 

Straight to the gates of sorrow 

It took its aimless flight; 

And hearts grown gray with grieving, 

Eager to unlearn pain. 

It stabbed again with sadness 

Till teardrops fell like rain. 



Songs 



A little song of gladness 
Went dancing with the day — 
Love of a lad and lassie 
Adown a flowered way, — 
But light with silver foot-fall 
And sweet as Springtime rain 
It roused in each heart perfume — 
A dream of lover's lane.

a cup of butter; shake the pan to melt 
the cheese and butter and distribute 
them evenly over the spaghetti. 

Spaghetti, Italian Style (No. 2) 

Cook the spaghetti as before and 
let stand to keep hot. Melt one-fourth 
a cup of butter: in it cook one-fourth 
a cup of flour and half a teaspoonful, 
each, of salt and pepper; add one cup, 
each, of tomato puree and rich brown 
stock (broth flavored with onion, car- 
rot and celery) and stir until the sauce 
boils; pour the sauce over the niacaroni 
and add two or three ounces of grated 
cheese; lift the spaghetti, with a spoon 
and fork to mix the ingredients thor- 
oughly; let stand over hot water until 
very hot, then serve. The spaghetti 
may be broken in pieces about two 
inches in length before cooking, or, 
the whole lengths may be slowly coiled 
aroimd in the boiling water and kept 
whole for serving. Americans usually 
break the spaghetti in pieces before 
cooking. 

Noodles 

To three eggs, slightly beaten, add 
a few grains of salt and enough flour 
to make a stiff dough; knead fifteen 
or twenty minutes; roll into a sheet 
as thin as paper (a piece of duck or 
a "magic cover" is the best surface 
upon which to roll the paste.) Let 
stand, covered with a doth, about 
half an hour, to dry the surface. Roll 
the paste loosely like a jelly roll, then 
cut into very narrow threads or into 
ribbons one-fourth an inch wide. Sep- 
arate the threads or ribbons and let 
stand an hour or more to dry. Cook 
about fifteen minutes in rapidly boil- 
ing salted water.

a cup, each, of butter and flour, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth a 
teaspoonful of pepper and two cups 
of white stock or milk, or half of each. 

Salmon Timbales (Raw Fish) 

i a pound of raw salmon 1 cup of double cream 

2 egg yolks (raw) 2 egg-whites, beaten 

1 tablespoonful of butter dry 

1 tablespoonful of flour i a teaspoonful of salt 

} a cup of chicken or I a teaspoonful of 

fish broth pepper 

The salmon is weighed after the re- 
moval of all unedible portions. As 
purchased rather less than a pound is 
needed. Scrape the pulp from the 
fibres and pound to a smooth con- 
sistency; add the yolks and pound again. 
Before pounding the fish make a sauce 



of ^the butter, flour, salt and pepper 
as needed and the broth, and let this 
cool. Add to the fish and egg mixture 
and pound again; then fold in the 
whites of eggs, beaten dry, and the 
cream, beaten firm, also the salt and 
pepper. Thoroughly grease the inside 
of timbale molds with softened butter, 
then sprinkle with capers or chopped 
parsley and set aside to chill, when 
the decoration will be held in place. 
Fill the molds with the fish preparation, 
tapping them on the table, meanwhile, 
that the mixture may settle firm in 
the molds. Cook in the oven, on 
folds of paper and surrounded by boil- 
ing water until firm in the center. 
Serve with Hollandaise, drawn butter 
or fish Bechamel sauce. Capers may 
be added to the drawn butter sauce. 

Use of Rosemary and Kale in

Rosemary is an aromatic herb used 
for marinating fish and some special

Dorothy Brooke Across the Sea. By 
Frances Caupbell Sparhawk. 
Cloth, m. Price. $1.50; New York; 
Thomas Y. Crowell Company. 
This is the fifth and final volume of 
the Dorothy Brooke books. It Is prob- 
ably, also, the best of the series. In 
it Dorothy goes abroad with her friend, 
Pell-Mell, and sees men and things. 
The scenes and events of the trip are 
beautifully described, and the modest 
bearing of the charming heroine loses 
naught of its fascination. 

The experience of a yotmg woman 
13 always interesting; that of Dorothy 
Brooke is of a most sweet and lovable 
young woman. The story ends with 
her happy marriage. In this series 
of story books, now well known, Miss 
Sparhawk has portrayed in her heroine 



a character that is clean, wholesome 
and above reproach. No suspicion of 
taint can be found in these volumes. 
They are eminently fitted to find a 
place in the clean and healthy atmo- 
sphere of homes where yoimg girls 
and boys are growing to maturity. 
They are an inspiration to noble living. 

Recipes and Menus for Fifty, as used 
in the School oj Domestic Science 
of the Boston Young Woman's 
Christian Association. By Fran- 
ces Lowe Smith. Cloth, Price, 
♦1.50 postpaid; Boston; Whitcomb 
and Barrows. 
The author says: "The object in 
publishing this collection of recipes 
and menus is twofold — to put them 
in a convenient and accessible form 
for our own graduates, who find them 
invaluable in their various fields of 
work, and for others who need tried 
and definite recipes for use in small 
institutions. 

This is not a complete cook-book, 
although it furnishes material for a 
sufficiently varied menu. The recipes 
are those used by students in the pre- 
paration of meals in the school-home 
kitchen, as distinct from the laboratory; 
and have been collected and adapted, 
during a period of eleven years, from 
various sources — from personal ex- 
periments, from the school laboratory- 
recipes, from student-matrons, and from 
numerous cook-books. 

The recipes are given just as used 
in the kitchen of the School of Domestic 
Science, but a word of explanation 
is necessary. Our students are women 
living an indoor, serai-sedentary life, 
and are comparatively light - eaters. 
The conditions also are such that it 
is possible to plan more closely as to 
quantities than is usually practicable 
elsewhere. For these reasons, the quan- 
tities given will sometimes be insuffi-

Good cooking 
is largely a matter 
of proper seasoning 



THE importance of knowing 
what seasoning to use and 
how to use it so that it will 
blend properly with the food being

Knowing how to use just the 
right amount of the right kind of 
seasoning is essential to good 
cookery, 

Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer has pre- 
pared a new book of recipes which 
will help any woman to a better 
knowledge of seasoning and will per- 
haps introduce somenew and unique 
dishes to her culinary repertoire.

A 1 book of this character is often 
called for by those who are engaged 
in catering where large numbers are 
to be fed. How this is done in one 
successfully conducted institution will 
undoubtedly be of asristance to many 
another who is likewise eng^ed. It

Tkt Grocer's Bncyclopatdia.^ By Astb- 
HAS Ward. Qoth, lU. Price. 
$10.00: New York; 50 Union Square. 
This is 8 compendium of useful infor- 
mation concerning foods of all kinds; 
how they are raised, prepared and mar> 
keted; how to care for them in Aore 
and home; how best to use and esjoy 
them; and much other information 
for grocers, general store-keepers and 
markets. The Encyclopaedia attempts 
to give some information on every 
known article of food and drink. There 
are eighty full-page plates in color, 
and four hundred and forty-nine illus- 
trations. All these are excellent. The 
colored plates are the finest we have 
ever seen. In every respect it is a 
great and superb work.

eggs, beaten dry. Bake in three layer 
cake pans about twenty-five minutes. 
Put the layers together with Mocha

ing. Use a pastry bag and very small 
five-pointed tube, in piping the frosting. 
The cake may be baked in a dripping 
pan and cut into individual cakes.

and oven — push the knob to "Kindle", 
"Bake", or "Check" — the range does tl^e rest. 
Better than two or more dampers. Have 
you seen it? This Single Damper is

The D-oss Squirrel 

Once there was a squirrel that did 
not like his home, and he used to scold 
and find fault with everything. His 
papa squirrel had long, gray whiskers, 
and so was wise — besides which he 
could shake his whiskers quickly. 

"My dear, as you do not like your 
home, there are three sensible things 
you could do : — 

"Leave it, or change it, or suit your- 
self to it. Any one of these would 
help you in your trouble." 

But the squirrel said, — 

"Oh, I do not want to do any of 
those: I would rather sit on a branch 
of a tree and scold." 

"Well," said the papa squirrel, "if 
you must do that, whenever you want 
to scold, just go out on a branch and 
scold away at some one you do not 
know," 

The little squirrel blushed so much 
that he became a red squirrel, and you 
will notice to this day red squirrels 
do just that thing. — Selected. 

Knew her Rights 

"I tell you I won't have this room," 
protested the old lady to the boy ia 
buttons who was conducting her, "I 
ain't goin* to pay my money for a 
pigsty with a measly little foldin' bed 
in it. If you think that just because 
I'm from the country " 

Profoundly disgusted, the boy cut her 
short. "Get in, mum. get in," he 
ordered. "This ain't yer room. This 
is the elevator." 



"Ye have a fine bunch of boys, Mike," 
said one Irishman to another, "Indeed 
I have, and I've never had need to 
raise hand against 'em exdpt in self- 

difince!"

In BriUat-Savaiin's great work, "The 
Physiology of Taste," are axi(»ns as 
profound — at least, as entertaining — 
as ever Plato or Bpictetus set down. 
For example: 

"Digestion, of all bodily functions, 
has most influence on the morals of the 
individual." 

"A good dinner is but little dearer 
than a bad one." 

"The most momentous dedstons of 
persona] and of material life are made 
at table." 

"The fate of nations depends on bow 
they are fed." 

"The man of sense and culture alone 
understands eating." 

"The discovery of a new dish does 
more for the happiness of the human 
race than the discovery of a planet." — 
Exchange. 

Deep breathing aids digestion, en- 
courages liver and bowel action, develops 
the lungs, and purifies the blood. The 
only directions needed are: Hold the 
chest high and breathe as deep as you 
can ten or twenty times every hour, 
or oftener. The best "breath" gym- 
nastics are swimming, hill-climbing, and 
rapid walking or running. Always 
breathe through the nose. In walldng, 
always hold the chest high and carry 
it well to the front. Swing the arms 
moderately, and walk fast enough to 
hasten the breathing a httle. Nine 
miles a day at the rate of three miles 
an hour is the proper distance for the 
average adult. Most housekeepers and 
laborers do more. 



An English rector preached a s 
sermon on the eternal fate of the 
wicked. Meeting an old woman noted 
for her gossiping disposition, he said 
to her: "I hope my sermon has borne 
fruit in your mind. You heard what 
I said about that place where there 
shall be wailing and gnashing ctf teet^?" 
"Well, as to that," answered the dame, 
"if I 'as anything to say, it be this: 
Let them gnash their teet^as 'as 'em, — 
I ain't!" — Youth's Companion.

All of the trouble that the housewife 
has with Canned Foods is caused by 
imperfect tin cans or difficulty in open- 
ing the can. 

Occasionally the solder used in mak- 
ing the can does not run evenly, caus- 
ing a very slight hole which allows the 
air to gradually leak into the can, re- 
sulting in an accumulation of gas and 
spoilage of the contents. Such cans 
always show the presence of gas by 
puffing or swelling at the top or bottom. 

Before opening a tin of Canned Foods 
of any kind, whether they be packed 
at home or not, you should examine 
the top and bottom, and if they are 
convex or puffed it is a sure indication 
that the contents is spoiled and should 
be discarded. 

If the can is perfect you can be sure 
that the contents are in perfect con- 
dition. In opening remove the label 
so that you can see the seam on the 
side of the can; lay the can on its side 
and insert the can-opener right next 
to this seam and very close to the 
top. Now hold the can firmly on the 
table in an upright position and work 
the can-opener away from the seam 
until you have cut entirely around 
the can. You will then be able to 
turn back the entire top, and if the 
can is held firmly there is no danger 
of cutting the hands and the fruit 
will not be mutilated when it is poured 
from the tin. 



Robert: "Mamma, my stomach sa>-s 
it is dinner time." Mamma: "You'd 
better go and see what time it is." 
Robert (after an inspection of the clock) : 
"Well, mamma, my stomach's three 
minutes fast." — Life.

S EVIDENCE of what we italed in oui pteviMH

SILVER-CLEAN PAN 

ii now a necenity, we quote from an article in The 
Housekeeper Magazme, March 1912 iuue, over the 
Hgnature o( Margaret Soundittoot, Teachers CoHege, 
Columhia University, as follows: 

"The task (^ silvct cleaning need not appall the 

housekeeper, as there it, for instance, now on the market 

a SILVER-CLEAN PAN thai, as its maker My^ 

" makes the tarnish vanish like clouds before the morning 

sun." In using this all that one hst lo do is to place the 

htJ«.ll,l«l.«JAi,.U,II« ,^rticle^ to be cleaned (gold « »aver) in the pan in a 

solution of warm water, baking soda and ordinary table salt, leaving ihem there from one to five 

minute*. All thai it then required is lo rinse the silver and dry it with a clean chamois skb or 

toll cloth. In fact, this pan does away with all the dreaded labor of cleaning the silver. Elalxv 

rale silver, such as toilet articles, may be cleaned in the tame way with no effort whatsoever. 

Not the slightest injury is done the silver and it will have a lutlei like new." 

It seems useless for us lo say mote, as undoubtedly most of the subtciibert to this magazine 
ue acquainted with Margaret Soundslrom's writiDgs on Domestic Science, and further know she 
would not recommend it before making a thorough test and research as lo its merits. '

Since its original publication, Miss Farmer's ^'Boston Cooking 
School Cook Book" has, in new editions, incorporated large addi- 
tions, but the wealth of new material— rthe result of experiments 
in the author's class rooms and embodied in recipes which have 
been thoroughly tested — has grown to such an extent that it has 
become necessary to incorporate it in a separate volume which 
forms an almost indispensable companion to the author's invalu- 
able ''Boston Cooking School Cook Book." 

The "New Book of Cookery" contains more than eight hun- 
dred recii>es upon all branches, including many new and import- 
ant dishes not to be found in any other worL It is prof usdy

PJIT of this book appeared seriaUy in this magazine and met with such favor as to wanrant 
its publication in book (onn. The chapteis that were in the magazine have been rewritten 
and enlarged, and about as many more entirely new chapters (37 chapters in aD) added, 
together with some dozen or more iOlustrations. 

TniS Book is for the use of those teaching Cooking in the Elementary Schools, 
and we believe such teachers will derive more help from this book than from any odier yet 
published. 

Tills Book has been adopted as a text book by many High Schools. 
1 niS Book is used as a text book in several State Normal Schools. 

Every Cookiiig Teacher needs this book

Jack voiced the trouble with all of 
us but Grace. 

" Hang it! Mater. " — he had been 
a hundred in Latin the day before — 
" I'd rather ten times over live in 
the old house and have the big yard 
to loaf in." 

John and I looked at each other 
in silent approval. It was not so 
much the " big yard " with us as 
leaving the house which had par- 
taken so largely of our Joy, and 
that had infolded us with protecting 
tenderness, when sorrow threatened 
to overwhelm us. 

And then Grace set up a protest 
that by its very vigor saddled her 
wi;h a new name. 

" I think," I ventured timidly, 
" that this house might be made 
pretty livable with a few changes 
and some new furniture." 

" New furniture! " snorted Jack 
contemptuously. " when you have 
an attic full of grandmother's old 
stuff. What you want is an up- 



holsterer and a refinisher." 

At that I saw a great light and so 
did John. His face fairly beamed 
while he rubbed his hands together 
in a sort of approving ecstacy, 
which proved his good nature, as it 
was my mother's " stuff." 

" We can't — I'll never — I — Oh ! 
it's bad enough to live in an old 
house — but to have to sit on old 
furniture — I think it would be too 
dreadful ! I want a new house and — 
new — fur — furniture." Graceended 
with a frank sob and a blind search 
for a handkerchief. 

"She wants things new and shiny," 
said Jack with scorn. " Varnish! 
She ought to be named Varnish, 
that's what she had." 

And he called her Varnish. ?ifter 
that, whenever she tried to obstruct 
the remodeling of the old house, 
which was so often that the name 
finally stuck so fast that the poor 
child could not shake it off. Time 
has softened it to Varnie, and Varnie

STORY OF AN INTERIOR 



THE PARLOR 



she will be to the end of her chapter. 

We began by converting the kitchen 
into a dining-room, and making a 
new kitchen by throwing a big 
pantry and an old-fashioned " sink- 
room " together. To the old dining- 
room we added a bay and some 
built-in bookcases and we had a 
library or living room over twenty 
feet long by sixteen wide. Our 
former living room became the " par- 
lor." The old kitchen was sixteen 
feet square, with a big chimney of 
some kind on one side. We did not 
know exactly what it was, for it had 
been bricked up and boarded across. 
We thought there might be a fire- 
place, because there was a sunken 
brick hearth upon which our range 
stood poised upon blocks of varying 
thickness. 

We tore off the boards and took 
out the bricks, and, lo! the old fire- 
place, within which so many gen- 
erations had cooked their meals, and 
the brick oven, where so many savory 
loaves had browned, stood revealed. 



The fireplace was in perfect repair 
even to the eye for holding the crane 
but the hearth was giving way and 
the oven was falling down. We 
replaced the bricks in the hearth 
with a stone, and in the process 
found a " foot-hook " used for draw- 
ing out the crane. It was made 
from a naturally crooked root, with 
one end whittled to represent a foot. 
It is the only thing of the kind I 
have ever come across. 

We took out the oven and fash- 
ioned a china closet where it had 
been. We left the wood mantel 
and the paneling over it, but above 
the panels we extended a plate shelf. 
We also left the horizontal paneled 
wainscoting and the " cross-doors." 
The wall we covered with a deep 
canary -colored paper and had the 
wood work and moulding painted a 
leather color. 

The living room was finished in 
oak, with bookcases to match. On 
the walls we used a plain Drown 
paper with a golden tone, topped with 



430 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



an oak moulding. The parlor wood- 
work was enameled in white, and a 
soft, pale green paper was placed on the 
walls with white moulding above. 
The bedroom, which opened off the 
library, had a grayish brown paper 
that toned well with the high, old- 
fashioned, black-walnut furniture. 
All the ceilings were papered with the 
same cream-colored paper. Space 
for double folding doors was cut 
between the parlor and the living 
room. 

Adjoining what had formerly been 
the kitchen was a roomy porch, where 
the maid had done the washing in 
summer, and where the cat had 
shivered in winter, when she was 
in disgrace for too much investiga- 
tion. This we lighted, and converted 
into a summer living room, where 
in daytime we could look over the 
shadow-swept lawn, and at night 
could read, or doze, or play a game 
of whist. 

Then we made a raid on the attic. 
After we had begun the unearthing, 
Jack became wildly enthusiastic, while 



Grace plainly sulked. And really, 
it was rather a sorry sight. The 
furniture was dtngy and dilapidated, 
and 'the old Staffordshire ware covered 
with the dust of decades. And the 
baskets, which had held the mending 
and the food of by-gone generations, 
were disreputable looking affairs. But 
it is remarkable what energy, and 
soap, and a good cabinet maker, 
can accomplish with the genuine 
contents of an old attic. 

The hand-carved mahogany chairs 
and davenport we had refinished 
and upholstered in green and gold 
.and . old-rose haircloth, for which 
"a fifty-year-old flowery carpet fur- 
nished a good setting. Jack made a 
raid on the store-room of a great 
aunt and came home triumphant 
with some opal -glass curtain knobs, 
and a pair of glass dolphin candle- 
sticks that are so old that the holders 
are of pewter. These gave the 
antique finish that was needed to 
complete the parlor. 

Grandfather's walnut chest, which 
he had made himself, was refinished.

and placed underneath grandmother's 
gilt-framed looking-glass with the 
painted picture, which hung in the 
bedroom. The bed was covered with 
an old, hand-woven coverlid, as was 
the couch in the living-room. The 
one on the bed is the unusual 
grape- vine pattern, with the most 
interesting border I have ever seen. 
It has in it the motto, " E Pluribus 
Unum," the flag, the eagle holding 
the arrows, and the state house. 
The other is the sunburst pattern 
with a beautiful rose and bird border. 
The result of our work was satis- 
factory to John and me, and eminently 
so to Jack. Before the final touches 
were put on I sent the children to an 
aunt for a month's visit. I wanted 
them to see the finished product, 



but not the making of it. 

When Jack caught his first view, 
his hat went up in the air and he 
caught me and swung me in a dizzy 
whirl. "It's great! It's glorious!" 
he shouted. 

Grace — Varnie by this time — 
did not seem especially depressed, 
but of course, logically, she coulr* 
not approve. 

" Look at your hat on the floor! " 
she exclaimed. " If we had a new 
house, we would have a hall where 
you could hang it." 

" Hang a hall! " he retorted, 
" What's a hall compared to a big 
treey lawn — and this," — he spread 
wide his arms comprehensively. 
" Varnishl " he added, contempt- 
uously. 



EPOQUE LOUIS XVI. 



Hie Ornamental Clocks of France 



By Frances Sheafer Waxman 

^HERE was a time, not so pretentions, whatever, possessed an 
very long ago. when every onyx or marble French clock. This 
American household of any ornament was proudly ensconced on 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



The French clock, as it has been 
copied and distributed throughout 
the world, is certainly out of key 
with most of the surroundings in 
which it finds itself, for the clock in 
France was from the first regarded 
as much as an ornament as a utility, 
and it was designed to fit the sump- 
tuous'' interiors of the days when 
Prance led the world in her luxurious 
living appointments. The marvelous 
workmen of the Louis periods did 
not neglect the clock, in their selection 
of a field for the display of their 
talents. They may have been in- 
difEerent mechanicians, but they were 
designers without peer, and no doubt 
many a reproduction of their work 
has found its way to this country, 
to be relegated, at last, to some totally 
unsympathetic environment, very far 
away in taste and intention from 
the scenes and the inspiration which 
first called it into existence. 



EPOQUB REGBkCE 



the mantle shelf, together with such 
bric-a-brac as was deemed worthy 
to share its conspicuous position. 
Not infrequently, when the clocks 
were of gilded bronze, they were 
covered with the bell glass, once used 
to preserve wax flowers from the dust. 
Whatever has become of all those 
wax groups of fruit and flowers? 
Being useless decorations they have 
disappeared, probably to the remotest, 
dustiest corners of the family attic. 
The clocks though, having a genuine 
raison d'etre, and being moreover 
excellent time-keepers, remain to 
mark the passing of a fashion in 
decoration that sometimes sets us 
wondering if the Mission style is, 
after all, an improvement on those 
that have gone before. 



EPOQUE LOUIS XV. 



THE ORNAMENTAL CLOCKS OF FRANCE 



433 



The earliest French clocks were of 
two quite opposed sizes: the great 
city clocks which told the time from 
the tower of the town hall, and the 
tiny ornamental bibelots which oc- 
cupied a place of honor on the tables 
of princely apartments. Many of 
the famous town clocks are still 
doing du1?y in their original settings. 
The beautiful clock at Bruges has 
inspired many a poet to sing of its 
musical chimes, and the historic 
time-piece has clung to its old- 
fashioned habits, for it has even 
to-day to be wound four times every 
twenty-four hours. The indoor, port- 
able clocks were considered an im- 
portant invention, when they first 
appeared, and every one, who could 
afford hastened to order one so that 
he ** might know the time wherever 
he might be.** They were made of 
real precious metals, and embellished 
with much hand-made ornament. 
Silver and gold inlays were common, 
as was, later, the beautiful mar- 
quetry for which the • eighteenth 
century wood- workers were renowned. 

Truth to tell, these elaborate clocks 
kept rather inaccurate count of the 
passage of time. They had a great 
many functions to perform besides 
telling the hours. They had appli- 
ances that marked the tides, the 
courses of the planets, the rising of 
the sun and moon, the eclipses, and 
a lot of other more or less useful 
information. Often they had very 
intricate, mechanical, toy attach- 
ments, and were equipped with a 
variety of little figures which went 
through quite complicated gyrations 
every time the clock struck. There 
would be graceful ladies, with a 
troup of trained monkeys, who had 
to perform in order that the onlooker 
might know it was twelve o'clock. 
Cocks crew, victories crowned kings, 
armed knights drilled, birds sang, 
every time the hour passed. It 



was a conspicuous way of telling 
them off, at a*ny rate. 

Even in the reign of Louis XIV 
clocks were looked upon as of suffi- 
cient novelty to be given as kingly 
gifts, and many an ambassadorial 
visitor to the Court went away with, 
not one, but, perhaps, a dozen small 
clocks of exquisite make. Things 
were done on a magnificent scale at 
the Court of France during the Sun 
King's reign. 

It was at a somewhat later date 
that clocks took up their position 
on the chimney shelf, a place they 
have since unquestioningly held. In 
France they formed, with two vases 
and two pendant candlesticks, a 
group known as a *' chimney-trim- 
ming." Since, at that time, all 
chimneys had their mirrors, the 
clock-makers were obliged to take 
account of the fact that the reverse 
of their time pieces was also visible, 
and hence had to be treated "in 
the round," much as a statue would 
be. 

Wall clocks had a vogue in France 
and, at one time, the tall standing 
clock of our Colonial days was 
made there in a somewhat glorified 
form. The case was naturally given 
every attention as a medium to 
exploit the wood-worker's and the 
metalist's art. Many of the best 
examples of these clocks have been 
preserved in the French museums 
and may be seen and studied still 
by the interested traveler. Nothing 
like them is made now-a-days, ex- 
cept as copies of these good old 
models. We have not time to spend 
years, as did the people of other days, 
in arriving at mere perfection • of 
form. On the other hand, we can 
and do make more accurate and 
reliable time-keepers than could the 
most gifted of the artisans of^long 
ago. In our day science has .made 
greater strides than art. 



Two City Girls Pioneering in Arizona 

By Julia Davis Chandler 



THE day of the canvas-covered 
ox-wagon is past. We helped 
these girls pack to go by the 
express train of to-day from a big 
Eastern city. Smart in spring toggery 
they looked, alert and bright, just they 
two, bag and baggage, to join a young 
married sister whose husband had lo- 
cated a claim in a newly settled valley 
of Arizona. She was lonely; there was 
the first baby in the family to be seen; 
would not her two sisters come out there 
and take up a quarter section close by, 
while the land was to be had? 

And so, leaving a big Pennsylvania 
home, "up-state" and city office posi- 
tion that one held, and a fine nursing 
practice the elder had established, the 
two set forth, not scuttling all their 
ships, for they frankly said: "If we do 
not like it, if we do not succeed, we 
shall return." 

First came a picture postal, a queer 
scene, purchased while aboard the "tour- 
ist sleeper," that one may take at 
Washington, or Chicago, and not change 
thereafter; on it they said all was going 
well and salt pretzels and peppermints 
had averted car-sickness. Then came 
the following accotmt of their experiences 
during the first six weeks. 

"Dear Folkses at home:" 

"For this letter is written to the 
whole family, as we do when we write 
home. We have been out here now 
almost six weeks, but it really doesn't 
seem possible, as they have been the 
busiest, and I think the most interest- 
ing ones of my life. I thought there 
would be nothing much to do here and 
perhaps there won't be after we have 
seen it all. We stayed with Estelle a 
week; both she and the baby are well 
and the baby is dear, and not yet can 
we decide whether she is to be named 



Martha or Elizabeth. At the end of 
a week we moved on to our own claim 
and have been living here ever since; 
we think it one of the most perfect 
places to live in we have ever seen, 
although I don't know whether we will 
ever be able to make a living or not, 
on account of the dry weather, but the 
old settlers seem to be able. 

We have had some very thrilling 
experiences already. First we were 
taken all over the valley to look at 
the vacant land, but we couldn't see 

anything we liked, until Mr. M 

brought us up here and we fell in love 
with it at once. Where Estelle lives 
the country is absolutely flat, with 
not a bush nor a tree in sight, but we 
are about four hundred feet higher 
than she is and six miles south, just 
atr the foot of the mountains. Our 
land is a mile and a half long, with 
part of it a quarter of a mile wide and 
part a half-mile wide. The coimtry 
up here is rolling and about one-quarter 
of it is covered with trees which we 
like very much. However, this groimd 
has not been surveyed by the Govern- 
ment yet, so we were not able to file 
on it and hold it. The homestead 
law is that you can file on your claim 
and then you have six months to build 
your house and get ready to live on it. 
Well, as this was not surveyed, the 
only way to hold it is to live on it, 
or "squat", as the term is here. 

Late on Saturday evening, after we 
had decided to take this land, we heard 
that two families had come in that 
afternoon, and were going to move 
on the next morning; so if we wanted 
it we had to move that night, to get 
there first. 

In half an hour we had all our belong- 
ings, with bedclothes, tnmks, cooking 
utensils, grub and two tents ready to 



434 



TWO CITY GIRLS PIONEERING IN ARIZONA 



435 



start. We came up over the prairie 
in the night arriving here about eleven 
p.m., and slept right out under the 
stars. Rosa and I came with our 
brother and his father; of course Estelle 
and baby could not take the trip. It 
surely was great. 

Then, the next morning our neighbors 
came to help us put up the two tents, 
hauled wood for us, and fixed us up 
ready to Uve. The grass was very 
long and just as dry as straw, so, for 
fear we should have a fire the men deci- 
ded they would bum the grass off 
around our tents, but the fire got away 
from them. It burned one of our tents, 
got in our wood pile, and almost burned 
everything we had, but we saved one 
tent and our other things. That fire 
went over the prarie the fastest of any- 
thing you ever saw. I guess it burned 
about eight miles before the people 
in the valley got it conquered. It was 
a bad introduction and we surely were 
frightened, that is, however, all the 
bad luck so far. 

Oiu" tent gone, we have had to Uve 
in a little tent, 8 x 10, where we can 
just stand up in the middle; still we 
surely have been enjoying it. We 
cook above a hole in the ground, with 
a piece of tin over the top, but you 
never tasted anything in Philadelphia 
as good as what we cook on that stove. 
We have the stove, woodpile, water 
barrel and Rosa's trunk on one daim, 
while just over the line we have the 
tent and my trunk, so as to hold down 
both claims. 

Our housekeeping is not strenuous, 
as you may know, but how we do run 
around and enjoy ourselves ! Our claims 
join the State Forest Reserve, on the 
West, so we will never have any neigh- 
bors there; the mountains start there 
and we do have a time exploring. We 
often start just as soon as we have 
had our breakfast, take a lunch along, 
and get back about five or six, ready for 
our supper, I can assure you! We can 
lie down wherever we please, as the 



groimd is perfectly dry. It has rained 
just once since we have been here and 
is not likely to rain again imtil June, 
because this is the dry season. Of 
course, nothing will grow now, but the 
farmers get their ground ready and then 
plant things about Jime, so that things 
are in the groimd when the wet weather 
does come. When the rains begin, it 
rains every day for a month or two and 
things hum then. You see they must 
raise things that will mature quickly 
after that, before the frosts come. 

We are getting our groimd ploughed. 
It is very hard as it has been beaten by 
the rains of centuries. We are also 
getting posts hauled for wire fence, 
and will get a horse as soon as we have 
a place to keep it. We have the lum- 
ber ordered for a house, too, and it 
should come now any day, and then 
it will be more like Uving. for when we 
have our two cots set up in the tent, 
there is only about three feet in which 
to move, but then we have the whole 
of the outside world to stretch in! 

This was once Mexican territory, and 
Mexico gave a strip of land through 
here twenty-five miles long and three 
miles wide to two men for a loan, and 
these men still own this grant. Of 
course, that is not open for homesteading, 
and we are right on the southern edge 
of that grant, and it lies between Estelle 
and us. It also happens that in the 
six miles from her place to ours we do 
not pass a single house. Twice we 
have walked up here at night, in the 
moonlight, and such moonlight you 
never saw as we have here. We never 
encoimter anything worse than wild 
horses and wild cattle. Part of the 
way we have no road, but must go 
only by the stars and mountains, to 
get home. Once we got lost back in 
the moimtains and got separated and 
had a pretty bad scare. I got home 
first, nearly an hour before Rosa, and 
I was nearly frantic. Since that we 
stay together, for I suppose there is 
fifty miles back there of nothing but

moiintains and not a house. 

I haven't told you anything about 
the people, but they are decidedly 
important. Nearly half the claims in 
this valley are taken by immarried 
men. Bachelors on the south and east 
of us and our four nearest neighbors 
are men living alone. Three brothers 
have two claims joining ours and are 
our nearest neighbors; one is about 
twenty-five, and one thirty, and one 
forty, a widower. The one who lives 
alone is away now and we are caring 
for his live stock, which I like very 
much — some chickens, two horses, a 
cat, two kittens and a dog. One dog 
stays over here sometimes. I like the 
kittens best, and one is to be mine as 
soon as it is old enough to leave the 
mother. I have just been over seeing 



to the little turkeys that are hatching, 
about a quarter mile away this place is 
from us. We are going to a settler's 
picnic tomorrow. I am going with the 
boys over the hill and Rosa will come 
back with us for she went down to 
Estelle's and has staid since Monday 
so for three nights I have been alone, 
while the nearest house I can see is 
five miles away. I have not been a bit 
afraid and have had time to write letters. 

I went with Mr. M to haul posts 

yesterday and walked all the way home, 
eight miles, and was not a bit tired. 
Rosa can walk even better than I 
can and she has gladly lost ten pounds! 
And think how she always took the 
car at home! Love for you all. Snap 
shots will follow, so that you can see 
almost with our eyes." 



Tea at the "Blue Ship" 

By Adele Farmer 



GOING to the *Blue Ship' to- 
day?" "Yes?" This from Floss 
as we sat on the deck of the 
"Norman" coming into Boothbay Har- 
bor, one August afternoon the past 
summer. In our many shopping ex- 
peditions to "the harbor" it was a fore- 
gone conclusion that we girls would 
end up at this facinating place. 

Our errands finished, we strolled up 
the main street of the town, until over 
our heads swimg a gray sign, "The 
Blue Ship Gift Shop." We turned our 
backs to the harbor, mounted the high 
steps, flanked on either side by immense 
nasturtiums, and gave a cry of delight 
as we stepped through the door. No 
matter how many times during the 
summer you dropped in for tea, the 
scene was different — new hanging bas- 
kets, a complete change of flowers, or 
still another odd decoration on each 
table. We took possession of one of 
the six square gray tables, and, after 



giving our order to a pretty brown- 
eyed girl with a yellow ribbon around 
her hair, just gazed around us. There 
was one large room and a kitchen, sep- 
arated by a door and gray portidre. 
The walls of the tea room were covered 
with gray burlap stenciled with a bor- 
der of blue ships under full sail. On 
-one side, the unbroken wall space was 
a joy to the eye — beautiful little pic- 
utres in perfectly harmonizing frames, 
odd wall vases wickef and pottery, with 
a spray of red berries, a bimch of Queen 
Anne's lace, a waxy cluster of bayberry 
or a few blades of swamp grass. The 
other side wall had three long shelves, 
painted gray, filled with the most entic- 
ing array of pottery, carved wooden 
bowls and plates, sea-shell china, brass, 
copper and Japanese serving trays. 
Japanese prints, silver ware etc. One 
front window was used as a display 
window, while the other was an ideal 
spot for a table. The counter took up 



TEA AT THE "BLUE SHIP"

part of the back wall with its pile of 
gray paper, box of blue-ship] seals and 
btindles of natural raflfia, to do up the 
dainty purchases. A thick Chinese bowl 
filled with a cliunp of camp green moss 
was used to moisten the seals. The 
floor was stained gray, and several large 
Crex rugs stenciled across each end 
with a border of blue ships were used. 
The windows were curtained with snowy 
white scrim with smaller blue ships 
sailing across the bottom. In the cen- 
ter of the room a large column with a 
seat built aroimd it, piled with gray and 
blue cushions, made a cozy spot. This 
particular day, each table was honored 
with a tiny odd jardiniere in which 
grew a perfect baby fir balsom or spruce 
tree, a large natiu'al color reed, hanging 
basket, with long oddly shaped handles 
up which some brightly colored nas- 
urtiums twisted, was a thing to remem- 
ber. A great brass bowl running over 
with gorgeous goldenrod fairly made 
one comer blaze. A little gray bowl 
filled with a few sprays of cranberries 
just turning red made you want to paint 
it so you could see it always. 



Now to come back from our delight- 
ful survey of the room to the menu 
and our tea. The menu was a heavy 
gray folder with a blue ship at the top 
and 'The Blue Ship, Boothbay Harbor 
Maine'* at the bottom of the front leaf. 
Inside the usual tea room menu was 
printed in blue with a * 'special" for 
every day to be added. Our charm- 
ing waitress brought our ''special'*, del- 
icious clam chowder served in carved 
wooden bowls, on a gray tray with 
a blue ship on it and a cunning 
little yellow chicken salt and pepper 
Then some of us had a "Blue Ship 
Special" sandwich — three layers of 
chopped egg, pickle, nuts and a lettuce 
leaf that was good to the taste. To 
finish off, we had toast, tea and 
gooseberry jam, or a tall glass of milk 
and gingerbread with whipped cream. 
Everything was served on blue dragon 
china, which was lovely with the gen- 
eral surroundings. We lingered over 
oiu" tea cups, until it was absolutely 
necessary to tear ourselves away and 
go on the next pleasure trip home to 
our island bungalow on the "Norman." 



A Happy New Year 



I woke in the morning and thought I was 
friendless, 
So far from my kindred Fate forced me to stay, 
I said, " I am joyless and wretched and lonely, 
Too tearful to sing and too hopeless to pray. 
At home they will miss me, perchance at the 
table, 
And some one may murmur *I wish he were 
here,' 
And then to each other they'll call out their 
greetings 
Good Mornmg, Good Morning, A Happy New 
Year." 



I stood at the noon-tide and thought I was 
beggared 
Of all that makes living a game good to 
play. 
No face of a loved one to smile me a welcome, 
But strangers and aliens each step of the 
way. 
I went to my work like a slave in the galleys, 
I wiped from my eye, half shamefacedly, a 
tear. 
So far were they from me, the comrades, the dear 
ones. 
Who always had bade me A Happy New Year. 



I sat as the shadows of even were falling 

And dreamed of a cottage so far, far away, 
And then in an instant the present grew brighter. 

And all were forgotten, tne griefs of the day. 
I called to the moon beams; I smiled at the 
shadows, 
I whistled a greeting in valley and mere, 
Recalling a maiden, a dear little maiden, 
Who'll breathe, though I come not, A Happy 
New Year.

As to those Five and Ten-Cent Meals 



By Gertrude Clark Hanson . 



I WAS interested, as doubtless many 
other readers were, in the five and 
ten-cent meals described in the No- 
vember issue. In this wasteful and 
luxurious age of ours it is refreshing 
to read such a record of "plain living 
and high thinking." However, I have 
not been able to rid myself of the 
opinion that the experiment, as carried 
out, was not a success from the stand- 
point of nutrition, and that if persisted 
in for any length of time it might be 
a serious menace to health. 

I am by no means an expert in diete- 
tics, but for twelve years I have made 
a study of providing my family with 
the best possible meals at the lowest 
possible cost. In doing this I have 
availed myself of the help offered by 
the best household magazines. It was 
my interest in this question that led 
me to ponder so seriously over the 
article referred to. 

Of course, the writer was greatly 
handicapped by circumstances — lack 
of ice, inability to cook in her room, 
proper appliances, etc. — but even so 
it seems to me that she did not plan 
her meals as well as she might have 
done. For instance, I cannot see the 
advantage in dividing her money arbi- 
trarily as she does — five-cent meals 
one day and ten the next — nor in 
taking all meals at the restaurant one 
day and all in her room the next. 
The restaurant meals were well-chosen, 
but the next day is a dreary succession 
of bakery goods. There are some very 
serious defects here — monotony of the 
three meals per day, lack of variety 
in the meal itself, etc. I understand 
that the sample meal, namely a roll, 
a bun, a cookie, a cruller, a peach and 
a banana, were typical of the home 
meals and that they out-numbered 
the restaurant-meals considerably. She 



seems to realize that these meals lack 
the necessary food elements, but does 
not propose a remedy. Yet this fault, 
if persisted in, will lead to certain 
trouble. 

Taking her plan of five cents a meal 
for one day and ten the next, we find 
that she spends a total of one dollar 
and forty cents the first week and one 
dollar and sixty-five the next week. It 
would be better to take one meal at 
the restatirant every day and two 
five-cent meals in the room. This 
would insure one warm meal a day, 
beside affording a variety not otherwise 
possible. Since she is evidently fond 
of milk and does not object to a little 
sameness, why not make the breakfast 
each day consist of a pint of milk? 
This, with the top cream, would be 
nourishing and would dispose of the 
breakfast problem. This refers only 
to the vacation, as it might not be 
advisable the year round. 

For limcheon, I would suggest that 
she go to the restaurant, being careful 
to select as great a variety, from day 
to day, as is possible with the amount 
expended. This meal should contain 
a vegetable whenever possible, to make 
up for the lack in the other meals. 
The entire cost will be seventy cents 
for the week. 

The second week, according to her 
plan, has a surplus of fifteen cents; 
this might be partly expended the first 
week for the peanut butter, which 
could be stretched out to give variety 
through the two weeks and to help 
supply the fats that are lacking in this 
diet. For supper she must depend 
largely on bakery products as they 
afford the necessary bulk. Two dozen 
rolls, etc., will cost twenty cents, leav- 
ing fifteen cents for fruit; as tomatoes 
are at their best and cheapest in August, 

438 



AS TO THOSE FIVE AND TEN-CENT MEALS 



439 



she might use a part of her fruit allow- 
ance for tomatoes, with profit to herself. 

The same plan, with slight variations, 
will hold good during the working year, 
the straight thirty cents a day giving 
more lee-way. Here one might spend 
five cents for breakfast, fifteen for 
luncheon (restaurant) and ten for sup- 
per; or the amount set aside for supper 
and breakfast could be divided as cir- 
cumstances demanded. There are in 
most of our cities restaurants in con- 
nection with the Yotmg Women's Chris- 
tian Associations; they are in no 
sense charitable institutions and any 
girl can patronize them without loss 
of self-respect, as she pays a fair price 
for what she gets. The food is almost 
certain to be clean and * wholesome. 
Many of these restaurants are on the 
three-cent basis — three cents for each 
item, bread, vegetable, meat, dessert, 
etc. One can readily see the possibi- 
lities here. And even on the five-cent 
basis fifteeen cnts will get a wholesome 
luncheon, with occasional dessert, which 
everybody craves. This need for sweet 
things explains the milk chocolate in 
the menu given. 

It is very doubtful whether, even 
with the hot meal at noon, the cold 
breakfast and supper are wise as a 
steady proposition. A bottle of milk 
is cold comfort when it precedes a 
long, cold trip to work, and at the 
end of a hard day, it is not cheering to 
sit down to baker's rolls and fruit. 
All landladies object, very naturally, 
to the use of their hard-earned gas for 
cooking purposes and to the odor of 
burned grease in the upper halls; but 
I believe one could be found who would 
readily permit the judicious use of 
a spirit lamp. To the girl who is on 
a narrow margin this may seem an 
impossible extravagance, but it will 
prove an economy in the long run. 
The cost of operation will be slight, as 
it need not be used for cooking, but 
only in re-heating food. There will 
be fewer fifteen-cent restaurant meals 



when once the possibilities of a can- 
opener and a lamp are realized. In 
cool weather the pint of milk may be 
divided and a half kept for supper or 
even for the next morning, while the 
other half, after heating, did duty on 
a shredded wheat biscuit. The latter 
at fifteen cents a dozen will go far in 
furnishing warm nourishing breakfasts. 
So, also, will graham crackers at ten 
cents a box. 

For supper there are the canned 
soups, which come in great variety 
and excellent quality at ten cents per 
can, and need only diluting and heating. 
A can is supposed to serve six plates, 
but I figure that a hungry girl will 
make only two or three meals of it 
with rolls and fruit. The left-over 
portion should, of course, be emptied 
at once into a bowl and kept in a cool 
place; this rule holds good with all 
canned foods. Then there is the ever 
popular can of baked beans at ten cents 
and the prepared spaghetti that con- 
tains most of the elements of a complete 
meal. In many places a fine quality 
of butter can be bought in quarter- 
pound cartons; it can be judiciously 
used for creamed, dried beef or salmon 
or on the rolls, occasionally. A girl 
who is at all handy will be able to fix 
up a tiny window-box that will keep 
food fresh in all but summer weather. 
When the days grow warm and there 
is not so much need of hot food, she 
will be able to buy in tiny quantities 
at the delicatessen stores foods which 
will be within her reach and yet nourish- 
ing. And as one goes on experimenting 
she will find great possibilities for im- 
proving her diet. 

When a girl can find another who 
shares her ideals, the question of ex- 
pense as well as company is greatly 
simplified. To me this seems the more 
normal way to live. But if she chooses 
to work out her problems alone, she 
can do so satisfactorily. It does not 
seem wise to make Sunday a day of 
extra saving; it ought to be a day looked

forward to for some special treat. 

I have gone into this subject at length, 
because it seems to be such a vital one. 
One of the best assets a self-supporting 
girl can have is an abounding physical 
life, and this can be maintained only 



by sufficient food, properly chosen. 
I am sure that any dietitian will agree 
with me that the program laid down 
in the November issue will, if carried 
out for any length of time, result in 
disaster. 



Linens for the Fair Bride 



By Janet Young Norton 



THERE is perhaps no possession 
dearer to the heart of the 
bride of to-day than her well- 
filled linen chest. Never were the 
linens for household use as beautiful 
in texture or as varied in patterns as 
they are at the present time. The 
choice of patterns in our grandmother's 
day was rather limited as to variety, 
and every bride, after selecting the 
best, always added a **rain drop'* 
cloth with a Grecian key border as 
the ''company cloth" to her purchases. 
The bride of to-day also adds the 
favorite old pattern to her chest, but 
the design now boasts several sized 
dots and a number of attractive borders. 

The vogue of the round table brought 
round cloths into use, but they proved 
a difficult problem as to laundering 
and did not become popular. Now 
square tables are coming into their 
own again, on account of their more 
convenient size for decorating, and 
the square cloths are more beautiful 
than ever. 

The leader is the cloth of plain heavy 
damask with the satin border stripe, 
for it shows the centrepiece off to 
advantage when one is used, where 
the more complicated patterns take 
from its beauty. 

Among the small patterned cloths 
there is the old rain spot, and wafer- 
sized spots run between the stripes 
to form the border, the Flax flower 
and Shamrock, Iris flower and foliage 



and a number of other attractive 
patterns. The broad diagonal stripes 
that stretch from corner to comer 
of the square table and the straight 
stripes that run its length are all 
popular and show the Grecian key 
and other borders. 

The Vatican scroll, Woodbine scroll. 
Game birds, Aquatic birds and water 
lillies are the good patterns in the 
larger designs. 

Next in consideration are the hand- 
embroidered on fine damask, these 
cloths have the scalloped edges with 
the design covering the center of the 
table top. Some also have lace medal- 
lions, insertions and edges; the more 
elaborate they are the more expensive 
they become, and they are not as 
durable as the regular patterned cloths. 
The Cluny lace still holds first place 
with the Filet laces a close second, 
and in all cases the serviettes come 
to match. 

The Madeira embroidery is more 
beautiful than ever and is most popular 
for centerpieces and doylies, also for 
luncheon cloths and tray cloths. No 
wedding chest is complete without 
some of the pretty luncheon squares 
and linen sets. There are some in 
the natural linen, hemstitched and em- 
broidered in natural colors, some in 
white art linen, embroidered in the 
Dresden blues copying the dish pat- 
terns and borders. 

Rather a new idea is to buy the blue 



LINENS FOR THE FAIR BRIDE 



441 



and white Japanese toweling and fag- 
got stitch the narrow stripes together 
with blue cotton, finishing the ends 
that hang over in deep points with 
feather-stitched hems, and the ser- 
viettes to match are also feather- 
stitched. These are very pretty to 
use with the blue Japanese china and 
are very easily made. They also make 
fresh looking breakfast tray cloths. 

Of course, centerpieces are in vogue 
still, but there are so many floral 
decorations, table bows and fancy cen- 
ter china decorations that are new 
that they are not as often seen as 
formerly. The reason for this may 
also be attributed to the lace medal- 
lion cloths which, of course extra cen- 
terpieces cannot be used with, as they 
are sufficient in themselves. The mono- 
grams are used a great deal in all 
sizes according to personal taste, but 
the formal cloths show them at the 
comers or at the ends in the large 
sizes, some in the flat work and some 
in the filled work. 

Quite as elaborate as the table 
linens are the bed linens and the one 
time plain deep hemmed sheet looks 
quite modest and old-fashioned beside 
the hemstitched hems and the lace 
insertioned hems, the elaborately em- 
broidered top sheets in Louis 16th 
baskets, bow knots and roses, and the 
ribbon-run borders of the most dressy 
ones. Then the spreads are a joy to 
behold, the dimities, the hand-drawn 
canvas spreads, the hand embroidered 
muslin spreads, the cluny and filet 
lace affairs to be tied with huge satin 
bows at the brass bedposts, with the 
bolster rolls to match are a few that 
are offered the bride for approval. 
Some people who are making their 
pillow cases are using the Bohemian 
Idea of making the closed end with 
a four inch insertion of lace on either 
side to show the colored case beneath, 
and the hem end then is hemstitched 
and initialed. Towels are in all sizes 
and weaves and are coming in for their 



share of embroidering, and lace ends, 
even the common sense bath towels 
cannot escape the modem needle wom- 
an's eiiergetic enthusiasm. 

In the kitchen towels the fad is 
more pronounced than ever to have 
towels in different patterns and colors 
to use for different purposes, which 
a small memorandum book sets forth 
for a continual reminder to the maids 
who care for them. Hence the big 
blue solid checks are dubbed * 'Scul- 
lery," the small blue blocks are * 'kit- 
chen dish wipers," the fine line blue 
blocks are "glass and silver" towels, 
while the- red fine lines are ''general 
dish towels." Then there are coarse 
and fine dish cloths with loops on 
to hang them by, the cut glass cloths 
and towels that must never come 
in contact with the slightest grease 
are quite formidable in variety. The 
kitchen roller of other days is added 
to the collection, but in many of the 
kitchens now the paper towel rolls 
are thought more sanitary. Then there 
is the array of refrigerator linen bags, 
fish rollers, celery rollers, binders for 
boiling vegetables or certain meats 
in, spice bags, cheese bags and cheese 
cloth squares for handling cooked foods 
and to bale platters, when the meats 
weep their juices too freely, before 
serving. 

All these linen accessories have to 
be thought of for the bride's new kit- 
chen, though they are not strictly 
speaking occupants of the linen chest. 
Blanket bags of coarse white linen 
are made boxed so that they hold one 
pair of double blankets after they have 
been cleaned or laundered to pack 
away for the summer, each having 
the lettered information on them as 
to which bed the contents belong. 

In a pocket in the lid of the latest 
linen chest there is an embroidered 
linen envelope which holds a linen 
bound book containing important in- 
formation for the caring of fine linens, 
proper folding of them, recipes for 



442 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



taking out spots of all kinds, proper 
darning and mending instructions, right 
way to launder them, and the correct 
way to make up laundry and closet 
lists. This is quite valuable especially 
for the young housekeeper, as dire 
consternation seizes her when an acci- 
dent happens in the way of the over- 
turned Claret glass or the spilling of 
small fruits that are sure to leave a 
stain. Just a few * 'first aid'* remedies 
are copied here for the benefit of those 
who may not be able to procure the 
little book, and they are the most 
reUable ones known. 

"Ink spots are removed from Unen 
by dipping the part into hot water 
then spreading it smoothly on the 
back of the spoon or on the hand, 
and pouring a few drops of Oxalic 
acid or '.salts of Sorrel over the spot, 
thoroughly rinsing and rubbing in cold 
water until removed. This must be 
done before it is put into the regular 
wash." 



** Grease spots are removed by rub- 
bing over with yellow soap and rins- 
ing in hot water.*' 

"Fruit and wine spots may be re- 
moved by dipping in a solution of Sal 
Ammonia or spirits of wine and rins- 
ing in cool water. Coflfee and tea 
stains are easily . removed with boil- 
ing water, while iron rust will usually 
remove readily with the application 
of salts of lemon." 

These recipes will also remove all 
stains from the silence cloths, which 
are not washed as often as the table 
linen, and the spots standing grow 
black and ugly if not looked after 
promptly. 

It is also advisable, if laundered linen 
for special occasions is not used often, 
to wrap it in a deeply blued cloth, 
to keep it from turning yellow. The 
centerpiece rolls and the tablecloth 
rolls are better than folding, if one 
has the room to keep them in that, 
way. 



Watch Your Step! 

By Grace Barton Allen Cook 



A CELEBRATED mustard man- 
ufacturer once said, that it 
was not the mustard that 
was eaten which paid a profit, but 
that which was left on the plate. He 
particularized a great general truth. 
It is the waste that costs, in other 
things as in mustard. Waste of money 
costs the deprivation of what is really 
needed; waste of time costs the sacri- 
fice of necessary duty, or rest, or recrea- 
tion; waste of energy costs strength, 
spirits and vitality. There is probably 
nowhere that the latter waste goes 
on so tmceasingly and insidiously as 
in housekeeping, especially in homes 
where the income is so modest that 
most or all of the work is done by 
the housemother, whose vital powers 



are continually "on tap," and being 
drawn upon in the service of the other 
members of the family. What with 
the duties legitimately hers, and those 
imposed upon her by the thoughtless- 
ness of persons about her, she comes 
as near solving the problem of per- 
petual motion as any hxmian being 
is ever likely to do. "Mind your 
step," tired little lady! Don't take 
so many unnecessarily, or you will 
cease taking any at all, long before 
you ought. 

You will say, perhaps, that all this 
going to and fro is part of the day's 
work, and therefore unavoidable; but 
is all of it absolutely essential? Will 
not some of it prove, on examination, 
to be "waste motion," consequent on 



WATCH YOUR STEP! 



443 



defective equipment, or poor adjust- 
ment, or lack of consecutive planning? 
Few women live in a house which 
they have designed themselves, in ac- 
cordance with their special needs; and 
it is a question of adaptation, which 
may be more or less successful, accord- 
ing to the thought given to overcoming 
faults of existing arrangements. 

Of all such existing arrangements, 
long halls and large kitchens are most 
useless consumers of energy, multi- 
plying steps and holding apart the 
foci of operations instead of keeping 
them concentrated. Concentration — 
that is the secret of efficiency. Plan 
any piece of work so that you need 
take but three steps where formerly 
you took a dozen, and just so much 
energy is saved toward performing 
the next task. 

This is a day of labor-saving devices, 
and women who cannot afford to 
fit up their homes with such are apt 
to think that, if they could, the domes- 
tic problem would be solved. But not 
all labor-saving inventions are worthy 
the name, and of those that are, many 
increase labor in one direction while 
they save it in another, and are use- 
ful only where there is a large family, 
or servants are kept. Even in the 
case of those which are practical for 
small families, the possession of too 
many is apt to clog progress rather 
than help it, where the mistress of 
the house is also the maid-of-all-work. 
Every such contrivance, in order to 
be efficient, must be kept clean and 
in order, and in an easily accessible 
place: and the care and bestowing of 
such things is no light item in the 
week's labor of one pair of hands. 
Let the housekeeper consider which 
of her household tasks bear most 
heavily upon her, and if she can afford 
any machine which will shorten and 
lighten those particular duties, it will 
be a wise investment. But any one 
person who should attempt to take 
care of and operate a special labor- 



saving device for every item of house- 
hold labor, would probably die of 
overwork within a month. 

Consider, first, the equipment you 
already have, and see if you cannot 
arrange it to better advantage. "Watch 
your step!" Have a table near the 
stove, so that you need not walk the 
length of the kitchen to set down your 
cookery; and a piece of zinc, nailed 
over the table top by your own hands, 
will free your mind of any hesitation 
because of the heat or blackness of 
the saucepan — merely wiping with a 
wet cloth will clean the zinc, which 
cannot burn and does not need scour- 
ing. Have another table, or a shelf, 
just inside the kitchen door which 
leads to the dining-room, so that 
in clearing the table after a meal 
there will be only a short distance 
to carry the soiled tableware. Don't 
think that your entire dinner-set must 
be together in the dining-room china 
closet. Keep the meat platters and 
vegetable dishes within easy reach 
in the kitchen cupboard, instead of 
where you must take a long trip after 
them when preparing dinner. Remem- 
ber that, where so much has to be 
done, every avoidable instance of walk- 
ing and standing, stooping, straining 
and reaching, is so much dead loss 
of energy — so much uselessly sub- 
tracted from your bodily capital. 

If you have no kitchen cabinet, 
have a common deal table, with drawers, 
for cooking, and have the drawers 
divided, by strips of wood nailed in 
lengthwise, into compartments to hold 
knives, forks, spoons, egg-beater, nut- 
meg grater and other such kitchen 
hardware, which may thus be kept 
under your hand without confusion. 
Put up a narrow shelf behind the 
stove, not too high, and keep there 
the matches, sugar, salt and flour 
dredger, and holders for handling hot 
things, so they will be always at the 
spot where they are needed. Even 
if you don't believe in a long-handled 



444 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



mop for washing the floor, have one 
for wiping up accidental splashes — 
it will save your back. Hang up the 
dish towels within reach of the sink 
instead of on the other side of the room. 

Don't do any kind of work in a hard 
way just because your mother and 
grandmother did it so. Recollect, when 
you hear about the wonderful amoimt 
of work they did, that you do a great 
many things they were not expected 
to do, and are living up to quite a 
different standard from that prevail- 
ing fifty years ago. Probably your 
grandmother would have thought it 
little short of a sin not to stand up 
while ironing; but you will find that, 
by resting upon a tall office stool while 
thus occupied, your feet will be saved 
a great deal of discomfort. Keep a 
light stool of ordinary height under 
the kitchen sink, to sit on while you 
wash dishes. If there is a table or 
shelf at each end of the sink, you can 
easily wash and wipe dishes while 
seated. One or the other of these 
stools will be the right height to sit 
on when cooking those things which 
require to be ** stirred constantly'* while 
they are on the stove. 

Trifles make an appreciable differ- 
ence in the ease of carrying on the 
day's work. There is no economy of 
money, and a great waste of time 
and nervous irritation, when the fit- 
tings of the house are allowed to remain 
out of repair. Before buying new con- 
veniences, see that those you have 
are in good working order. Replace 
that broken spring on the screen door, 
so that it will close itself instead of 
having to be pulled shut every time 
you pass through. Other people are 
not so careful — they leave it open, 
and then you are the one who has to 
fight the battle with flies. Have a 
carpenter loosen that window which 
you can never open without a prolonged 
struggle. If there is a door which 
ought to stay open and won't, put a 
little hasp on the baseboard behind 



it and a screweye on the door itself 
near the bottom and hook it back, 
so you will not be obliged to run and 
open it every time the wind blows. Do 
not wear old shoes with imeven heels 
while you are working; not beacuse 
of their appearance, although that is 
unsightly, but because the crooked 
heels aUow the foot to slip sidewise 
in the shoe so that the weight of the 
body is not properly supported, and 
the fatigue of standing and walking 
is doubled. 

Watch your steps going up and 
down the stairs. Save some of them by 
having another broom, brush, dust- 
pan and carpet-sweeper, and keeping 
them on the second floor. This will 
not cost double, because where there 
are too sets, each gets but half the wear, 
and so lasts twice as long. Establish 
up there a box holding a tack hanmier, 
a few nails, a gimlet and a ball of 
twine; it will save many a trip to the 
kitchen. Needles, thread, thimble and 
scissors on each floor are another cost- 
less convenience, while a scrap basket for 
every room economizes innumerable 
steps. 

Things which belong upstairs are 
continually being left downstairs, and 
vice versa. Have a stand or shelf 
at the foot of the staircase for the 
avowed purpose of serving as a station 
for the things that should go up, and 
place them there as you come across 
them during your work, with the 
general understanding that whoever 
makes the journey shall carry some- 
thing. A similar station at the top 
of the stairs shotdd receive articles 
to be taken down. It also saves ntiuch 
special stair-climbing to keep a small 
supply of clean collars and kandker- 
chiefs on the lower floor, to be drawn 
upon in emergencies; and by all means 
have a clock, no matter how cheap, 
in every room, so that you can see 
what time it is without rising from 
your chair. 

A disorderly family is the most 



WATCH YOUR STEP!

reckless squanderer of the house-mother's 
energy. For each person to pick up 
after himself is not much; but for 
one person, already carrying the bur- 
den of regular work, to pick up after 
all the rest, is an unrighteous tax 
which should never be exacted or 
paid. Watch your step. Teach the 
children that they must not throw 
down their books and toys and clothes 
for you to gather up and put away. 
The lesson will benefit them as much 
as it will you. The time is surely 
coming when they will not have you 
to bring order out of their chaos; 
and if they have not learned to take 
care of their possessions, wherever they 
go they will be an inconvenience to 
themselves and an irritation to other 
people. 

If the head of the family has been 
reared by an injudicious mother and 
has grown to manhood in the habit 
of being waited upon in this way, 
it is probably useless to attempt to 
change what has grown into a com- 
fortable second nature. It is always 
worth while to make the effort in the 
first place, but never worth while to 
keep it up after experience has proved 
that it is of no effect. There was 
once a woman who tried for forty 
years to break her husband of the 
habit of leaving his muddy boots 
in the dining-room. At the begin- 
ning of the forty-first year the boots 
were still there for her to pick up and 
put away. She might have known 
at the end of twelve months that 
reformation was hopeless, and so saved 
thirty-nine years of controversy. Give 
up the struggle, not because this fixed 
habit of selfish disorder is just or right, 
or "one to which it is your duty to 



yield, but because you will have to 
endure it anyway, and it is expedient 
to do so amiably. The only recourse 
in such a case is to establish some 
system for yourself which shall make 
the rectifying of the disorder as easy 
as possible. If you cannot keep shoes 
and rubbers out of the living-room, 
have a box there covered with cretonne 
or carpet, with a hinged lid, to hide 
them in. Give up a small drawer 
in the sideboard or table for stray 
collars, handkerchiefs and gloves. Put 
up a high shelf in the hall for the hats, 
and always put them in that one place 
when you collect them from the chairs 
and couch, so that you will not be 
obliged to rim all over the house to 
help find them. One of the hardest 
lessons a wife and mother has to learn 
is, not to kick against the pricks when 
she finds that they cannot be kicked 
out of existence, but are permanent 
fixtures. Accept them — but pad them 
as much as you can. 

Watch your step. Spare yourself, 
not by sacrificing your housekeeping 
ideals, but by simplifying them and 
making it easy to do your work well. 
It is not laziness to achieve the greatest 
result with the least expenditure of 
energy; it is what political economists 
call conservation of natural resources. 
Your time and strength and service 
are a large part of the wealth of the 
family, and should be administered 
as carefully as any of its other fimds. 
Do not think, because they cost no 
money, they have no intrinsic value, 
and are to be lavished without thought 
of possible bankruptcy. Be a little 
good to yourself, and you will have 
a longer time to be good to those you 
love.

THE VIGIL-KEEPERS 

Across the city heights 

The winds have murmured peace; 
In windows friendly lights 

From glowing cease. 

Yet I turn not to rest 

In deep, calm arms of sleep; 
Till night fades in the west, 

Long vigil must I keep. 

He sleeps so quietly, 

The great night broods around, 
A fear steals over me — 

A loneliness profound. 

But shining, here and there, 

Like golden, drowsy flow'rs, 
Soft lights show that hearts share 

With me the midnight hours. 

I know that faithful near 

And far beyond my sight, 
Hearts keep o'er some one dear 

Love watches of the night.

HAPPY NEW YEAR 

Christmas giving for 1913 is now past; 
New Year Congrattilations are being 
spoken and new resolutions, made for 
1914. Among the latter we hope you 
have resolved to continue your sub- 
scription to the Cooking-School Maga- 
zine. The prospects of presenting to 
our readers, in the present year, new and 
interesting features are promising, indeed. 
Some of our plans may prove a pleas- 
ing surprise to all. Nothing is too 
good for the woman who would look 
well to the ways of her household. 

CHEERFUL HOMES 

PLAIN housekeeping, with stand- 
ard goods in everything, is the 
maxim by which this publication is 
guided. On our advertising pages we 
present the best brands of flour, the best 
groceries and the best household utensils 
and appliances to be found in the mar- 
ket. All these items are first-class and 
especially adapted to the needs of 
housekeepers. In selecting and pur- 
chasing from these goods no one can 
make a mistake or go wrong. And 
where health and comfort are concerned 
it pays to buy the best of everything. 

While other periodicals, with scarcely 
an exception, have added at least one 
half to the price of subscription, for one 
dollar we are trying constantly to im- 
prove the character and quality of our 
ocntents. And as a dollar publication 
we are now aware of no successful com- 
petitor. 

A woman, who was asked recently 
why she liked the Cooking-School Mag- 
azine, replied :** Because it helps me make 
the most of everything." How to make 
a business or an occupation successfttl 
or paying is a condition every one must 
face. However, to be well informed 
and equipped in our special line is very 
important. Our main ambition is to 
help the housekeeper in making the 
most of everything. To aid even a 
little in the realization of healthful,

cheerful homes is, we think, an object 
worth striving for. 

OPINIONS CHANGE 

OPINIONS change! The fact has 
never been so clearly shown as 
during the recent discussions about 
the probabilities of war and the pos- 
sibilities of disarmament. Five years 
ago Englishmen believed that the for- 
eigner — that is, the German — wanted 
English trade, wealth and colonies, 
and would take them tuiless England 
defended them by her arms; now all 
educated men realize that nations do 
not go to war for these things, and that 
trade and wealth cannot be "taken." 
Some time ago, we were told that man 
was a fighting animal and wanted an 
outlet for his passions; to-day, among 
the great mass of population in France 
and Germany, one finds either indif- 
ference or nausea with regard to an 
international conflict and a clearly in- 
dicated determination not to be drag- 
ged into it. A few years ago it was 
thought that German newspapers in- 
dicated the temper of the people when 
they advocated a larger navy; now we 
know that Admiral Tirpitz had the 
Knipps buy a newspaper or two, and 
that the German public was not con- 
cerned in the matter. Twenty years 
ago Englishmen boasted of the Crimean 
War; now no one attempts to defend it. 
Ten years ago Englishmen boasted of 
their victories in South Africa; now 
they own they were scarcely justifiable. 
A few years ago we believed England 
was satisfied to expend millions for 
dreadnoughts; this year we find the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer sajdng 
that "he is genuinely alarmed about 
the expenditure on armaments"; that 
*' it can only end in terrible disaster," 
and that " few people realize how near 
England has been to that disaster during 
the last twelve months." Eighteen 
months ago Sir Edward Grey said: "It 
is an axiom that whenever a war breaks 
out in the Balkans, it will be impossible 



to prevent one or more of the Great 
Powers being drawn into the war;*' 
a couple of months after the war broke 
out, Mr. Bonar Law affirmed that the 
danger of a European war was gone, 
and the London Times remarked, " Who 
would have dared twelve months ago to 
foretell that a great and prolonged 
struggle could be fought out in the 
Balkans without causing such a war? " 
The times change and men change with 
them. In this way progress is made. 

DOMESTIC SCIENCE, 
EAST AND WEST 

IT would seem that the people of our 
western borders are more interested 
in domestic science than are they, for 
instance, of so-called cultivated New 
England. The courses of instruction 
in western schools and colleges are 
thought to be more practical in char- 
acter. How to earn a living seems to be 
the item of foremost concern. Hence 
preparation for some real life work in- 
spires the work done in our western 
institutions. Industrial training of all 
kinds is becoming most popular. In 
many a school of the west a fiilly equip- 
ped department for teaching domestic 
science has been provided for. This 
equipment includes a class-room and 
laboratory, a kitchen, laimdry, dining- 
room, reception room, bedroom and bath 
— all furnished with the best of modem 
appliances and accessories. Thus the 
proper apparatus and means are at 
hand to impart practical instruction 
in scientific housekeeping. 

This rapid increase of industrial train- 
ing is one of the most remarkable sign 
of the times; for not only in western 
institutions activity and development 
along this line are indicated, but also, 
in the courses of study in household 
arts now given at Pratt Institute, Teach- 
ers College and Simmons College, grow- 
ing interest in the subject is equally 
marked. 

All this means a good deal. House- 
keeping has become a business, a call-

ing, in the pursuit of which intelligence 
and training are called for. Education, 
in the future, will be less theoretical 
and more practical. It will consist in 
cultivating the natural activities of the 
htiman being in ways that lead to nat- 
ural, wholesome and noble living. 

AS OTHERS SEE US 

EAT hearty, drink hearty, work 
hearty" sums up in brief the 
food philosophy of Dr Woods 
Hutchinson, as expounded in an article 
in Nash's Magazine. It is a jolly 
Rabelaisian maxim of very seasonable 
application. Dr. Woods Hutchinson is 
the implacable enemy of faddism in 
all the affairs of life especially of the 
faddism that concerns itself with what 
we eat and drink. He is of that school 
of philosophers who hold with us that 
the prolonged existence of any generally 
pronounced preference is fairly good 
evidence that the thing preferred is 
the right thing, while he points out 
that the underlying principle of all so- 
called food reform is to find out what 
people like to eat and then tell them 
that they must not take it on peril of 
their lives. 

White bread, he dares to say, is 
good food; people always have preferred 
it and always will prefer it, while as 
to meat, after all the claims of all the 
other proteins have been thrashed out 
and considered and all the alleged calami- 
ties and diseases said to follow in the 
train of meat-eating have gone up in 
smoke, we are drawn to the conclusion 
that as a practical, constant, everyday, 
all the year round source of protein for 
adults there is nothing like meat. 

Here then are his conclusions upon 
the diet theory. "The new diet theory 
is based upon the idea of progress, of 
continuous improvement, of never rest- 
ing satisfied with things as they are. 
It is not in the least concerned with 
the question of upon how small pro- 
portions of either protein, or sugar or 
fat, or upon how small quantities of 



actual food the body may be maintained 
in a state of balance and moderate 
health. Its problem, on the contrary, 
is testing how large amoimts of varied 
nutritious foods the body can consume 
and turn to good account, in increase 
of working power and of resistance 
against disease. No diet is too liberal 
or too expensive which will, so to speak, 
yield good returns on the investment, 
pay commercial interest on the food 
cost, however great. It looks upon 
the human machine, whether our own 
or that of our fellows, or our employees, 
as the modern scientific farmer looks 
upon his soil, as a field for investment, 
upon which is to be spent as much 
capital and labour as will yield a pro- 
fitable return." — Exchange, 



At Home 



Bessie and Bertie were at a loss for 
a game to play. 

"Oh, let's play being *at home* and 
have 'a day,' " suggested Bessie. 

" 'A day ?' " queried Bertie. "What 
does that mean.'^" 

"Why, don't you know?" said Bessie, 
wisely. * * All the fashionable people have 
'days.' God's day is Sunday, and 
mother's is Tuesday." 



TRANSFORMATION 

The winter world is drear, love. 
The snow-kissed winds are chill; 

There's no bird on the bou^h, love, 
And no flower on the hilf 

The skies are bleak and grey, love, 

The river's heart is dead; 
The forest ways are dim, love, 

For the sun-lit hours have sped. 

Ah, but the fire's within, love, 
Though the roadway frozen lies; 

Upon your cheek the roses bloom, 
And violets in your eyes. 

Your laughter is the birdsong, love, 
That greets the breaking day; 

When you and I go hand in hand, 
December's changed to May.

Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 



IN all recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after 
sifting once. Where flour is measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a 
level cupful is meant A tablespoonful or teaspoonful of any designated material is a 
LEVKL spoonful. 



Puree of Carrots 

SCRAPE two large carrots, wash 
and dry, then cut in shoes or 
shreds the outer red part of 
the carrots and discard the centers. 
Put into a saucepan with two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, a pint of boihng 
water, a teaspoonful of sugar and a 
dash of paprika; cover and let simmer 
very gently about an hour; add three 
cups (well pressed down) of white 
bread, soaked in cold water and pressed 
dry in a cloth, and two quarts of chicken 
or veal broth, let simmer an hour, 
then press through a sieve; return to 
the fire to become hot without boiling; 
add more broth if needed, also salt 



and pepper, and beat in two table- 
spoonfuls of butter in little bits. Serve 
with croutons. 

Chicken Samboyon (Soup) 

Remove the fat from strong chicken 
broth, and put a quart of the broth in a 
double-boiler with a teaspoonful of salt 
and from one-fourth to one-half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper. Beat the yolks of 
eight eggs; dilute with a little cold broth, 
mix and add a little hot broth; mix 
again, then stir into the hot liquid; 
continue to stir until the mixture 
thickens. Serve at once in bouillon 
cups, with toasted crackers. This may 
be made with less yolks. It is most 
frequently served when a large quantity

meat course. 



OVSTEBS. LANSDALE 

Oysters, Lansdale {The Caterer) 
Select a large firm mushroom, peel 
and trim, leaving the stalk intact. 
Cook in clarified butter with the stem 
up. Put fresh-opened oysters into the 
same butter and let saut^ until the 
edges ciarl on one side; turn and saut6 
a moment on the other side. While 
the mushroom and oysters are cook- 
ing, broil a thick slice of tomato, set 
the tomato on an egg shirring dish, 
sprinkle it with salt and pepper and 
drop on several bits of butter. Set 
the mushroom, stalk upwards, on the 
tomato and dispose the oysters on 
the mushroom around the stem. Sea- 



son to taste. Cover with a glass 
bell. The shirrer and bell should both 
'be well heated. Serve at once. 

Finnan Haddie, Dinner Style 

' ■ Put the thick half of a finnan haddie 
over the fire in cold water and let 
heat slowly to the boiling point; draw 
to a cooler part of the range and let 
stand half an hour; the water should 
not boil during this time. Remove 
the fish from the water and take out 
the bone. Set the fish in a narrow 
earthen dish suitable for the oven 
and the table. While the fish is over 
the fire, make ready six or eight potatoes 
of the same size; steam or boil these, 
sprinkle with salt and let dry off, 
then set them in the dish aroimd 
the fish, as a border; pour in a cup 
of cream, fleck the potatoes with paprika 
and dot the fish with a few bits of 
butter. Place the dish in a moderate 
oven. Serve in five or six minutes. 

Boiled Fresh Fish, with Oysters 
Have a fresh fish carefully cleaned. 
Do not retain head or tail. Set on 
a fish sheet or a piece of buttered tin 
in a receptacle of sufficient length 
to have the fish lie fiat; pom- in a pint, 
each, of lukewarm broth (white) and 
water, a teaspoonful of salt and the 
juice of half a lemon; cover and let

Oyster Omelet 

Pour one-third a cup of cold water 
over half a pint of oysters, and examine 
them, one by one, to remove bits of 
shell if present; strain the water through 
cheese cloth, heat to the boiling point, 
add the oysters and heat the whole 
to the boiling point. Drain off the 
liqtiid and keep the oysters hot. Melt 
two tablespoonfuls of butter; in it 
cook two tablespoonfuls and a half 
of Sour, and one-fourth a teaspoonful, 
each, of salt and paprika; stir until 
boiling, then add the oyster liquor 
with cream to make one cup in all; 
add the oysters and set over hot water. 
Beat the yolks of four eggs until light, 
also beat the whites dry. To the yolks 
add four tablespoonfuls of the sauce 



mix and turn over the whites; fold 
the two mixtures together. Have ready 
a tablespoonful of butter melted in 
a hot omelet pan; turn the pan to 
butter it evenly, then pour in the 
egg-mixture; let stand a moment 
to set the egg on the bottom, then 
move to the oven — which should not 
be very hot. When a knife cut down 
into the omelet comes out without 
uncooked egg upon it, score the ome- 
let at right angles to the handle of 
the pan; set a few oysters with sauce 
on one half, fold the other half over 
and turn on to a hot dish; pour the 
rest of the oysters and the sauce around 
the omelet and serve at once. 

Deerfoot Sausage, Burbank (The 
Caterer) 



VENISON. WITH SPROUTS AND CHESTNUT PUH^E 



SEASONABLE RECIPES 



Select rather large potatoes of uni- 
form size ; pare and with an apple corer 
cut an opening through them, length- 
wise of the potato. With a fork. 
prick as many small Deerfoot sausage 
as there are potatoes; pour boiling 
water over them, let simmer six of 
eight minutes, then drain and dis- 
pose them in the potatoes, one in each. 
Let the potatoes bake until done. 
Serve at once, with strips of broiled 
bacon and fried onions as a luncheon 
dish. 

Pot Roast of Beef 
Four or five pounds of beef, in a 
thick piece, from the chuck, the vein 
or the round should be selected for 
this dish. Many prefer meat from 
the vein or round as it is sohd flesh, 
but a piece from the chuck, as fat 
alternates with lean meat, will be 
quite as satisfactory. Roll the meat 
on three sides in flour. Have ready 
some hot fat in a frying pan; this 
may be fat from suet marrow, or salt 
pork or the top of a saucepan of soup. 
Brown the meat in the fat on one side, 
then turn and brown the other sides, 
one after another. An onion cut in 
rings may be cooked in the fat until 
yellowed and removed before the meat 
is set to brown. When the meat is 
well browned, set it into an iron or 
some other heavy saucepan; add about 
one cup of boiling water and let cook 



CERMAINE SALAD 



about six hours at a gentle simmer; 
add boiling water as needed and turn 
the meat occasionally. When the meat 
is tender, remove to a serving dish 
and thicken the liquid with two table- 
spoonfuls of flour smoothed in a little 
cold water. Season the sauce with 
salt and pepper. Serve, at the same 
time potatoes and any of the winter 
vegetables. 

Venison, with Sprouts and Chest- 
nut Puree 
Have ready some rounds of venison 
about an inch thick, cut from the 
fillet under the rump and broiled as 
any steak; also pipe some chest- 
nut purfe on a serving dish, set the 
venison above and the sprouts at 
the ends of the dish. Pour Madeira 
sauce with slices of venison or beef 
marrow over the meat, or serve celery 
with Madeira sauce and marrow at 
the same time. 



BRUSSELS SPROUTS, WITH TOAST POINTS 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



Puree of Chestnuts 

Cut a half-inch slit in one side of 
the chestnut shells; let cook in boil- 
ing water two minutes, drain and 
dry. To each pint of nuts add a 
teaspoonful of butter or oil and stir 
and shake in the oven three or four 
minutes; then inserting the point of 
a knife in the slit made in the shell 
before cooking, remove shell and skin 
together. Keep the nuts covered while 
shelling is in process — to accelerate 
the work. Stew the shelled and blanched 
nuts very gently in consomm^ until 
tender. Press the nuts through a ricer 
or sieve, add cream, salt, pepper and 
butter, beat thoroughly, over the fire, 
then pipe, as above, on a hot plate. 



to a hot dish, sprinkle with fine-chop- 
ped parsley and add a few toast-points. 
Dip the pointed edges of the toast in 
beaten white of egg and then in fine- 
chopped parsley. Any sprouts left over 
will make a good salad. 

Celery, with Beef Marrow 
Allow one head of celery for each 
person to be served ; pare the root neatly 
(that celery is best the roots of which 
have not been pierced with nails) ; trim 
off the rough green stalks; wash in sev- 
eral waters to remove all earth; cut 
all the heads to the same length; cover 
with boiling water, and let boil five 
minutes, then drain and let dry on a 
cloth a few minutes; set the heads into 
a dish where they will lie flat, add salt. 



SARDINE SANDWICHES, WITH CANAI^ES 



Whole cooked chestnuts are often served 
with sprouts in place of the pur^e. 

Brussels Sprouts 
Free' the sprouts of imperfect leaves, 
cover with cold water and let stand 
several hours to become crisp. Drain 
and set to cook in boiling water, slightly 
salted. Cook until tender; often they 
will cook in fifteen minutes, but some-

Drain, add a generous piece of butter, 
a dash of salt and paprika and shaka 
over the fire until the butter is evenly 
mixed through the sprouts. Turn on 



a piece of green or red pepper, a table- 
spoonful of butter and white broth to 
cover; let simmer about one hour or 
until tender. For six heads cut four 
ounces of marrow from a beef bone 
(hind shin) in half-inch slices, let soak 
in cold water, drain, cover with boiling 
water and let simmer one minute, 
drain and it is ready. Pour Madeira 
sauce over the celery and set the marrow 
above.

Many of the dishes for the meals 
to-day (Monday) are prepared from 
the food left over on Sunday (See 
November issue). We will suppose that 
a gas stove is used in preparing the 
meals. When coal is the fuel, imless 
the stove responds very quickly to the 
opening of drafts, the oven will heat 
very slowly and muffins can not be 
attempted save on Sunday. 

First of all, set the sauage cakes in a 
frying pan with boiling water; let the 
water simmer gently about ten minutes, 
— then drain off the water and set the 
sausage into the oven. Shape the left- 
over mashed potato into flat round 



cakes 

On Sunday night, sift the dry in- 
gredients for the muffins into a bowl, 
then, as far as possible, collect the 
utensils and other ingredients needed 
for the muffins, setting the iron muffin 
pan into the oven, that it may be hot 
when the mixture is ready. Use the 
recipe given for Graham Muflins, on 
page, 314, of the November number of 
the magazine, substituting com meal, 
yellow or white, for the Graham flour; 
or, if a richer muffin is wished, take the 
redpegivenon page, 392, of the December 
magazine. When the muffin-mixture 
is ready, remove the pan from the oven 
to the top of the range, rub the inside 
thoroughly with fat, put in the mix- 
ture and quickly set into the oven. 
The muffins should be baked in from 
twenty to twenty-five minutes. At 
the same time let the mashed potato 
cakes, set on a buttered pan, with a 
bit of butter above, bake till lightly 
colored. 

Cut the mush, set aside on Sunday 
in an empty baking powder can, into 
rather thin slices, sift a little flour on 
a plate and in this put the slices of 
mush, first on one side and then on the , 
other; turn a little fat from the sausage 
into a frying pan, put in the mush and 
let fry on one side, then turn to fry the 
other side. Be very careful not to 



THREE MEALS A DAY 



461 



overheat the fat. It is only by giving 
thought to the matter that one acquires 
the habit of using a frying pan hygien- 
ically. If smoke fills the room, discard 
the mush, or the sausage or whatever 
article has been cooked in the fat, 
occasioning the smoke; for it were 
better to lose that part of the break- 
fast than to run the risk of an attack 
of dyspepsia. While these things are 
cooking, set the bread to toast in the 
lower oven. Only one cook in a 
hundred makes toast properly, yet 
half of those ninety-nine cooks satisfy 
the people for whom the toast is made, 
because soft dough inside and a thin 
shell of crispness outside is what is 
desired. This, however, is not toast, 
properly speaking. Such toast may do 
for well people, if they chew it long 
enough, but is not to be given to children 
or to persons of weak digestion. 

Toast, supposedly, is made for people 
who eat too much starch or who do not 
easily digest the starch in bread. By 
a process of long, slow cooking this 
starch is changed to sweet substances, 
then the final browning in high heat 
caramelizes, as it were, these sweet 
substances and gives a sweet tasting 
bit of predigested food. Such pre- 
digested food is valuable for one ill 
or convalescent, when the digestive 
fltiids in the mouth do not flow freely; 
we will all recall that starchy foods are 
digested in the mouth. 

Peel the bananas, scrape to remove all 
coarse threads, then cut in halves cross- 
wise, and these pieces lengthwise. Pat 
these four pieces of each banana in 
flour and set to cook in the pan from 
which the sausage has been taken. 
As soon as the pieces are browned 
delicately on one side, turn to brown 
the other side. Set these around the 
sausage in the serving dish and serve 
both with the mush. Put milk for the 
graham bread to scald in a double 
boiler. 

After breakfast has been cleared 
away, set a cup of dried Lima beans to 



soak in cold water; mix the Graham 
bread, using one whole yeast cake; 
pick the meat from the pieces of chicken, 
left over, cover the bones with cold 
water, add a few celery leaves and stalks, 
an onion, cut in slices, and three sprigs 
of parsley and set to simmer for broth. 
Peel the onions and cover them with 
cold water. Pour cold water (about 
a quart) over half a cup of rice, stir 
with a fork while bringing the water 
quickly to the boiling point, let boil 
two noinutes, drain on a sieve, potir on 
cold water, and when again drained, 
add three tablespoonfuls of butter and 
stir over the fire until the rice has 
taken up the butter; add one cup and 
a half of hot chicken broth (left over) 
and half a cup of tomato pur6e, an 
onion into which two cloves have been 
pushed, three sprigs of parsley, half a 
teaspoonful of salt and one-fourth a 
teaspoonful. of paprika, and let cook 
over boiling water, until the rice is 
tender. Do not stir but keep the 
grains whole. Pick out the onion and 
parsley. While the rice is cooking, set 
an egg over the fire in boiling water, 
let stand over the fire (without boiling) 
ten minutes, then reheat the water to 
the boiling point and let boil one minute; 
at once remove the egg to cold water to 
chill, then remove the shell and cut the 
egg in slices about one-fourth an inch 
thick. Butter a tin mold that holds 
rather less than a quart (about three 
cups), fit a paper in the bottom of the 
mold and butter it thoroughly; on this 
set the slices of egg in regular order or 
pattern; above the egg, spread a layer 
of the rice, then a layer of pieces of 
chicken; season the chicken with a dash 
of salt and pepper and continue the 
layers, until all are used, having the 
last layer rice. Press the mixture into 
the mold; set the mold on many folds 
of paper in a pan. Twenty minutes 
before dinner is to be served, pour 
boiling water aroimd the mold, set the 
whole into the oven and let cook without 
boiling the water. When ready to

serve pour a cup of tomato sauce around 
the pilau, unmolded on a dish. For 
the tomato sauce, melt two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, add two table- 
spoonfuls of flour and one-fotirth a 
teaspoonful, each, of salt and pepper 
and let cook until frothy; then add 
half a cup of tomato purde and half a 
cup of the broth made from the bones, 
etc.; stir until boiling. If fat rises to 
the top of the sauce, remove it with 
tissue or blotting paper. If the rice be 
properly cooked, the pilau will un- 
mold in good shape; it will taste just 
as good, if the shape be not retained. 
The first thing after breakfast is 
cleared away, prepare the squash pie: 
for the fiUing use the recipe given^n 
November, for the little pumpkin pies. 
Lightly flour the board, turn the paste 
(left over) with a knife in the flour, 
then knead lightly and roll into a round 
three-fourths of an inch larger, on all 
sides, than the plate; lay the paste 
even on the plate, then fold the edge 
backward just to meet the plate, all 
around. Flute this double thickness 
of paste with the thumb and fore- 
finger and press each fluting down 
upon the edge of the plate. While 
fluting the pastry lift it, here and there, 
where needed, to let out the air below. 
Leave no large bubble of air between 
paste and plate. Put the pie into a hot 



oven and after ten minutes, lower the 
heat. 

Sherman says that, * 'under favorable 
conditions the growth of children may 
be such as to call for a conversion of 
thirty to forty per cent of the food 
protein into body material and that 
through the whole of infancy and early 
childhood it is wise to use milk as -the 
main source of protein." Also, accord- 
ing to Herter, "many cases of arrested 
development in infancy may be due 
to an insufficient assimiliation of cal- 
cium from the food. This deficiency 
in the amount assimilated may be due 
to defective digestion or to a diet in- 
adequate in calcium content." Taking 
into consideration the foregoing items, 
the use of the remnants of celery — 
calcium is present in fair proportion in 
celery, and milk is especially rich in 
calcium — in a cream of celery soup 
would seem the part of wisdom. Care 
should be exercised in washing the 
celery, for the water in which it is cooked 
as well as the sifted pulp should be 
used in the soup. Stir the flour to be 
used in thickening with cold milk, then 
cook twenty minutes in the rest of the 
milk, heated in a double boiler; an 
onion may be scalded in the milk for 
additional flavor. Cook the Lima beans 
at a gentle simmer that the shape be 
retained. 



Enchantment 



A scarlet flash in the purple sky, 
Like a red flamingo's wing; 
And a thistledown puff, on tne pine's rough coat. 
Where the snow's white fingers cling. 

A diamond dust o'er the stubble field 
And the stream holds a mirror clear, 

While princelings in ermine their jewelled swords 
sheathe 
As into its crystal they peer. 



A tang of frost in the bracing air. 
And the holly's red necklet gleams 

While winds sweep the leaves in a little brown 
drift, 
O'er the bed where a violet dreams. 

An amber rift in the sapphire sky, 
And the golden sun flashes through, 

While deep in my heart blooms a red, red rose, 
That I cherish there, love, for you.

The Big Four 

By Eleanor Robbins Wilson 



UNDER the sharp proddings 
of our present day able statis- 
ticians the American popiilace 
is rousing from its Rip Van Winkle 
slumbers, and the charges hurled at 
this erstwhile indifferent body are indeed 
sufficient to make one **sit up and take 
notice." Far and near rings the accu- 
sation of race deterioration, backed up 
by proof of a gradual shrinkage in the 
height of our adult men, accompanied 
by a corresponding loss of weight. No 
less an authority than the United 
States Census Bureau gives the black 
and white evidence that, while we have 
learned to cope with acute maladies, 
our chronic maladies are on the increase. 
Our death rate is increasing and, to 
further augment the seriousness of the 
situation, our birth rate is decreasing, 
till like Great Britain we are fast near- 
ing the point where our population will 
be stationary. All of which gives foim- 
dation to the alarming charge recently 
made by a professor of entomology 
in the University of California, who 
points out a strange analogy between 
the human race and bees, claiming that 
the increasing number of women, who 
have lost both the instinct and capacity 
for motherhood, are developing a neuter 
type corresponding to the worker-class 
of bees and ants. And that is not all. 
We have in our midst a crop of mental 
defectives, Mr. Statistician again com- 
ing to the front with figures to show 
that they now constitute one per cent 
of our total population. The over- 
whelming result of which is that our 
schools are becoming filled with de- 
fective children, digressing from normal, 
with a long list of ailments, varying 
from flat feet to adenoids. In short, 
they would have us believe that we 
are on the way to utter demoralization. 
But we are not. It is merely the dark- 



ness preceding the dawn, and the usher 
ing in of the new day is the task of those 
special messengers of light that I feel 
warranted in characterizing as the Big 
Four. 

First and foremost of these is the 
Doctor, the new type of doctor, weaned 
from the fallacy of overmuch drugging 
so completely that he openly forsakes 
the ranks of curative medicine for the 
steadily growing cause of preventive 
medical science. The man with the 
welfare of humanity so near at heart 
that he frequently turns his back on 
palliative remedies to tell the lay public 
that the building of the nation's health 
lies in their own hands. 

Already is this being evinced in the 
wide-spread growth of eugenics, the 
increasing number of "better baby" 
shows, and the opening of bureaus for 
instruction in body-building. 

Stamping its hearty approval in 
this matter. Harvard University has 
lately established a chair of preventive 
medicine and hygiene, and is giving 
degrees of "doctor of public health." 

And this year the Marshall County 
Fair, held at Marshalltown, Iowa, added 
a imique feature, in this respect. This 
fair has long been famed as one of the 
best stock fairs in the country. This 
last season they established a Public 
Health Division, and, just as this organ- 
ization has brought its live stock to 
the highest state of cultivation, it 
hopes to educate the country to raise 
the right kind of people. Every day 
during the fair there were lectures by 
physicians, giving health instruction to 
the people, and in prominent places 
were exhibited health placards and 
maxims for daily living. This created 
so much enthusiasm that a county 
conference in health was organized, 
with delegates consisting of every health 



463

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 




informal gathering of friends and neigh- 
bors is often more enjoyable, with a 
simple but substantial supper served 
late, not only because sitting up to the 
small hours makes people hungry, but 
because it is desirable that the New 
Year shall come in while the guests are 
at table. 

As the time of waiting before supper 
sometimes passes rather slowly, it is 
a good plan to provide some occupation 
beside dancing to keep people interested. 
It aflfords amusement to supply each 
person with a pencil and paper, and 
require him to write privately a New 
Year resolution. The resolutions are 
folded separately and mixed in a basket, 



from which everybody present draws 
one, and reads it aloud. As the person 
who draws is supposed to abide by the 
resolution chance allots to him, the 
misfits are sometimes very funny. 

It is a pretty idea to present each 
guest with a Httle souvenir calendar, 
which may easily be made at home. 
Buy a sheet of red mat-board, not too 
stiff, for ten cents, the kind that is used 
for mounting pictures, and cut from it 
bell shapes, like the illustration, about 
four inches long. The pattern should 
be marked on the wrong side, and 
carefully cut with sharp scissors. On 
the lower part of each bell paste a tiny 
calendar, and put the date in large 
figures above it. Through the top of 
the bell tie a red or green ribbon, and 
you will have a souvenir that will 
remind your friends for a year of the 
pleasant evening they had at its begin- 
ning. 

Old-fashioned caraway seed New Year 
cakes should, of course, be among the 
refreshments, and the date may be put 
on them with red frosting, or little 
candies stuck on with white of egg; 
or if the cakes are baked at home, it 
may be marked with a line^of caraway 
seed. 

If there is no striking clock, somebody 
should be appointed to keep track of 
the time, as the hoiu* approaches, and, 
at midnight, to strike twelve times on a 
small bell. 

When there are more than half-a- 
dozen or so persons invited, supper is 
often served at several small tables 
rather than one large one, and, when 
this is done, it is customary for every- 
body to rise, when the New Year comes 
in, and pass from one table to another, 
offering congratulations and good wishes.

The Guest Who "Wants to Help" 

SHE comes rustling blithely into 
the kitchen about an hour before 
luncheon in silken, bewitching morning 
lingerie, just as you are in the very 
midst of the fray — flushed, nervous 
and over-burdened with the hundred 
little and big perplexities known only 
to the mistress of a household who is 
" doing her own work." 

" Now, Cousin Ellen, do let me help 
about lunch— I'd just love to!" she 
gurgles, affectionately. " You mustn't 
make company of me, dear, you know. 
I can always fit right in anywhere, and 
do anything. Just try me! " 

You thank her with a hypocritical 
warmth — a languid seventh smile of 
a seventh smile. Perhaps you are 
performing some especially delicate cul- 
inary operation — dropping oil into your 
mayonnaise, or thickening the cream 
for timbale or ramekin, or straining 
a croquette.. 

You are painfully conscious that your 
hair is all at loose ends, your face tense 
and perspiring, and that no detail of 
your faded, most ancient wrapper is 
being lost upon your cool, fragrant, 
fatiltlessly-groomed guest, who stands 
there smiling and immaculate — every 
puff of her hair shining and symmetrical 
to the ninth degree! 

From your inmost heart you long to 
exclaim " Get out! If you truly want to 
help, leave me alone. Go back to the 
parlor and read, or play the piano, or 



anything else — only let me do my 
work by myself! " 

But the charming little visitor is 
already scurrying about cheerily. " You 
can't stop me. Cousin Ellen! I'm going 
to make you some of my hot biscuit — 
I have the grandest recipe! So — if 
you'll just bring me the butter and lard 
and roUing-pin — .There! I've found 
the flour myself I " and you hear her 
rummaging about in the, pantry, peering 
into pails and jars, all the little secrets 
of your entire manage exposed to her 
bright and curious eyes. How you 
shrink inwardly at thought of those 
unwashed dishes, hidden away back 
of the tins on the cupboard shelf! At 
the pantry floor unsecured, and baking 
bowls lying about in unaccustomed 
places (because of unexpected company) . 

" My dear, did you know your onions 
are simply spoihng here? " with a 
gentle forbearance more maddening than 
frank condemnation. " Now, if you 
arranged these things systematically, 
as I do — ". Or, perhaps, she simply 
follows you about, silently observing 
every process, every action, tintil you 
are nearly on the verge of hysteria. 

" Why, what a queer idea. Cousin 
Ellen! Yoiu* ways are all so different 
from mine. Now, I'm sure it wotild be 
a great saving of your time and strength, 
if you'd try only " etc., etc. Your grim 
silence gives her 'an opportunity to 
continue, sympathetically: 

" Your ^ver needs a little pohshing, 
dear. Do let me rub it over a bit

tomorrow! ** (You know that she will 

have forgotten all about it by tomorrow, 

but will not fail to report to your 

relatives that ** poor Cousin Ellen has 

to let some things go, — a woman 

always slackens a little when the 

children come. But I helped her all 

I could.") 

And, finally, when she overturns that 

fudge-sauce upon her lacey front-breadth 

and with sweet resignation asserts it 

is of no consequence, you are miserably 

conscious that all John's folks will 

promptly learn how she ruined her 

lovely new lingerie preparing Itmcheon 

for dear Ellen; (as a matter of fact, dear 

Ellen would have Itmched off the 

kitchen table, had she had no guests 

about!) 

If you are a sensible woman you 

will say frankly to this polite (?) "I 

thank you, dear girl, but you will 

help me best by leaving me to my fate — 

ir is impossible for me. to work with 

anyone about. I am sure you want to 

conform with the rules of the house — 

there's a dear! You'll find that new 

novel in the library — " and gently and 

firmly close the kitchen door upon your 

officious friend. It is your own fault, 

and you deserve your own humiliation, 

loss of temper and self-respect, if you 

permit even the proverbial inch to this 

especial brand of guest who is so ready 

to take an ell. l. s.

The Salt Cod Dinner 

A STANDBY to the real old New 
Englander, of equal popularity, 
but much less widely known than its 
sister, the boiled dinner, is this original 
Salt Cod meal. 

It came to us direct from a Cape Cod 
Yankee, whose family had practiced it 
for seven good generations, at least. 
Most of us have used it in some form 
or other, — either varying the ingred- 
ients or the manner of service. The 
latter is decidedly part of the game. 

To prepare for a family of two, one 



would require one-third poimd or less 
of salt codfish, four medium-sized 
potatoes, two large beets, two slices 
of salt pork, about two inches square 
and one-half an inch thick, and one cup 
of thin cream sauce. Cut the fish in 
pieces about two-inches square, let 
soak, unless very fresh, and then scald 
successively in three waters. Boil the 
potatoes till mealy, and the beets till 
tender, then skin and slice. Dice the 
salt pork and fry slowly, till there are 
nice, little, light-brown cubes with 
plenty of drippings. Have everything 
ready at the same instant and serve 
as follows, as this materially affects 
the taste of the dinner. 

Our true salt cod devotee will first 
mash the potato with a fork, then shred 
the fish and mix the two. Place the 
sliced beets on this; dice, and mix the 
three. Then distribute the pork scraps 
and drippings well over the top and 
cover all with a generous portion of 
cream sauce. 

This makes a large serving and one 
may hesitate to commence, but will 
enjoy to the last mouthful. It is most 
truly a ** dish " in which the " proof 
of the pudding is in the eating." 

It is easy enough to double or quad- 
ruple the amounts given above, for the 
average or for the large family. It is 
a very simple meal and one that will 
'' stay-by " on the winter days. In 
as much as the ingredients for two 
will cost but from twelve to twenty 
cents, according to the locality, it is 
an inexpensive meal to be stire. h. r.

Tarragon 

MANY Americans are afraid of new 
things, or imagine them costly. 
Tarragon is a plant easily grown, when 
once a root is secured from a dealer; 
it is hardy and lives on year after year. 
The leaves are fine in salads, and are 
used for flavoring many other dishes 
just as parsley is, only being careful 
not to use much of it. The Tarragon

vinegar, made by infusing the leaves in 
good vinegar, is very desirable for 
salads, and many other dishes; often 
a few drops are added to sauces and 
made dishes. 

Orange Salad 

An orange salad is refreshing and 
nice for the winter months. Peel and 
free from all seeds and inner skins 
some nice tart oranges. Grate in a 
little of the rind, if liked, for a game 
course. Dress with salt, pepper, and 
sprinkle with a little "fresh tarragon and 
fine-chopped chives, or shreds of fresh 
onion. Squeeze the juice of one orange 
over, or use French dressing. 

The Glass Shelf 

Glass is an ideal shelfing for a kit- 
chen closet as it can be kept clean 
so easily. If this is too costly, paint the 
shelves white and give a coat of enamel. 
This is easily scrubbed and does away 
with the necessity of papers. 



To prevent ciutains, children's cloth- 
ing, etc, from catching fire, add one 
ounce of phosphate of amnomia to each 
gallon of starch used. Immerse goods, 
wring out and when dry they will be 
fire-proof. This treatment is not in- 
jurious and will not change the appear- 
ance of white doth. The same result 
may be obtained by dissolving two 
ounces of alum in a small quantity of 
rinse water. j. j. o'c. 



New Preparations of Fish for Sun- 
day Night Supper and Lunch- 
eons, or Hors D'Oeuvres for 
Fastidious Spreads 

NOVEL fish prepartions include an- 
chovies put up in glass,with pickles 
and onions. Then too, there are shad 
roes in tin cans. To provide a healthy, 
hungry family with these would hardly 
be advisable, but for epicures it is 
another matter. All kinds of things 



come ready now for quick suppers, 
automobile limcheons and the like. 
The canned shad-roes give those who 
think they never have their share of 
roe at the family table a chance to make 
up for the loss. And the canned fish- 
balls from New England, four or five 
to a can, are a welcome article to the 
bachelor maid who is living in a flat. 
Cod fish, creamed, may not be a luxury, 
but it is a staple, and when one has 
partaken too freely of green food in 
summer, or the digestion is upset, this 
homely dish of the olden time will often 
prove remedial. j. d. c. 

« « * 

ONE of my pet schemes for defy- 
ing moths is to place all small articles 
in glass fruit jars and seal up tight. 

When straining fruit juices for jelly, 
or any hot liquid, in fact, try pinning 
the jelly bag or straining cloth to the 
sides of the dish with clothes pins. It 
will stay in place and save both time 
and patience and, perhaps, a burned 
finger. 



When washing very much soiled cloth- 
ing, such as overalls, childrens' rompers, 
work shirts, etc., place the article on the 
wash board and scrub with an ordinary 
scrub brush. The dirt will be removed 
with ease and less injury to both hands 
and clothes than ordinarily, i. d. s. 



No Wonder 

Dr. Lyman Abott, at a luncheon at 
the Colony Club in New York, was 
good-humrnedly arguing the suffrage 
question with a prominent suffraget. 

**Now, doctor," said the suffraget, 
''there's one thing you must admit. A 
woman doesn't grow warped and hide- 
bound so quickly as a man. Her mind 
keeps younger, fresher." 

**Well, no wonder," Dr, Abbott re- 
torted. **Look how often she changes 
it!"

Query 2106. — "In making cake, some direc- 
tions say, beating the mixture after the flour 
is added makes the cake tough; other directions 
say beat three minutes before the whites are 
added; which directions are correct?" 

Mixing Cake 

Before buying cook-books that are 
simply a compilation of recipes, each 
individual assajring to prepare food 
for others to eat, should own a cook- 
book giving minute directions as to 
methods of manipulating food materials 
and the reasons thereof. A thought- 
ful study of such a book would put 
such procedtires as the mixing of cake 
before one in a manner not to be for- 
gotten and, if directions were followed, 
would insure uniformly good results. 
In cake-making we recognize two dis- 
tinct kinds of cake. These cakes are 
butter cakes, and true sponge cakes. 
Butter cakes contain shortening, usually 
butter, and are lightened, in part, by 
soda and^cream of tartar, or some variety 
of baking powder. True sponge cakes 



are made without butter and are 
lightened entirely by air, beaten into 
eggs, and the expansion of this air 
when heated. The manner of mixing 
these two varieties of cake are entirely 
different. In the above query the 
first question refers to mixing sponge 
cake, the second to butter cakes. 

Mixing Butter Cakes 

Cream the butter, using an earthen 
bowl and a wooden spoon, to avoid 
discoloring the ingredients; add the 
sugar gradually, beating constantly; 
add yolks of eggs, beaten until thick 
and light-colored. If more sugar is 
to be used than can be creamed easily 
with the butter, add it to the yolks 
and with them to the rest of the sugar 
and butter; then add the liquid, fol- 
lowed by the flour and leavening in- 
gredients sifted together, or add the 
liquid and flour, alternately. Then beat 
in the whites of the eggs, beaten dry. 
At last, beat the mixture thoroughly 
^ to secure a fine grained cake. 

Mixing Sponge Cake 

As the lightness of sponge cake 
depends entirely upon the air incor- 
porated into the eggs, of which it is 
largely composed, and the expansion 
of this air in baking, great care must 
be taken, first, to sectu"e the incorpora- 
tion of air in the mixttire, and then 
to regulate the baking so as to retain 
the same — i.e., never stir a sponge 
cake mixture; let the heat be such 
that the enclosed air can be gradually 
heated, and the cell-walls fixed, when 
the air becomes fully expanded. Beat 
the yolks with an egg-beater until 
very light and thick; add the sugar 
gradually, beating continuously, then 
add the flavoring. Beat the whites 
until stiff and dry; cut and fold part 
of the whites into the yolks and sugar, 
then cut and fold in part of the flour; 
now, in the same order, the remaining 
whites and flour. If preferred, add 
the whites, then the flour entire. Bak

in an tinbuttered pan, made for the 
purpose, and let the cake stand in 
the inverted pan to cool. Thus sus- 
pended, as it were, from the floor 
of the pan, the cake will be much lighter, 
than when it is left to hold up its own 
weight while cooling. 



Query 2107. — "In recipes for Oatmeal Cookies, 
what kind of oatmeal is called for, Scotch oat- 
meal or rolled oats?" 

Oatmeal for Cookies 

In all cookies, quickly made and baked 
rolled oats are called for. Time is a 
consideration when Scotch oatmeal is 
employed. 



Query 2108. — "Recipe for fine-grained, plain, 
Layer Cake to be used with Chocolate Frosting. 
Wish the mixture to contain more yolks than 
whites." 

Yellow Layer Cake

a wooden bowl; chop very fine. Add all

Hard-Cooked Eggs for Salads, etc. 

Take a granite ware saucepan hold- 
ing rather more than a quart; in it 
heat one quart of water to the boiling 
point and move the saucepan to a 
place on the stove where the water 
will retain its heat but not boil; lower 
an egg into it, cover close and let stand 
eight minutes; bring the water with 
the egg quickly to the boiling point 
and let boil one minute, then drain and 
cover with cold water. Thus cooked 
the egg will retain its tenderness, except 
just beneath the shell; it will shell 
easily, leaving a smooth surface, and 
will cut in better slices than when 
the outside is less firm.

Scotch Shortbread 

(By one living over 50 years in Scotland) 

There are only 3 ingredients in 
Scotch shortbread: 1 lb. flour (4 cups), 
one-half pound butter (2 cups), one- 
fourth pound sugar (three-fourths cup), 
no milk, eggs, baking powder or salt. 

Put the flour, butter and sugar on 
a baking board, letting the board rest 
against the wall, to keep it from moving 
round the table. Break the butter in 
small pieces and work into a Itunp by 
rubbing along the board with your 
flat hand and wrist. Roll the lump 
into a sheet three-fourths of an inch 
thick, cut in four pieces and prick all 
over with a silver fork. Put in a 
hot oven for 5 minutes, then let cool 
a little and bake 25 minutes longer. 
When baked it should be of a very 
pale, amber tint.

Query 21 17.~"l8 it still customary to uae 
fingerbowls at a company dinner and how are

Use of Fingerbowls 

Fingerbowls are used at meals of 
ceremony and often at the family table. 
They are passed, one to each individual, 
on doily-covered plates. At dinner the 
doily and bowl are often taken from 
the plate and set upon the table by 
each individual, and the plate is used 
for cake or bonbons passed by the maid. 
At breakfast the fingerbowls are usually 
removed after the fruit course.

the eating of the soup. 

. Query 2 119.—" When are olives eaten? If 
nuts are on the table at the beginning of a meal, 
when are they eaten? When should celery, 
olives and nuts be removed?" 

Place of Olives, Celery and Nuts 

Olives and celery are usually eaten 
with the soup. They sometimes appear 
in a hors d'oeuvre dish of several com- 
partments or are provided with other 
relishes passed before soup. When no 
salad is served with roast turkey or 
chicken, celery is often passed with 
this course. These relishes are removed 
from the table when the course of which 
they form a part — whatever that 
course may be — is finished. Salted 
nuts belong to no particular course 
and usually remain on the table through- 
out the dinner. They are eaten at 
any time, often between courses. 

Query 2120.— "For a four or five course 
meal, should all the silver be set in place when 
the table is laid, or should part of it be brought 
in later, as needed?" 

Disposal of Silver on Dinner Table 

By a comparison of the tables, set 
for various functions, shown in this 
magazine and of the menus accompany- 
ing them, the disposition of silver in 
the covers advocated by this magazine 
can be easily seen. For instance, in 
the November number, the frontispiece 
shows a table laid for dinner; on the 
reverse of the page is the menu. In 
each "cover," at the right is spoon 
for grapefruit cocktail, soup spoon and 
knife for turkey; on the left is fork for 
fish, which also answers for the salad 
served with the fish, fork for tiu^key, 
also used for the vegetables served 
with this course, and, last, the smaller 
fork for the game and cauliflower 
served with this course. Sometimes 
the silver for the dessert course is set 



above the plate, when the table is laid, 
but it is in the way, when the table is 
freed of crumbs (before the dessert is 
served) and it is preferable to set such 
silver in place just before the dessert 
is served. This, however, is largely a 
matter of individual taste. 



Query 2121.— "How are euests seated at 
table so that there may be no break in the alter- 
nation of ladies and gentlemen.?" 

Seating Guests at Table 

The host with lady guest of honor go 
into the dining-room first; the lady sits 
at right of host; others follow, each lady 
being seated at the right of the gentleman 
whom she accompanies; the hostess 
comes in last with the gentleman guest 
of honor who sits at her left; by this 
procedure a lady is at the right of each 
gentleman, no matter now many guests 
there are at table. The difficulty re- 
ferred to in the query arose from 
changing the order, when it came to 
the hostess; of course the gentleman 
accompanying her sits at her left, 
thus bringing her to his right hand.

Only Manicured Waiters 

Art Demands It and They Don't Mind at the House's Expense 



WHEN Napoleon whisked the con- 
somme away from under one's 
nose yesterday at lunch time one star- 
tled glance was caught by a thumb nail 
that shone. One gazed, as if fascinated 
One is not in the habit of admiring the 
fingernails of waiters, and sometines, 
when one suddenly beholds them and 
thinks of the soup that one has just 
eaten, one shudders. But here Napo- 
leon presented a set of nails, as was 
revealed by later scrutiny, that looked 
as beautifully groomed as if a manicure 
had just bren at work on them. In 
amazement one asked for Jules, the 
maitre d'hotel of the Caf6 de Paris. 
where the phenomenon recorded had 
been observed. 




"It is not only Napoleon, Monsieur. 
All the waiters here must visit the 
manicure," Jules said. "We have come 
to the conclusion that it is time that 
everything possible must be done to 
gratify the artistic and the aesthetic 
sense of the diner-out. Therefore, yes- 
terday we installed the manicurist, and 
issued orders that each waiter should 
go to her and have his nails attended to 
at the expense of the house. 

"Nobody objected. The manicure is 
an attractive young lady, and whether 
it was the idea of having the hand held 
that appealed to the men, or the pros- 
pect of having the nails put in perfect 
order at no expense, I do not know. But 
I do know that yesterday twenty-five 
waiters had their hands fixed up, and 
to-day the manicurist has been busy." 

It was natural that some incredulity 
should be expressed. Jules looked 
pained,and insisted upon leading the way 
to an upper floor, where, sure enough, 
in one of the rooms a waiter, with 
an embarrassed look on his face, was 
holding on to a table with one hand 
while over the other a manicure lady 
was working energetically. 

"Behold, Monsieur," said Jules. One 
was forced to believe one's eyes. 



Politeness Killed by Etiquette 

AS he stood watching a funeral 
pass by, an old genlteman was 
polishing his glasses. He readjusted 
them and noticed some small school- 
boys standing caps in hand. "Ah," he 
murmured with satisfaction, "the coun- 
try is getting more polite; they never 
used to do that sort of thing!" The 
old gentleman was right; politeness 
has had a iillip during the past few 
years, but in higher circles it is gov- 
erned by etiquette to such an extent

that in many instances it is bad form. 
For instance, at a dinner party you 
will notice that a polite lady will acknow- 
ledge a servant passing a dish with a 
"thank you." This is very nice, but 
unfortunately very wrong, as etiquette 
rules that it is the servant's duty and 
does not require such acknowledgment. 
On the other hand, if he (or she) passes 
you something by request then the 
acknowledgment is not out of place. 
When served with vegetables or any- 
thing contained in a dish from which 
you have to help yourself, the waiter 
is supposed to hold the dish steady. 
You must not endeavour to steady it 
with one hand, but struggle through as 
best you can. You must not attempt 
to pass up plate for setxind helpings; 
that is the servant's duty, so that how- 
ever ungrateful you nay feel yourself 
to be, remember that socially you are 
not. You will perhaps think yourself 
rude; but the company wUl look upon 
your behaviour as id^. That is the 
way of things nowadays. 



How to Carve a Roast Turkey

the fork firmly through the 
upper part of the breast-bone, pass 
the knife first around the leg and remove 
it, then the wing, first oa one side then 
on the other. By cutting the liga- 
ments the joints will readily open. 
When these have been displaced cut 
the breast in thin slices, using the 
knife flat against the breast and cutting 
from you; then slip it underneath the 
wishbone; lift, press it backward, and 
remove it. Turn the turkey slightly 
so that you may cut the shoulder blades 
from the underside of the backbone 
without removing the carving-fork. 
Then cut directly through the ribs up 
to the brestbone joint, and turn the 
turkey first one side and then the other, 
separating the back of the carcass from 
the breast. Then, for the first time, 
remove the fork. Divide the upper 
from the lower part of the back; cut 
down the backbone, and divide the

He Learned How it Was Done 

ELIHU Root tells a story about 
himself and his efforts to correct 
the manners of his oEBce boy. One 
morning the young autocrat came into 
the office, and tossing his cap at a hook, 
exclaimed : 

"Say, Mr. Root, there's a ball game 
down at the park to-day, and I want to 
go down." 

Now the great lawyer was willing that 
the boy should go, but thought he 
would teach him a little in good man- 
ners. 

"James." he said, "that isn't the 
way to ask a favor. Now you sit down 
in my chair and I'll show you how to 
do it properly." 

The boy took the office chair, and 
his employer picked up his cap and 
stepped outside. He then opened the 
door softly, and, holding the cap in his 
hand, said: 

"Please, sir, there is a ball game at 
the park to-day; if you can spare me I 
would like to get away for the after- 
noon." 

In a flash the boy resopnded: 

"Why, certainly, Jimmie; and here 
is fifty cents to pay your way in."

Russian Tea 

In this country, we are apt to think 
that we need only put a slice of lemon 
into our tea to transform it into Russian 
. tea. It is true that Russians some- 
times take tea with lemon, but the real 
national drink is taken with jam. Your 
hostess gracefully makes her tea in 
your presence, using the steaming water 
from the samovar to keep her tea con- 
tinually boiling hot. She serves the 
men their tea in crystal tumblers, the 
women theirs in dainty cups. With 
the tea you are passed different kinds 
of fruit preserves, so that you can choose 
a favourite. The jams are eaten from 
small plates of some pretty deagn. 
The Russians generally drop the jam 
right into their tea. 

The Russians do not serve the tea 
with their meal, but after it. If they 
can conveniently do so, they let a 
whole hour elapse between dinner and 
tea. The table is transformed before 
tea is served. It is at the tea table 
that the Russian lady displays her love 
for daintiness. Her finest linen, her 
choicest bits of silver, porcelain and 
crystal are reserved for the tea drinking. 
The main meal sometimes lacks in the 
serving the highly developed daintiness 
so characteristic of the homes of the 
well-bred Americans, but at her tea- 
table the Russian lady is a perfect artist. 

Besides the jams, delicious candies and 
cakes are served with the tea. Candied 
cranberries are a delicate novelty offered 
us with tea by a gracious Russian 
hostess. And, by the way, to be fit 
for this preparation, the berries have 
not only to be quite ripe, but also 
slightly frost-bitten. 

The Russians love their samovar. 
They gather about it as we do about 
the fireside, with almost a feeling of 
reverence. If you would get near to 
the hearts of the Russians, you must 
sip tea with them about their glowing, 
puffing, welcoming and inspiring samo-

The Correct Way to Pour Tea 
Few hostesses seem to understand 
the right way of pouring tea, siin{^ 
as it appears. As a rule, the guest 
of honour is offered the first cup, which 
is the weakest, and the children, if 
served at all, are given the last and 
strongest. When it is desirable to have 
all the cups of uniform strength, one 
should pour a little into each, and begin 
over again, reversing the order. 



Revenge of a Vegetarian 

A party of vegetarians paid a visit 
to the country, and after a few hours' 
ramble in the woods and fields pro- 
posed to finish up their hitherto pleasant 
outing by a picnic tea party. 

After getting comfortably seated to 
the spread on the grass they were slightly 
disturbed. 

A bull made his appearance in a rather 
hasty manner.spreading confusion amoi^ 
the party, each trying to get over 
the stile first. 

One old lady ran, panting, behind, 
reaching the stile only just in time to 
save herself by scrambling through it 
and falling in a heap on the other side. 
On regaining her feet she turned to 
the bull and breathlessly exclaimed: 

"That's your gratitude, is it? I 
haven't eaten a bit of beef for the last 
two years; but I'll make up for it now, 
you ungrateful creature!"

SILVER-CLEAN PAN 

il now a necessity, we quote {ma an article in Tbe 
Howekeeper Magazine, March 1912 issue, ovei ibe 
agnalme of Margaret Soiin<lstiom, Teache» College, 
Cdumbia University, as follows: 

"The task of nlvcs cleaning need not appaQ d>e 
housekeeper, as there is, for instance, now on the muket 
a SILVER-CLEAN PAN that, at it* maker »yi. 
" makes the tamish vanish like clouds before the mommg 
tun." In using this all ihat one hat lo do is to place the 
P.t.J«.ll,Ull.»JAai.U.liU articles lo be cleaned (gold or tilver) in tbe pan b a 

solution of warm water, baking soda and ordinary table tall, leaving them there torn one to five 
minutes. All that it then required is to rinse the silver and dry it with a clean chamois skin or 
toll cloth. In fact, this pan does away with all the dreaded labor of cleaning the tilver. Elabo- 
rate tilver, such as toilet articles, may be cleaned ia the tame way with no effort whatsoever. 
Not the slightest mjury is done the lilvet and it will have a luster like new." 

It teems uselen for us to say more, as undoubtedly most of the tubiciibert lo tfaii magazine 
ate acquainted with Margaret Soundiliom's wrihngs on Domestic Science, and further know sbe

Ivory Soap three times a day for washing dishes began 



Whenever their odd pieces of fine china had to be washed they naturally turned to 
Ivory just as they would think of using nothing else for their fine linens, laces, etc. 

The use of Ivory Soap for this exacting work proved so satisfactory — it made 
the dishes so scrupulously clean without harming their delicate decorations and it 
left the hands so soft and smooth — that they soon began to use it for the general 
dish- washing. 

If you do not wash your dishes with Ivory Soap this is an excellent way to test it and 
find out for yourself that its use is a real economy. Wash some of your better china 
with it; its all-around superiority due to its purity, mildness and freedom from alkali 
will be so evident that you will be glad to do all your dish-washing in the same way.

An Entirely New Cook Book by Miss Farmer * 

A NEW BOOK OF COOKERY

Sioce its original publication, Miss Farmer's "Boston Cooking 
School Cook Book" has, in new editions, incorporated large addi- 
tions, but the wealth of new material — the result of experiments 
in the author's classrooms and embodied in recipes which have 
been thoroughly tested — has grown to such an extent that it has 
become necessary to incorporate it in a separate volume which 
forms an almost indispensable companion to the author's invalu- 
able "Boston Cooking School Cook Book." 

The " New Book of Cookery" contains more than eight hun- 
dred recipes upon all branches, including many new and import- 
ant dishes not to be found in any other wort. It is profusely 
illustrated.

"A Reversion to Type" 

The Home of Mr. Reed Knox at Valley Forge 

By Charles Vaughn Boyd 
Dukring, Okie and Ziegler, Architects, Philadelphia 



INTERWOVEN as it is with the 
very birth of our nation, Valley 
Forge possesses an interest unique 
and abiding. It is, indeed, for loyal 
Americans a spot hallowed by the mem- 
ory of those patriots, who there bravely 
and gladly endured privations untold. 
that a new country might rise into being. 
Washington's Headquarters, that old 
building which is so closely associated 
with Valley Forge's early history-making 
days, is now surrounded by a Govern- 
ment Reservation — a huge tract of 
land, embracing magnificent, wooded 
heights, and fertile, rolling meadows. 
Sharing in all this glorious scenic heri- 
tage, Valley Forge Farm, the country 
estate of the Honorable Philander C. 
Knox, is ideally situated immediately 
beyond the bounds of the Reservation. 
Valley Forge Farm is an estate of almost 
feudal proportions. It possesses, there- 
fore, many delightful vantage points, 
one of the most delightful of which 
was set aside several years ago by Mr. 
Knox for his son, Mr. Reed Knox. 

Think what might have been built 
on this well-nigh ideal site! Replica 
of medieval castle, Elizabethan mansion, 
Swiss chalet, or ancient mission. In- 
stinctively, we know that none of these 
would have been in the slightest degree 



appropriate in a purely Colonial atmo- 
sphere. Fortunately, however, there is, 
upon this Pennsylvania farm hillside, 
a house, unpretentious yet dignified 
in character; a house faithfully adhering 
in its design to the spirit of early farm- 
house architecture in Pennsylvania. Be- 
cause of this reversion to a type native 
to the soil, Mr. Reed Knox's house is 
indeed notably in harmony with its 
environment — and, in view of this 
perfect relationship existing between

house and site, ^s it not superfluous to 
add that commendatory term, "suc- 
cessful' ' ? 

Leaving the main road of the estate, 
a broad driveway winds up the hillside 
to Mr. Knox's home grounds, the bounds 
of which are defined by a low, white- 
washed fence, such as might have been 
used on farms of a hundred years ago. 
Thus in details, which are often over- 
looked, a pleasing consistency has pre- 
vailed. 

Ere reaching the main entrance of 
the house, the driveway passes the 
service wing. Unlike many other homes, 
however, the Knox house betrays no 
sharp distinction between the front 
and rear elevations; the service wing, 
with its massive, dominating chim- 
ney, and its screened, old-fashioned, 
servants' porch, vieing in attractive- 
ness with the balance of the house. 

This new-old house is solidly built 
of stone, whitewashed to conform with 
a custom obtaining in the locality's 
Colonial days. The irregular texture 
of the stonework creates a splendid 
foundation for this dazzling white. 



making it a thing of beauty, with a 
delightful play of high and low lights, 
against which the "weathered" shingles 
of the roof and the deep green blinds 
of the upper windows are in effective 
contrast. 

The main entrance to the house is 
denoted by a broad hood, in which the 
"shell" motif is indicated by a plastered 
recess. Beneath the hood, there is a 
wide, six -paneled door, flanked by small- 
paned side lights. This interesting door- 
way is duplicated upon the garden 
elevation of the house. There, how- 
ever, the shell above the doorway forms 
the central feature of a "Germantown 
Hood," which, extending the full width 
of the house, materially decreases the 
apparent height. 

These two entrances add much to 
the attractiveness of the long, central 
hall which they terminate. The hall 
is nine feet wide, and it is very simply 
treated, both as to architecture and 
decoration; a staircase, with delicate, 
ivory-white balusters and risers, accom- 
panied by the mahogany handrail and 
treads of Colonial precedent, being the 



THE LIVING-ROOM 



"A REVERSION TO TYPE" 



chief feature. The space beneath this 
staircase has been advantageously util- 
ized for a coat-closet, so located that 
it is conveniently near the main entrance. 

The hall walls are hung with a sub- 
dued gray paper, which is very effective 
against the ivory-white woodwork. 
Gray appears again in the rug, form- 
ing a background for a small conven- 
tional design in dull rose and green. 
Several pieces of antique furniture 
complete a hall, which, by reason of its 
wholesome restraint in adornment and 
coloring, creates an atmosphere of pleas- 
ing restfulness. 

Commanding delightful outlooks in 
three directions, the living-room occu- 
pies the entire space at one side of 
the hall. It is a pleasant, low-ceiled 
room, twenty-seven and a half feet 
long by seventeen feet wide, so gener- 
ously provided with windows that the 
great outdoor world seems indeed 
almost to pervade it. One wall is centred 
by a broad chimney-breast, the open 
fireplace having a hearth and facing 
of stone, laid with a. 'wide, raked-out 
joint. An original idea, successfully 
carried out. was that of substituting 
for the conventional mantel a shelf 
formed of long, flat stone. Above this 
novel shelf is appropriately hung a 
gilt Colonial mirror. The wall space 
on each side of the fireplace is occupied 
by French casements and by glass- 
doored, built-in bookcases. 

As the living-room has a sunny 
exposure, the old blue foundation of 
the color-scheme is a happy choice. 
Blue predominates on the rug, which 
has an unpattemed centre, bordered 
with a conventional design in bright 
tints, corresponding with the decorative 
chintz hangings. The plain wall-hang- 
ing repeats the blue note; and the gaily 
, flowered chintz chair-coverings add the 
requisite relieving touches. 

Many living-rooms are marked by 
an absence of what should be the out- 
standing characteristic — a quality, 
which for lack of a more expressive 



CORNER OF DINING-BOOM 

term, we designate as "liveablencss". 
The Knox living-room is essentially 
liveable; for it is furnished with a view 
to both comfort and beauty. Without 
the slightest incongurity, furniture of 
priceless old mahogany and antique 
painted wood mingles, with examples 
of modern wicker, lending an alluring 
informality to the room. 

French casements lead from the liv- 
ing room to a wide porch, the floor 
of which is paved with bricks, laid 
in fours to form square units. The porch 
is raised only a single step above the 
■lawn; therefore, instead of a balus- 
trade, potted palms and sword ferns 
bound the porch. The square posts, 
devoid of mouldings, which support 
the porch roof, carry out the Penn- 
sylvania farm-house motif : in addition, 
they lend themselves particularly well 
to the glazing of the porch to form a 
solarium. Furniture of green wicker 
with chintz cushions in green, red and 
white, is used with good effect on the 
porch. 

Although readily accessible from the 
living-room, the dining-room is far 
enough removed to warrant an entirely 



510 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



different color-scheme. That, however, 
this scheme may be in harmony with 
that of the hall adjoining, the walls 
are hung with paper of warm gray tones. 
The wallpaper is a clever reproduction of 
a very old pastoral design, groups of 
cattle and sheep alternating in a foliage 
setting. In this design, so suggestive 
of farm life, there is still another evi- 
dence of the pronounced harmony be- 
tween the house and its surroundings. 
The rug is of gray-green, the plain 
centre carrying a narrow conventional 
border, which in design corresponds 
with the band of stencilling upon the 
gray scrim curtains. With this cool, 
quiet setting, the Colonial furniture 
of inlaid mahogany is thoroughly satis- 
fying. 

The dining-room contains two archi- 
tectural features of note. The first 
is a large bvdlt-in china-closet, enameled 
ivory-white to match the remainder 
of the woodwork. The design possesses 



much compositional charm — the lines 
are good, the paneling and the glass- 
doors being especially well handled. 
The other noteworthy feature of the 
dining-room is the fireptace. It is 
of a type rarely encountered in modem 
work; as, instead of the usual stone, 
brick or tile, the facing is of white 
plaster. Against the lining and hearth 
of dark red brick, the effect of this 
white plaster is lUiusually interest- 
ing; and the simple white mantel 
framing the plaster is in keeping with 
the Colonial spirit of the room. 

That much care has been lavished 
upon its planning is plainly indicated 
by the excellent arrangement of the 
service department. A large and well- 
equipped pantry serves as a quick 
passage from the kitchen to either 
the hall or the dining-room, shutting 
off the inevitable odors of cooking. In 
the kitchen, the built-in fixtures are 
so placed that the household work

"A REVERSION TO TYPE" 



FIRST FLOOR PLAN 



SECOND FLOOR PLAN 



may be handled with the greatest 
ease and with the fewest steps. The 
location of the range is especially 
good, as abundant light is received 
from an adjoining window; and, in 
addition, this position necessitates only 
one chimney to serve both the dining- 
room fireplace and the kitchen. Good 
refrigerating facilities are afforded by 
a cold-closet, which is connected with 
the kitchen. 

Although an adequate heating sys- 



tem is installed for possible winter 
service, the house is intended principally 
for summer occupation. No provision 
is made, therefore, for a servants' 
dining-room. Dimng the warm weather, 
however, the servants have a delight- 
ful open-air dining-room, a generous 
porch for that use having been pro- 
vided. 

The main staircase ascends by easy 
stages to a small central hall on the 
second floor. From this hall, passages 



512 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



lead to left and right. One passage 
is isolated to give a separate suite, this 
inner hall communicating with the 
servants' bath and sleeping rooms, 
and with the service stairs to the kit- 
chen. The second passage leads to 
a very pleasant guest-room and bath- 
room. The garden elevation of the 
second floor is occupied by the master's 
suite, comprising two large bedrooms, 
with a private bathroom. This suite 
is interesting, both in decoration and 
planning. Each of the family bedrooms 
possesses roomy closets, an attractive 
fireplace and three large windows, to 
insure cross-ventilation. Quaint, old- 
fashioned papers in delicate tints adorn 
the walls of all the bedrooms, and ivory- 
white enamel finishes the woodwork; 
mahogany doors and antique furniture 
give desirable touches of virility. 

Abimdant space is provided in the 
house for storage, the entire third 
floor being available for that purpose. 
Two large closets, opening from the 



second floor hall, give still further 
storage room. 

The Knox house eloquently testifies 
to two conditions, which have, per- 
haps, been the chief contributaries to 
its gratifying success. First, possibly, 
should be placed an evidently hearty 
co-operation between owner and archi- 
tects, as, without that unanimity of 
spirit, the designers' ideas could not 
have taken corporate shape. The sec- 
ond contributary is not less important. 
Instead of despising those things which 
were near at hand, the architects 
found inspiration in the simple Penn- 
sylvania farmhouses of a by-gone gen- 
eration . They absorbed the chaste spirit 
of the old designs; and embodied all 
that spirit in a home, which, never- 
theless, meets every modem condition. 
To the architects, in thus perpetuat- 
ing, amid peculiarly fitting surround- 
ings, a type of architecture so essentially 
indigenous to Pennsylvania, honor is 
indeed due. 



The Deleted Lines 

How little of life I have kept! Old hopes and 
fears 
Alike from the changing canvas swept. 
How small in my heart the picture of largest 
years! 
How little of life I have kept ! 

Oh, what of the grief? — forgot ton the sorrows 

I wept! 
And joy? — the laughter has passed with the 

tears! 
And pride? — no path holds the print where I 

stepped ! 



Peace, O my heart! However my fortune 
veers, 
The gift of the day let me accept. 
Still keeping, at last, but the good, the remem- 
brance that cheers! — 
How little of life I have kept !

A Valentine Doll 



By Mix Thorn 



MISS Lucy was pouring tea 
into the dainty blue and 
gold cups, that were stand- 
ing on the dark mahogany table before 
her, and close to her blue silk elbow 
stood seven-year-old Dorothy, watch- 
ing her with adoring eyes. How white 
and soft were Miss Lucy's hands, 
how sparkling her rings, and how lovely 
the silk gown that in azure ripples 
followed the curve of the wicker chair. 
And then the child's eyes grew sober. 
What had Miss Lucy just said! 
How sad and dreadful! That she had 
no doll, did not own a single doll. Why 
she, Dorothy, had ten dolls, large 
ones, small ones, middle-sized, and — 
still she heard Miss Lucy's soft voice 
saying, **Why no, dear, I gave my last 
doll away several years ago." 

Then two dignified ladies came up 
to the tea table, and visited with Miss 
Lucy, while they drank their tea, 
very slowly, and Dorothy moved quietly 
away. It was her joy to call upon 
Miss Lucy, especially on the days 
when she poured tea, and the gentle 
hostess never neglected her youngest 
guest. 

Half an hour later, Katrina came 
for Dorothy, for the great outdoors 
was darkening, and the street lights 
were glowing like miniature moons. 
All the while the maid was putting 
on her coat, furs and hat, the child 
was lost in reverie, and, unseeing, she 
walked along the windy Avenue. What 
could be done for Miss Lucy, dear 
Miss Lucy, who seemed to have every- 
thing desirable but a doll, and what 
a lack that was! True, she went to 
parties, hadn't Dorothy seen the lovely 
filmy gowns that she wore on such 
occasions? She knew that Miss Lucy 
and her friends drove away to concerts 



and theatres, but she must sometimes 
fed the need of a doll. When she came 
home late, very late through the lighted 
streets, when the mysterious stars were 
out, long after a little girl's bed time, 
what a comfort a doll would then be, 
a cheerful, dependable doll, to sit 
by the fire with her, possibly on her 
lap. 

Perhaps, if Miss Lucy felt lonely, 
she might easily take a doll with her 
into that canopied, lace-trimmed bed 
of hers. Well did Dorothy know the 
comfort of a doll on sundry trying 
occasions. A cold hard cheek to press 
against a soft, flushed one, and then, 
all troubles forgotten, to drift off to 
the land of dreams, clinging to a dim- 
pled plaster hand. 

Upon reaching home, she gravely 
examined her doll family, each one 
in turn, from the largest doll who spent 
most of her time in her go-cart to the 
tiniest member who lived in the paste 
board doll-house, content to view the 
passing show, through red isinglass 
windows. 

How, Dorothy asked herself, how 
could she spare any of these, her loved 
children? And, yet. Miss Lucy had 
no doll. 

Next morning, at breakfast, the little 
girl looked up from her orange, to 
inquire of the assembled family, — 
"What sort of a doll would one give 
to a young lady?" 

**A boy doll," was Uncle Ned's reply, 
Uncle Ned was in Yale, and had just 
run down for the week-end. 
' **I guess she'd like a girl doll better," 
made answer Dorothy, yet she looked 
troubled, 

"Why, darUng," said mother, "I 
believe a yotmg lady, an understanding 
young lady, would love just the 8 or 
513 



514 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



of a doll a little mother, like yourself, 
would choose.'' 

But it was after talking it over with 
Grandma Perkins, in the big sunny 
room where the children loved to stay, 
that Dorothy at last decided what 
she wotdd do. Grandma didn't think 
she ought to give away any of her dear 
doll family, which was a comfort, 
but instead, she and Grandma Perkins 
would go down to the biggest toy shop 
in town and pick out a lovely doll for 
Miss Lucy, and send it to her for a 
valentine. 

Theirs was no easy task, a certain 
bright wintry morning, the toy shop 
had quantities of dolls to show, and 
many of the blue-eyed, and brown-eyed 
babies seemed desirable, nay more, 
appealing, as if saying '*Send us to 
Miss Lucy." But, at last, both Grandma 
Perkins and Dorothy agreed on a 
blonde beauty, who held out her arms 
in the most friendly fashion, smiled 
inscrutably, and who was dressed in 
the daintiest little white frock, with a 
wild pink bow on either shotdder. 

Tenderly Miss Lucy's doll was 
wrapped in the softest tissue paper, 
and then placed in the box, and Grand- 
ma Perkins directed it in her deKcate, 
spidery handwriting. Then it was given 
to Wilkins, the diauffeur, to deliver 
next morning, for that was the four- 
teenth of February. 

Straight up to Miss Lucy's own 
little sitting room the maid brought 
the mysterious, long box that Grandma 
Perkins had directed. 

"And whatever is this?" cried Miss 
Lucy, her pink cheeks flushing pinker 
than usual, as she eagerly untied the 
gold cord. 

"Why, what does it mean?" she 
exclaimed, as the smiling dollie met 
her astonished eyes, and then she read 



the little card on which Dorothy had 
laboriously printed — 

"A Valentine for Dear Miss Lucy, 
who had no doll." 

"The blessed child," whispered Miss 
Lucy, "my own dear little friend," 
and tears filled her wide gray eyes. 
"To think she remembered what I 
said. This is my very nicest valen- 
tine; yes," looking around the room, 
"my very nicest," and though a won- 
derful bunch of violets, as fragrant 
as the spring itself, stood on the table 
in a clear glass bowl, and tall long- 
stemmed roses occupied a vase on the 
mantle, while some splendid boxes 
of chocolates rested on the couch, I 
yet think that Miss Lucy was right, 
and that Dorothy's doll was her nicest 
valentine 

I wish that the little girl could have 
seen what Miss Lucy did next, for 
she cuddled her new doll on her shoulder 
in the most natural fashion, and even 
pressed her lips to the very blonde 
curls. 

You see it was not so many years 
since Miss Lucy had played with a doll, 
and she had not quite forgotten what 
to do with one. 

"But I do wonder," mused that 
young lady an hour later, as she stood 
before her mirror adjusting her hat, 
"I do wonder after all, why Dorothy 
sent a doll to such a very grown-up 
person as myself." 

And though she did not guess, I 
really think her mirror might have 
told her, for the reflected eyes were 
innocent and trusting as Dorothy's 
own, holding in some marvelous fashion, 
their little girl look, as if Miss Lucy 
still felt the call of Toy Land, and, 
recognizing this, her little friend, with 
the unerring intuition of childhood, 
had sent — a Valentine Doll. 




English and American Homes 

A Contrast in Conditions 

By Annie Mitchell 



AN American visiting an English 
home is at once impressed with 
the noiseless manner in which 
the household machinery moves. You 
hear no dire tales from the mistress of 
the home about the inefficiency of ser- 
vants, and yet the conditions that exist 
there are such that house-work ought 
to be much harder than it is with us. 

Let us take, for example, two very 
important factors in the running of a 
house — namely, water supply and heat- 
ing. The physical tax upon an English 
servant by those two things alone is 
quite inconceivable in America, where 
such different conditions obtain. Dur- 
ing a two years' sojourn in Englnad, I 
only found one home that was heated 
" by pipes," as they say there, and 
then heat was only transmitted to the 
first floor. 

I remember how I hailed with joy 
this limited supply of steam heat, as it 
helped to dissipate the tomb-like damp- 
ness that pervades an English home 
from November to March. 

Think what all these open fire-places 
mean in the way of extra workl Coal 
supply must be carried to the different 
rooms; the various fire-places must be 
cleaned out every morning; the hearth 
weU brushed and the brasses polished. 

The absence of heating apparatus 
also means that the bath room is prac- 
tically useless for washing purposes in 
cold weather: therefore hot and cold 
water must be brought to the bed rooms. 
Every morning, about 8.30, the house- 
maids can be seen toiling over the stairs 
with large brass pitchers of water, which 
are deposited in due time in the various 
bed rooms. 

Breakfast is never served before 9 
o'clock. If you have been accustomed 
to breakfast at 8 o'clock, you may ex- 



pect, when that hotu" arrives, to be 
assailed by pangs of hunger; and you 
are tempted to make remarks (sotto 
voce) about these English methods. 
Presently, your wrath is softened by 
the entrance of a housemaid with what 
is known as " the early morning tea." 
This consists of a cup of tea and a thin 
slice of bread and butter. 

Being thus fortified, your spirits * 
revive, and you are able to proceed with 
the morning toilet, which is made with 
as much expedition as your ntmibed 
fingers will-permit. 

Then you hasten to the breakfast 
room, the only place in the house where 
there is any heat, and proceed to thaw 
yourself before the open fire. The 
family hurry in, one after another, all 
more or less in a shivering condition. 
If you are wise, you will refrain from 
any remarks about their method of 
heating houses; for you will be told 
very quickly, with an air of finality, that 
warm houses are very unhealthy. 

You will note from the spic and 
span condition of the rooms that the 
morning work of tidying up has been 
completed dtuing the two hours that 
have intervened between the servants* 
rising, at 7 o'clock, and the serving of 
breakfast, at 9 o'clock. This accounts 
for the fact that you never see a servant 
with a broom in her hand. By what 
species of magic, I queried, is this house- 
hold machinery kept in motion? Is it 
oiled by fairy hands or are there secret 
springs? With a grim determination 
to discover if possible what this motive 
power was, I began my investigation. 

After carefully collecting the evidence 
at hand, I reached this conclusion. The 
women who go out to service in England 
have better qualifications for the making 
of a good servant than the domestics

in this country. Here is one place that 
the class distinction in the old country 
has a beneficial side. People expect to 
stay put in the station of life into which 
they have been bom. It is not an un- 
common thing to find servants who have 
remained in the same family for a 
dozen years. The line of demaracation 
between mistress and maid being clearly 
drawn, it is easy to define the require- 
ments of each station, and a clearer 
understanding of their respective duties 
is the result. 

The next discovery I made was that 
the amount of work required from one 
domestic in America is divided among 
three in England. Do I hear the 
American housewife who is paying a 
general housework girl from five dollars 
to six dollars a week exclaim — ** How 
can they afford it? '* The reason that 
they can afford it is because the wages 
are so low on the other side. The aver- 
age wages of an English domestic is 
sixty dollars per year, about five dollars 
a month. Now, this permits of having 
three servants for the same monetary 
outlay that secures one in an American 
home. The cook may command as 
much as two and a half dollars per week. 
She sometimes has a helper who gets 
from fifty cents to one dollar The 
cook's work is very much simplified by 
having no hot breads to prepare for 
breakfast. As a matter of fact, little 
or no bread of any kind whatever is 
prepared in an English home. The 
baker supplies this article of consumption. 

The English breakfast is a much 
simpler thing than ours, consisting, 
generally, of toast and tea with a little 
bacon. When they have a cereal, it is 
oat meal, or porridge as they call it. 
Fruit is so expensive that it is regarded 
as a luxury that comparatively few 
households can afford. 

I was very much impressed with the 
manner in which the mistress of the 
house relieved the second girl from at- 
tendance on table at the morning meal. 
The food is brought in, placed_on_the 



table in covered dishes, and the maid 
disappears, not to be seen again during 
the meal. The bread is always put on 
in loaf form. It often stands on the 
sideboard; and I have seen the yoimg 
men of the family go and cut a slice 
for the guest, when he was ready for a 
second helping. Contrast this with the 
American home, when one maid is often 
required to prepare various hot dishes 
for breakfast and then is expected to 
bring in the different courses and serve 
them. 

If it is Monday, the washing is staring 
her in the face. The washing is always 
sent out in England, so that " blue 
Monday " is imknown there. The 
work of every servant is clearly defined 
and no mistress would think of asking 
a servant to do anything that is not 
within her province. 

It is part of the second girl's work 
to wait upon the mistress in the capacity 
of lady's maid. She must also do the 
mending of the men of the home. 

On Sunday, the maids go to the morn- 
ing service, in their ttun, but all have the 
privilege or going to the evening service, 
which takes place at 6.30. 

Afternoon tea is served at 5 o'clock 
on Sunday, and supper from 8.30 to 
9 o'clock. This gives the servants time 
to get back from church and prepare the 
evem'ng meal. 

I happened to reach an English home, 
where I was about to make a visit, on 
the eve of a bank holiday. These bank 
holidays occiu" four times a year. The 
shops are closed from Saturday until 
Tuesday, so that working people may 
have a week's end of three days. My 
hostess explained that it was her custom 
to arrange for each of her servants in 
their turn to have an outing on these 
bank holidays. She procured time- 
tables, selected the best trains and paid 
all the expenses of the outing. She re- 
marked quite casually, "this is the 
cook's turn, so we will have to put up 
with the second girl's cooking for a few 
days." She did not apologize, she 



ENGLISH AND AMERICAN HOMES 



517 



simply explained conditions. 

There was no nervous trepidation 
about what I was to have to eat. What 
the family had was supposed to be good 
enough for me. How different from an 
American household, where the advent 
of company acts an as alarm signal, 
every member of the family bombarding 
the new comer with attention until he 
might well ask to be delivered from his 
friends. 

In an English home, the guest is 
allowed to come and go as he pleases. 
With the exception of placing an extra 
plate at table, there is no evidence of 
an addition to the family circle. Isn't 
this after all the essence of true hos- 
pitality — a willingness to share that 
which is our own in the daily life without 
straining after* ostentatious display? 
The evident pleasure they take in dis- 
pensing hospitality is the best proof 
that they get genuine enjoyment them- 
selves in the entertainment of their 
friends. 

I remember once having been invited 
by a newly married American friend 
to make one of a little dinner party at 
her home. She kept but one maid, and 
yet she had planned a ten-course dinner. 
This meant that much of the work 

« 

devolved upon herself. She was so 
wearied by her efforts that, when she 
sat down to the dinner table, she looked 
positively ill. 

In England there would have been 
three servants preparing and serving 
a much less elaborate meal, and the 
hostess could have had a fund of energy 
reserved for the entertainment of her 
guests. 

Is not this mistaken effort to overdo 
things at the root of the servant pro- 
blem in America? A very intelligent 
English lady once asked me to tell 
her what would be required of one 
servant in America; and I proceeded 
ro enumerate what we demanded of a 
general-housework girl. Her face be- 
trayed so much surprise that I hast- 
ened to say — "But we pay a servant 



three times as much wages as you would 
pay her!" "That doesn't give her an- 
other hand or foot," she pertinently 
replied. 

Notwithstanding all our modem ap- 
pliances for making housework easy, 
the fact remains that both mistress and 
maid have a very laborious task run- 
ning our household machinery. What 
is the remedy? We must first learn 
to eliminate certain things from the 
daily needs; a simplified method of 
living would result in better digestion 
and less expenditure of nerve force. 
Then a little more consideration of the 
limitations of one servant would help 
the matter. 

The golden rule should be applied 
here as elsewhere. An intelligent mis- 
tress ought not to expect the raw emi- 
grant without any educational training 
to act with her judgment. There is 
the same gap between them that exists 
between the teacher and the pupil in 
a school; but she forgets this because 
the servant is grown-up. The child is 
easier to manage because she goes to 
school to learn, but the servant covers 
her ignorance by an audacious pertness, 
with which it is often difficult to be 
patient. She has been led to believe 
that . she was emigrating to an El Dor- 
ado and so she has no scruples in de- 
manding high wages for inefficient ser- 
vice. She does not reckon with the 
fact that the average American woman 
has enough of the commercial spirit to 
demand full value for the wages she 
pays. If this raw product could only 
be turned over, on landing, to a school 
of domestic science, where she would be 
taught for a year, free of charge, what 
constitutes efficient household service, 
we would be nearer to solving the prob- 
lem that is .racking the nerves of our 
women and driving them to seek relief 
in the Apartment House Caf6. 

Cannot some philanthropist, who has 
at heart the preservation of the Amer- 
ican home, do something to^improve 
this condition of things? Suppose we

had a free School of Domestic Science! 
After the gold bug had been operated 
upon and eliminated, there might be a 
kind of clinic, open to housekeepers, 
where they could study the proper treat- 
ment of stubborn cases under skilled 
direction. 
All thinking people feel that the pre- 



servation of the home is a vital question 
in our national life. After one has 
experienced the peaceful serenity of the 
family life in England, she returns to 
our scenes of turmoil, asking herself 
this question — "What can be done to 
recover our lost prestige as home mak- 
res?"

Placing the Family Pride 

By Eleanor Robbins Wilson 



IN that delectable bit of character 
portrayed from the pen of Kate 
Douglas Wiggin, where poor, well- 
meaning Mrs. Ruggles imparts her 
memorable lesson in manners to the 
nine impatient Ruggleses, preparatory 
to *' the dinner at the great house," 
you remember how the cream of the 
whole proceeding came to the top in the 
fond mother's parting injunction — 
*' 'n whatever you do, all of yer, never 
forgit for one second that yer mother 
was a McGrill." 

It is, indeed, funny. But human na- 
ture and family pride is parceled out in 
the most unexpected places. 

To be proud of one's family is un- 
questionably commendable, but to have 
the support of the family name handed 
to us so often that we get to lean upon 



it as sort of moral crutch is an utterly 
deplorable condition of affairs. 

One of the most worthless whiffets 
I know is a victim of this form of family 
priditis. A new acquaintance simply 
cannot talk to him for any length of 
time without being informed that his 

mother is of the old southern L s. 

And no opportunity escapes him to 
ciury favor with his father's eminent 
respectability. Even in the small mat- 
ter of ordering theatre tickets by tele- 
phone, it is his custom to introduce 

himself as the son of , the 

broker. His family tree may be 



a credit to him, but he doesn't seem to 
realize what a tent caterpillar stunt he 
is doing on his branch of it. 

Sir Overbury must have had such as 
he in mind when he said, — " The man 



PLACING THE FAMILY PRIDE 



519 



who has not anything to boast of but 
his illustrious ancestors is like a potato — 
the only good belonging to him is under- 
ground/' 

Perhaps there is no more prevalent 
mistake we mothers make than in 
always serving family pride in the past 
tense. It is all very well to tell,occasion- 
ally,what a brilliant General grandfather 
J was, what a sparkling conver- 
sationalist grandma Q- was, and 

how high father ranked in college, but 
the inevitable outcome of an overdose 
of this kind results either in the child 
comparing himself unfavorably with 
his ancestors to his own belittlement 
or else it leads to the swell-headed idea 
that the family tree is full-grown and 
will completely shelter any shady work 
which he contemplates doing. 

The ideal parental attitude, in this 
respect, is one which calls for the bal- 
anced viewpoint. While restraining 
green memories of the good deeds of 
ancestors and calling attention to them, 
advisedly, it will also strive to keep 
fresh, with encouraging oversight, to- 
day's ambitions of each developing 
child. It will not fail to inspire the 
growing boy with the knowledge that 
he, here and now, is a bearer of the 
family banner, that he must face toward 
victory and accomplish greater achieve- 
ments than did his forebears. It will 
not fail to instil in the mind of the 
budding girl that she is an instrument 
of expression, to grace her present en- 
vironment in a superior manner. Early 
will it take cognizance of the unfolding 
personality and help the possessor to 
build constructively, and in so doing 
a judicious amount of praise, approba- 
tion and encouragement will be found 
,to be the parents' biggest mental levers 
to lift ambition. 

Johnny there, wrestling with his 
mathematical problems, is building the 
strength of great reasoning powers. 
Our greatest service is to see that he 
believes in himself. Mary here, daily 
struggling with the complexities of her 



music, is creating tomorrow's genius, — 
let us not allow her to languish for want 
of vision. They are lifting newly budded 
branches to the fructifjring powers of 
modernity. Let us speed the promising 
evidence of such talent with the warmth 
of parental approval. Heredity surges 
to fresh flower in Johnny's and Mary's 
individualities. Let us tell them so, 
bearing in mind that,— 

Some approbation now and then 
Works wonders with our little men: 
And words of praise from lips held 

dear 
Have often changed a girl's career. 

Make the child feel that he is guardian 
of today's destiny, that a man rises no 
higher than his ideals, and that no one 
amounts to any more than his actions. 
Sustaining ourselves with the theory 
that, if we want satisfactory results, the 
pathway of youthftd endeavor must not 
be made too easy. It was perseverance 
that made plastic the hard conditions 
that confronted grandfather, and per- 
severance still retains a Midas-like 
touch. 

You recollect the story of Ney, one 
of Napoleon's famous marshals. At a 
banquet during the Russian campaign, 
a brilliant woman had been telling of 
her wonderful ancestry, when suddenly 
she inquired: " By the way, Marshal 
Ney, who were your ancestors? " 

" Madam," replied Ney, *' I, myself, 
am an ancestor." 

When a man feels so proud of his 
ancestry that he hesitates to bring dis- 
honor upon them, it indeed forms a good 
moral checkrein. But it is a wise man 
who knows how to bridle his vanities, 
and most or us have occasional need of 
a common-sense martingale, when we 
feel called upon to parade our lineage. 

Yes, family pride is the one thing we 
never bury. Let us chase it out of the 
cemetery — rehabilitate it, and bring it 
a living, pulsing presence, to be nurtured 
and garmented anew at the hands of 
today's boys and girls. 



The Value of Diet Fads 

By Jessamine Chapman Williams 



SURELY yet, perhaps, unconsciously 
the general public has been re- 
ceiving great benefit from the 
scores of modem diet fads that have 
sprung up in the last decade or two. 
We may not be initiated Vegetarians, 
Fletcherites, Pasters, No-breakfast Fad- 
dists, Raw Food Advocates or Low 
Protein Scientists, but we have been 
influenced more or less by these diet 
reformers, though we stoutly deny 
membership in any one of these schools. 
We look at these diet faddists and shake 
our heads pityingly, but they, in turn, 
go on working out their own salvations 
from terrible dietetic troubles, indiges- 
tion, gout and ntmiberless other dis- 
eases. 

The majority of people are not willing 
to enjoy their food as Horace Fletcher 
bids them do. A cube of bread held 
in the mouth as long as possible may 
taste like candy, finally, with all the 
starch changed to sugar, but few of 
us have the patience to procure our 
candy that way. We are too fond of 
short cuts even in our pleasures. The 
public will not all become Fletcherites, 
but it may become semi-followers of 
his cause, because it has had its eye 
opened to the sound physiological prin- 
ciple of salivary digestion involved 
underneath the exaggeration of this 
and allied theories. The volume that 
has been written about American rush 
and hurry and its injurious effects 
has touched all phases of our lives. 
Horace Fletcher attempts a reform 
of one phase, namely, our hurried man- 
ner of firing the human machine. If 
we aren't willing to give an hour to 
the constmiption of a meal, we may 
agree to spend half that time, which 
is infinitely better than the former ten 
minutes. The pubUc has been in- 



fluenced to use greater care in the masti- 
cation of food and Fletcher deserves 
our gratitude for his service. 

While Fletcherism may be one method 
of correcting our dietetic errors, another 
holds up to us fasting as the only way 
to eradicate our troubles. We are 
told to go six or eight days without 
food when suffering from dietetic dis- 
orders, then gradually come back to 
a restricted diet, beginning with a 
few spoonfuls of milk and increasing 
the quantity until the digestive appara- 
tus is able to take care of the average 
amount of food again. The theory 
is that the digestive system, like an 
engine, has been clogged by dinkers. 
and needs a rest and a chance to be 
cleaned out and oiled up. No fuel 
must be given it until it has been re- 
paired; it must not even run on half 
time. Few people are ready to adopt 
such strenuous measures to correct any 
dietetic error and even prefer the dis- 
ease to the cure. Yet, this theory of 
fasting has created interest and dis- 
cussion to the extent that less food is 
advocated as a relief for many of our 
common aches and pains. The belief 
is now that we are overfed rather than 
underfed. 

In line with the fasting theory is the 
No-Breakfast Fad. The man who ate 
a hearty breakfast of fried potatoes, 
sausage and fat gravy, buckwheat cakes, 
butter and maple syrup, coffee with 
cream and sugar may now be an advo- 
cate of the no-breakfast plan and feel 
rejuvenated. These are the extremes 
of the case. However, the Americans* 
idea of breakfast is changing and becom- 
ing more like the continental breakfast — 
a roll and weak tea or coffee — or a 
light cereal and fruit substituted for 
the former three course breakfast of 



520 



THE VALUE OF DIET PADS 



521 



fruit, cereal, meat, eggs, hot breads 
and coffee. The public will always 
act as a balance. The custom for 
generations of taking breakfast will 
not be overturned completely, but it 
will be modified with changed conditions 
of life. Few advocate no breakfast; 
all will agree to lighten it. 

The attempt of Prof. Chittenden to 
prove a great waste of protein and total 
amotmt of energy in otir food consump- 
tion has been a true benefit to the world. 
The statement that a person may live 
on half the amount of nitrogen given 
by other authorities, without loss of 
body weight and with improved health, 
has created world-wide interest and 
brought investigations along the same 
lines. Prof. Chittenden's experiment 
with United States soldiers gave con-, 
elusions from body weight alone which 
can only be extremely rough. The 
majority of scientists and therefore 
the average layman hesitates to adopt 
seriously for the remainder of life a 
diet as low in protein and total energy 
as Prof. Chittenden't standard, but 
many agree to a compromise, splitting 
the difference between 50 grams and 
125 gfams of protein daily and feeling 
there is safety in such. By so doing, 
the terrible evils resultant from over- 
taxing the organs of elimination, — gout, 
rheumatism, diabetes, obesity and all 
the kidney diseases may possibly be 
overcome, and no * enfeebling of our 
bodies, physically or mentally, can result 
from the half way standpoint taken. 
Here again the general public is the 
balance wheel in its slowness to adopt 
extremes, yet reaping the real benefit 
by taking the middle ground. 

No doubt that the patient and untir- 
ing investigations regarding the meta- 
bolism of purins has led a few to adopt 
a strict non-purin diet, — no meat or 
anything much, but the "hay*' in our 
diet. Until the public has definite 
proof of its ruin, it will continue to 
cater somewhat to its natural appetites 
regarding piuins; it will continue to 



exercise common sense; strike a happy 
mean in their use, and go on living 
cheerfully. 

Just where the Vegetarian theory 
belongs for any sort of discussion is 
hard to determine. If the consistent 
vegetarian makes the question a moral 
one — the shedding of any blood a 
down-right crime — the matter is one 
of ethics and not of science. One may 
believe anything he chooses. No one 
has ever doubted the fact that life 
can be supported on a strict vegetarian 
diet, — and also on a strict animal diet. 
This, history has proved often enough. 
That our modem dietetic evils can be 
corrected in other ways than by adopt- 
ing vegetarianism is obvious. The pub- 
lic will adopt neither extreme exclusively, 
but use the theories of vegetarians to 
teach a common-sense lesson — a wise 
and judicious mixture of the two classes 
of food. 

There are various modifications or 
restrictions in vegetarianism. A few 
well-preserved, healthy-appearing indi- 
viduals rise up now and then claiming 
their health and happiness to be due 
to a diet of fruit and nuts alone. Most 
of us believe that they have health 
in spite of this erratic diet. To be 
sure a balanced diet can be obtained, 
using these foods alone, but it requires 
more thought and study to get the 
necessary tissue-building and energy 
requirement than the average person 
will undertake, and all for what! The 
advocates on an exclusive fruit-and-nut 
diet have given us valuable suggestions, 
however, for using fruits and nuts 
in our menus to a greater extent, 
thus correcting some evils, — a lack 
of mineral salts, of cellulose, and per- 
haps too much meat. The obsese and 
•certain dyspeptics who have turned 
to the **grape cure" for relief from their 
ills were not benefitted by the grapes 
they ate as much as by the necessary 
exercise involved in gathering the grapes. 
The average working man doesn't need 
a grape cure, but to the gouty million- 



522 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



aire it may have a real value. 

One general cry (perhaps it has 
originated with too busy housekeepers) 
has been that we spend far too much 
time and thought in the cooking of 
food. Why spend hours in cooking 
a dinner when we can enjoy equally 
well a meal of raw foods — a cube or 
two of nutose or a similar compoimd 
equal to a pound of beefsteak, a saucer 
of raw grains finely ground, a bean 
biscuit or two baked in the sun, and a 
handful of oily nuts and some fruit. 
Such a diet would certainly prevent 
our spending much thought on our food, 
and our time might be free for other 
things than cooking. But what of 
our digestion? ''Flavor is to the man 
what oil is to the machinery of an 
engine.'* Without flavor as a stimu- 
lant to the fl^ow of digestive juices, 
digestion is upset. The bran of grains 
can hardly be said to possess much 
flavor. But the Raw Food Club has 
benefitted the public by warning it 
of the danger of becoming too epicurean 
in its tastes and advocating one phase 
of simpler living. 

Why not adopt as a simpler diet still, 
a milk diet, and take two or three 
quarts a day to give the necessary 
food value? Nature has provided this 
food for the infant. Why not for 
the man? Its ease of digestion and 
absorption makes it valuable for the 
weakest digestive apparatus. But the 
majority of people never would accept 
this diet and there is a reason for 
their refusal. A milk diet contains 
too much protein in proportion to the 
carbohydrates and fats for an adult, 
but this property renders it most desir- 
able for the growing child. It also 
lacks iron for the adult, while the 
quantity proves sufficient for the in-» 
fant who starts life with an extra 
supply of iron stored in the liver. 

The advocators of an exclusive milk 
diet have succeeded thus far in a diet 
reform. They have shown the pubhc 
that milk for the adult even, is a food 



and not a drink to be poiu'ed down 
as water, with the same amount of 
food besides. A glass of milk is more 
than equal to an egg in heat and energy. 
The business man may cheerfully choose 
a lunch of bread and milk, in preference 
to meat and potatoes, and find he 
is as well nourished. 

There are adherents to a salt-free 
diet, and to diets without other con- 
diments and spices. Their belief is 
that we use condiments to cover up 
the real flavor of food and to disguise 
tainted food; that they irritate the 
delicate lining of our digestive tract, 
interfere with the natural flavor of 
digestive juices and are "heating to 
the blood.'* Blame is often put upon 
the poor spices used in French cooking, 
while if should rest upon the putrefy- 
ing or stale foods used in the compli- 
cated mixtures. If spices are heating 
to the blood, why do people living in 
the tropics use them so freely and 
actually crave them? Woods Hutchin- 
son explains this by the fact that 
they are excellent antiseptics, pre- 
venting putrefaction and fermentation 
of food in the digestive track and hence 
of great value in the tropics where 
foods spoil so easily. 

That refreshing, innocent, salad vege- 
table — the tomato — was once con- 
sidered absolutely poisonous, and even 
now is believed by some to cause can- 
cer and aggravate rheumatism. Pork, 
including ham and bacon, because of 
its slowness of digestion, has been 
put to the very bottom of the list 
of digestibilities. As a matter of fact 
slowness in digestion is not synony- 
mous with indigestion and the dys- 
pepsia experienced is often due to 
the mixture we put with the pork. 
It isn't the pork that makes one shake 
the head when "pork and beans" 
are mentioned. It is the toxic prin- 
ciple hidden in the protein of the bean 
that is the offender, while the poor 
pork is only an observer of the trouble, 
as Woods Hutchinson says. 



THE VALUE OF DIET FADS 



523 



The public has been deluged with 
breakfast foods, health foods, predi- 
gested and patent foods. Their food 
value has been praised to the skies 
and some people have become suscepti- 
ble to their pretentious charms. All 
of us wotdd needs be expert food-chem- 
ists, physiologists, doctors and diete- 
tians to be able to weed out the few 
that are good from the host of bad. 
The safest rule to adopt, in judging, is 
to remember that no plain, whole- 
some untampered-with food requires 
advertising. It is only those whose 
virtues are doubtful that have to be 
urged upon the public. The plain 
cereal grains from which the host of 
breakfast foods are made contain all 
the food properties of the manufactured 
cereals and are infinitely cheaper and 
safer than after their passage through 
the secret maneuvers of the cereal 
and healthfood manufacturer. 

Why take our phosporous and casein 
in the form of "Sanatogen," or our 
bicarbonate, of soda and caseins in 
"Plasmon" or **Nutrose*' or our am- 
monium casein in "Eucasein", when 
we can get these in plain milk at one- 
tenth the cost? Why not take our 
iron, phosporous, and other salts in 
the form most completely absorbed, — 
namely, in the organic combinations 
found in our foods? The very pro- 
duction of these patented foods has 
acted as a warning to the public. As a 
resxilt, pure food laws have been evolved 
and the secrets of these concoctions 
exposed. For the normal, healthy in- 



dividual the whole category of patented, 
predigested, and all health foods can 
be swept away as useless; for the patho- 
logical condition of the digestive organs, 
let the physician prescribe. Disastrous 
results of experimenting blindly have 
been warnings to us. 

No one diet system or fad will ever 
supercede our natiu'al instincts com- 
pletely. One and all of these fads have 
acted, however, as checks and guides 
to our natural instincts and in such 
capacities have been of real value in 
keeping a balance. 

With the warnings received from 
the no-breakfast and the fasting" fad- 
dist we will use more discretion ^per- 
haps in the quantity of food we are 
consuming. With Horace Fletcher, to 
continually remind us of the errors 
of bolting our food and the benefits 
received from chewing patiently until 
each mouthfxil is swallowed involun- 
tarily, we may overcome one of the 
evils of our American life — its ever- 
lasting rush. With the evils of exces- 
sive meat eating shown us by vegetarians 
and the low protein and non-purin diet 
advocates it is possible that the meat- 
three-times-a-day habit may become 
a more sensible one — a diet of meat 
once a day. The fruit and nut and 
raw food faddists are teaching us a 
lesson in simplicity of living. Thus, 
while we may not be initiated members 
of some diet reform, we are reaping 
the real benefits of all and go on liv- 
ing cheerfully with our eyes opened by 
the diet extremist.

A Side Light on the High Cost of Living 



By Alice M. Chalmers 



WHAT have you planned for des- 
sert tonight, Betty?" asked 
the thrifty housewife, as her 
daughter-in-law came into the kitchen 
carrying fat, laughing, two-year-old 
Bobby, pink and warm from his bath. 

"Oh, some jello with bananas and 
nuts will be nice I guess," laughed 
Betty, tumbling Bobby into his buggy 
and pushing back the curls from her 
pretty, flushed face. 

**But," protested the thrifty house- 
ivife, ** jello is so expensive with fruit 
and nuts, and I notice there is some 
stale bread in the pantry that I might 
just as well as not use in a nice bread 
pudding." Betty had thought that same 
bread wotdd make croutons for the soup 
that night, but mother had come for 
a visit from the farm and had only been 
in town a few days, so she called back 
gaily as she wheeled Bobby into the 
simny bay window, "All right mother, 
just make anything you Hke." 

"Dear, dear!" sighed the thrifty one, 
"how extravagant some people are. 
That comes of taking one's housework 
so lightly." 

That night at dinner the bread pud- 
ding made its appearance. The thrifty 
housewife explained how easy it was 
to save little things in simple ways. 

"What's in the scrap bag, mother," 
inquired the man, better known as Bob- 
by's dad, catching his wife's laughing 
eye. 

"There are two eggs, — I only use 
two," she explained proudly, "a little 
milk, some raisins, sugar, cinnamon, and 
the bread, and you see it makes a nice 
economical dessert." 

"Let me see," the man answered 
gravely, "how much milk and raisins 
mother?" 

"Just a mite of milk, about a quart. 



and half a box of raisins." 

"Two eggs," the man continued, "at 
seventy five cents a dozen — say twelve 
cents — a half-box of raisins, five cents 
— a quart of milk, ten cents — sugar, 
cinnamon, and the rest — surely not less 
than three cents, that's thirty cents, at 
least. Not such a cheap pudding, is it 
mother?" 

"Thirty cents!" exclaimed the thrifty 
housewife blankly, "but," her face 
brightening, "you must remember, we 
had all the things in the house and it 
was such a shame to waste that bread." 

The man laughed, Betty thought witli 
glee of the expensive jello, while Bobb>' 
in his high chair smiled wisely, as if 
forseeing the improvements which his 
generation would 'no doubt be respon- 
sible for. 

And so it must always be. There 
will always remain remnants of past 
customs and ideas handed down and 
kept, because habit is so hard to break, 
even when one knows a better way. 
There is yet abroad not a little of the 
so-called economy which consists of pre- 
paring every little part of all food at home, 
when it is an open secret that it can be 
obtained already prepared, cheaper and 
more wholesome. There is another fal- 
lacy called economy which consists of 
"using everything up," when the using 
really means a larger expenditure and 
smaller returns. The only real economy 
is in no waste and the greatest possible 
value for money expended. There is 
no economy in using thrity cents worth 
of ingredients to dispose of three cents 
worth of bread, unless the product of 
such combination be especially desirable. 

The old idea of making things at home, 
regardless of cost, nutritive value, or 
anything else, because it is extravagant 
to buy canned or otherwise prepared

A SIDE LIGHT ON THE HIGH COST OP LIVING.

food, should surely be obsolete now, 
but facts hardly point that way. In- 
stead, there are a large number of women 
yet who insist that such things repre- 
sent the ultimatum of waste and shif t- 
lessness. One woman with a family of 
three actually shuddered when I sug- 
gested that Campbeirs tomato soup 
was the most nourishing and economical 
of soups. She declared that people now- 
a-days thought of nothing but saving 
work. She always opened a can of 
tomatoes, made a white sauce, and then 
stood over it while it thickened, watch- 
ing it carefully to see that it did not 
curdle. When finished, the soup cost, 
at lowest estimate, as much as the other 
and contained no stock, thereby de- 
creasing its food- value; and beside all 
this her family preferred the other! 

In a similar way I have heard all 
prepared foods rejected. "Canned to- 
mato sauce! Mercy, what next?" I 
heard one disgusted woman say in a 
little town grocery, as she scornfully 
rejected the five-cent can of sauce, and 
went out the door with a neighbor, com- 
plaining to her of the high cost of living 
and her own overworked condition, all 
in the same breath. 

Women who make griddle cakes for 
breakfast often pass by the prepared 
flour, which costs perhaps five cents a 
meal for cakes, and stand beating eggs, 
at five cents a piece, for the cakes which 
their families confide to each other on 
the sly aren't half so good as Aunt 
Jemima's. The poor woman must need 
get up fifteen minutes earlier in the 
morning and be fifteen minutes more 
tired at night, but see how worth while 
it is, when they can do all the cooking 
and not be the victims of absurd, new- 
fangled ideas! 

One woman I know, living in Cali- 
fornia where there is almost always an 



abundance of fresh fruit, decided she 
must make jelly. She had all she could 
do without this extra work, but you see 
she had made up her mind. When she 
had finished her jelly-making, I just 
counted the cost. The jelly had cost 
her, as near as I cotdd estimate, eleven 
cents a glass, while in the stores delicious 
products of the same flavors could be 
purchased for ten! Of course she con- 
tended that it was impossible for the 
other to be as good as hers, and only 
after I had slipped a glass of it in with 
hers and she had used it without detect- 
ing the difference, would she admit 
that perhaps the wholesaler was able 
to make- things cheaper than the little 
individual manufacturer. 

There are long, long lists of things 
which save time and money, because 
they do away with waste and give the 
greatest returns for the money expended. 
Besides the soups, fruits and sauces, 
there is the canned pumpkin, which 
costs one-fourth the time and effort 
that the whole pimipkin did, when one 
is making the popular pumpkin pie; 
there is good mince meat which serves 
the same purpoes that ones own does 
and pleases the family just as well. 
Komlet, at twenty five cents a can, goes 
much further than com and eliminates 
the tedious operation of putting com 
through a colander for the soup. A 
thousand and one things there are, all 
designed to save time and money, for 
the big factory works more economically 
than the little house. Must then this 
march of progress pass by and leave un- 
touched the self-cfidled conservative wo- 
man, who, overworked and with no 
leisiu'e for study or enjoyment, reject- 
ing the short cuts and clinging to her 
false standards of economy, raises in- 
stead of lowers the cost of living? Let 
us keep informed of modem processes.

ENCOURAGEMENT 

IN no way can our subscribers man- 
ifest their appreciation and encour- 
agement, and really aid us so much, as 
in renewing their subscriptions promptly 
dtiring the month in which it expires. 
The conditions of publication are such, 
at present, that all subscriptions to 
periodicals must be paid in advance, 
and all renewals must be made practi- 
cally at the date of the expiring sub- 
scription. 

We are just in receipt of a letter 
from a lady who says, "My subscrip- 
tion to the Cooking-School Magazine 
expires this month and I am renewing 
it, as I do not wish to miss a number of 
the journal. To make sure, I might 
as well accept your general offer and 



enclose three dollars to renew for four 
years." We are always glad to comply 
with requests like this, for it eb'minates 
a great deal of both extra work and 
expense. Our method is to win out 
by avoiding all unnecessary waste and 
expense, and to use every available 
resoiu"ce in improving the quality of 
our publication. 

Like other publishers, we are anxious 
to retain our old subscribers as well as 
to secure new ones. We are equally 
anxious to avoid annoying them by 
frequent and undue solicitations to re- 
new. 

Kindly, then, renew promptly by 
use of the formal blank provided you 
for this purpose. We propose to give 
you in each issue full measiu"e of the 
best and most helpful material we can 
possibly procure. We are making pre- 
paration to enlarge the scope and useful- 
ness of the magazine. 

CHEERFULNESS 

THE cheerful habit is an asset for 
any one, and the want of it 
may be a liability. A good laugh is 
better than a doctor's tonic. Cheerful, 
hopeful people invite rather than repel 
the confidence of others. The cheerful 
home is always the source of wholesome, 
inspiring influences. 

A chief condition of cheerfulness, it 
seems, is good health. Hence the desir- 
ability of guarding well and building up 
by every means this main source of our 
wellbeing. Today in the home, the 
school, and other meeting-places, san- 
itary ways are considered of far greater 
importance than ever in the past. The 
modem school-house is built on quite 
different plans than the old red school- 
house of fifty years ago. Epidemics 
and disorders are traced to their sotirces 
and these are destroyed or removed. 
It follows, that the remedy of most ills 
is educational in nature. Reforms are 
brought about by spreading knowledge 
abroad. "Ye shall know the truth, and 
the truth shall make you free." 



EDITORIALS 



527 



Another condition of cheerful living 
is a bit of prosperity in our daily occupa- 
tion or calling. These who achieve 
success are known to be active, almost 
restless, in the pursuit of chosen enter- 
prises. To energize is to be happy; 
and long continued, earnest concen- 
tration of eflEort is sure to bring fitting 
reward. An air of prosperity makes 
any spot attractive; it alone insures the 
happy home and renders life tolerable. 
We can await opportunities for improve- 
ment, but thriftiness and sure good lies 
in the way of doing with our might the 
"work that is nearest at hand. Of pros- 
perity some one has said: 

"When farmers are making money; 
when factories are getting a fair return 
for their commodities; when railroads 
receive a just return for the one thing 
they have to sell, that is transportation; 
when the iron-mills have orders ahead, 
and rails are being produced at a profit, 
then we are all prosperous.'* 

Breath deep, exercise freely, be dil- 
igent in business and keep cheerful. 

FADS AND FANCIES 

THIS journal never caters to sensa- 
sational fads and fancies. It holds 
no patent right on manufactured food- 
stuffs; nor does it claim to have insti- 
tuted any great reforms in household 
management. It aims simply .to aid 
the average housekeeper in making the 
most of conditions as they now are, 
with a view always to making gains or 
betterments. 

Occasionally we are criticised, un- 
justly we think, for giving too much 
attention to fancy dishes; and yet in sea- 
son and out we are constantly inculcating 
and insisting on the desirability of 
knowing how to manipulate the plainest 
bills of fare. For plain living, we think, 
conduces to economy, thrift, health and 
longevity. 

Some housewives seem desirous to 
live at the least possible expense; others 
to do the least possible amount of work; 
still othets are insistently seeking for 



something new, something a little out 
of the ordinary, for the table. Each of 
these clasess represents a rather difficult 
proposition, in these days. The exer- 
cise of individual taste and choice is the 
great prerogative of us all. 

Our purpose is to neglect or pass by 
nothing that can be of interest or useful- 
ness to our readers. Experience teaches 
us, however, that nothing really good 
can be done in any situation without a 
proper expenditure of time, labor, even 
hard work, and, oftentimes, money. 
In culinary and household matters, 
especially, time and labor often are 
productive of better results than those 
that are gained by the lavish use of 
money. Here, as elsewhere, thought 
and effort are essential to the best 
achievement 

''EFFICIENCY''— FOR WHAT? 

EVERY day has its pet word — 
and to-day's is * 'efficiency." For 
some time past the educational journals 
and the educational conventions have 
made efficiency their key-note. Even 
the New England Association of Col- 
leges and Preparatory Schools gave 
the main session of its last meeting 
to addresses on measuring efficiency. 

In the mill-room and the machine 
shop, efficiency is a clean cut idea. 
It is defined as sharply as velocity or 
friction. It means the ratio of result 
to effort, of accomplishment to energy 
expended. It is a merit of machines 
and machine-like operators. 

But in all our talk of efficiency as 
the aim of education, as the measure 
of a man's worth, as the test of social 
ways and means, the enlarged meaning 
we give the term is not clean cut; it 
eludes definition. It blurs the engineer's 
idea — the ratio of work performed 
to energy consumed — with untech- 
nical ideas older than Solomon and his 
proverbs. In fact, oiu: recent outcry 
for efficiency is due, one-tenth, to what 
efficiency means, and, nine-tenths, to 
less formal virtues confounded with it.

THE BOSTON COOKING^CHOOL MAGAZINE 



Whatever may ' be true in applied 
mechanics, we ought to see that in 
homes and schools and in all places 
where men's rights and duties coimt 
for more than guages and meters and 
time-keepers' sheets, we can never sat- 
isfy ourselves with mere efficiency. 
Of course, teachers must show their 
pupils how to study to best effect, 
and domestic scientists must show 
incipient housekeepers how to save 
their motions and materials. But the 
real leaders of thought, the guides of 
public opinion, ought now to fix for 
us more urgently than ever those aims 
on which our efficiency should tell. 
For while efficiency, so far as under- 
stood, is a stirring cry, yet broad out- 
looks on truth, appreciations of art 
and nature, friendly affections for one's 
kind, a steady will to serve many people, 
these are surer means of satisfaction 
than all the records at piecework, sales- 
manship and business organization. 

It takes a wise man to distinguish 
ideas that tell how things should be 
done from ideas that teU what things 
are worth the doing. Many of our 
educators would do well to see that 
of all ideas that recommend a manner, 
efficiency is probably the most formal 
and empty. — The Herald. 

A GIRL'S PHILOSOPHY. 

WHETHER one believes or not in 
a deity, it is always safe to trust 
in the power of Good. Good is the 
positive force that rules the imi verse; 
and, no matter how many million years 
may be consumed in the process of 
reaching it, the tendency of everything 
is toward the Best. 

Evil is negative, the misuse of the 
power for good with which man is en- 
dowed. It is misplaced force, as dirt 
is misplaced matter. If it acts as a 
hindrance to progress, it is eventually 
overcome. It is the duty of every 
man to join forces with the Good. Small 
as any one may be, he can do his share 
of the work of betterment. Each man's 



share is the best that he can make of 
his life. 

A life is made up of deeds, as time 
is made up of fractions of seconds. 
Deeds are the outcome of thoughts; 
each act is the direct consequence of 
a motive. If we keep our thoughts 
good, our minds will habitually give 
rise to good motives and so to good 
deeds. 

The attitude of heart that keeps 
otir minds in the most ideal condition 
is the attitude of love — towards every- 
body and everything. The action that 
is prompted by love will prove to be 
the kind action, the most beneficent 
in result. When evil seems to us to 
follow an act meant in kindness, it is 
because our eyes are not far-seeing 
enough, — our minds not sharply enough 
trained in our faith — to discern the 
actual result. 

Even though we may not be per- 
mitted this view of remote consequences, 
we may rest assured that, with some 
good in ever)rthing, the better the motive 
the greater the ultimate gain to the 
individual, the race, the world, and 
the infinitude beyond. So, then, we 
can guage our actions by the unselfish- 
ness of the motives that prompt them. 
Should we chance to forget and fall 
away from the principle, when we 
come back to it, as we needs must, it 
will be found unchanged and ready 
for us. 

If the world seems sordid, sometimes, 
and our eyes tire of straining toward 
so high a goal, we find that the cul- 
tivation of that spirit of love relieves 
the strain, and the world is made 
brighter for us and for all men. 

This faith, held to, is fatal to "moods" 
and the "blues", to petty annoyances 
and disappointments. The man who 
can say, whatever happens, "It is all 
for the best," is the bravest man, the 
happiest man. 

Contentment is the "Treasure of 
Life". The price of it is Love.

When getting the supper Monday 
night, set the oatmeal to cook for the 
brealrfast Tuesday morning; let cook 
half an hour or longer. Put the dates 
into a saucepan. If the potatoes are 
to be baked, scrub and wipe them dry; 
if they are to be boiled, pare, quarter 
and set aside, covered with cold water. 

Tuesday morning has now come and 
the tea kettle is boiling. Add a little 
boiling water to the oatmeal and fill 
the lower kettle to the proper height 
with boiling water and set to cook for 
the second time. Before serving beat 
the oatmeal thoroughly. 



Pour boiling water over the dates; 
heat quickly to the boiling point and 
skim from the water to an agate plate; 
set the dates into the oven to dry off; 
then cut on one side and remove the 
seeds; serve a few in the saucers with the 
oatmeal. The dates furnish a natural 
sweet and, with them, sugar is more 
than ever a superfluity with cereal. 

K one is f orttmate enough to have a 
choice cotmtry ham, a slice cut directly 
from the raw ham may be broiled over 
not too fierce coals, or pan-broiled 
in a hot frying pan, or even carefully 
fried, and prove a toothsome breakfast 
dish. But with knowledge bom of 
past experience we suggest, that the 
broiled ham be cut from near the 
center of a carefully "boiled" ham. 
Leave the ridge of fat on the slice, 
brush over the lean part with melted 
ham or bacon fat, set the slice in a 
double broiler over the coals, but not 
too near them, turn often, and dispose 
on a hot platter as soon as heated 
throughout. 

If baking is the method of cooking 
chosen for the potatoes, pick out small 
ones that will bake in half an hour; 
cut two gashes across the top of each 
potato, one at right angles to the other, 
take each potato in a cloth and crush a 
little on the bottom, to let out steam 
and disclose the pulp; set a generous 
piece of butter in the center of each

and if agreeable fleck, with paprika. 
These should not be removed from the 
oven and made ready until after the 
cereal has been served. If the potatoes 
are to be boiled, set them to cook in 
boiling, salted water and let them cook 
quickly. If time is no object, do not 
cut them in pieces until time to cook. 

As the milk toast is made partic- 
ularly for the children of the family, 
the sauce should be made in a hygienic 
manner. Scald one cup and a half of 
milk in a double boiler; gradually stir 
half a cup of milk into one-fourth a cup 
of sifted floiu- and half a teaspoonful 
of salt, then dilute with a little of the 
hot milk,, and when well mixed stir into 
the rest of the hot milk; continue to 
stir until the sauce thickens, then cover 
and let cook about twenty minutes. 
When ready to serve, beat in one or 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, a little 
at a time; have ready the graham bread 
well dried out and browned, dip the 
edges in boiling, salted water, then 
cover with some of the hot sauce. 
Divide the work of getting breakfast, 
if no maid is employed, among the 
different members of the family and let 
each be responsible for serving a dish, 
hot and in good condition, at just the 
right moment in the sequence of the 
breakfast. 

For the fish dish at dinner, select 
whatever fresh fish is available in your 
locality. Pickerel, black bass, lake fish 
of good size, or halibut, haddock, cod, 
sea bass or sea trout from the ocean 
are all adapted to this mode of cooking. 
With halibut, select two slices, cut en- 
tirely across the fish, below the body 
opening. For any of the other kinds, 
a whole fish is needed, and the fillets 
or flesh on each side of the back bone 
should be taken off as entire as possible. 
This will give two large pieces of solid 
fish. This work can be done at the 
market, but with a little experience it 
can be done at home in a very few min- 
utes. Cover the head, bones and all 
the trimmings with cold water, add 



an onion cut in slices, three or four 
slices of carrot and three branches of 
parsley and let cook half an hour to 
make stock for the sauce. Take the 
cover of a tin cracker box and pound 
the edge flat, rub it over with fat salt 
pork and set into a baking dish; on this 
set one of the prepared fillets and sprin- 
kle lightly with salt. Mix one cup of 
soft, fine bread crumbs, one-fourth a 
teaspoonful, each, of salt, pepper, and 
powdered sweet basil, and if desired a 
tablespoonful of fine-chopped onion or 
green pepper, or both, and, lastly, one- 
fourth a cup of melted butter; spread 
this over the fish in the pan, lay the 
second piece of fish over the dressing 
and press it down upon it, then set two 
or three small pieces of fat salt pork 
above the fish. Cook in a moderate 
oven about forty minutes, less ratlier 
than more. Baste four times while 
cooking with the fat in the pan or a 
little melted butter. When nearly baked 
spread half a cup of cracker crumbs, 
mixed with two or three tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, over the top of the 
fish and return to the oven to brown 
the crumbs. When ready to serve, lift 
the tin with a board spatula and care- 
fully push and slide the fish on to a hot 
serving dish. Have the mashed potatoes 
hot and ready to serve when the fish 
is ready. To insure this put thepotatoes 
over the fire just after the fish is set 
into the oven. The fish stock for the 
drawn butter sauce should be strained 
and set to cool before the fish is put 
into the oven. 

When the fish is rather more than 
half -cooked, begin the sauce. Melt three 
tablespoonfuls of butter; in it cook 
one-fourth a cup of sifted flotir and 
half a teaspoonful of salt; then stir 
in two cups of the fish broth; stir until 
smooth and boiling. Cover and set 
over boiling water. When the fish is 
on the platter, stir into the sauce two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, in little bits, 
beat in a teaspoonful of lemon juice 
and the sauce is ready. 



THREE MEALS A DAY

The cabbage will need to cook three- 
quarters of an hour; early in the morn- 
ing cut it in eighths, remove the hard 
center and let stand in cold water 
until time to cook. Cook in boiling 
water; add salt just before the cabbage 
is done. Use a large quantity of water 
and leave the saucepan uncovered. 
When cooked the cabbage should not 
have lost its crispness; drain carefully 
and serve on a folded napkin. The 
sauce for the fish will suffice for the 
cabbage. The recipe for the dessert, 
which can be made early in the morning, 
is given on another page, in the Season- 
able Recipes. 

The cheese dish for supper may be 
made in the morning and simply re- 
heated at night. For this dish scald 
one cup and a third of milk in a double 
boiler; mix one-fourth a cup, each, of 
flour and cornstarch and half a tea- 
spoonful, each, of salt and paprika 
with two-thirds a cup of cold milk, 
and stir into the hot milk; continue to 
stir until the mixture thickens, then 
cover and let cook twenty minutes, 
stirring occasionally. Beat one-fourth 
a cup of butter to a cream, beat in two 
yolks of eggs, one after another, then 
half a cup (generous measure), of grated 
cheese; stir this into the hot mixttue; 



continue to stir until the egg is "set", 
then turn the mixttire into a shallow 
dish to form a sheet about half an 
inch thick. When cold cut into squares, 
diamonds or rounds. Butter an au gratin 
dish suitable for the table; in it dispose 
a layer of the cheese shapes; sprinkle 
with grated cheese and set a layer of 
paste over the cheese and sprinkle 
generously with cheese. A half to a 
full cup of cheese may be used. Ten 
or fifteen minutes before supper is 
served, set the dish into the oven to 
reheat the paste and melt the cheese. 
Serve with this the salad, and bread and 
butter. For the salad make about a 
pint of tomato jelly; stir it in ice and 
water imtil it begins to set, then add 
a cup or more of fine-cut, cooked vege- 
tables, string beans, asparagus-tips, 
peas, bits of celery, capersj one or 
several, as is convenient. In making 
the dressing allow a tablespoonful of 
oil and a scant half-teaspoonf ul of vine- 
gar for each service, also a scraping of 
onion juice and a few grains, each, of 
salt and paprika. The prunes, soaked 
over night and cooked in the morning, 
should be simmered very slowly; thus 
cooked, the sweetness of the prunes is 
brought out and but little if any sugar 
is needed. 



Frost Fairies 



While sleep did make for mortal eyes a screen, 
They soft descended to their witchery, 
Veiling with dazzling white the russet lea, 
Coating the streams with ice-mail, till I ween 
They flashed forth silver in their crystal sheen; 
And on the panes what fleecy land-scapes, see 
What ferns and frost-flowers, side of tropic tree, 
In frigid art out-rivalling Nature's green. 

O, fairy alchemists of unknown craft! 
Distilling pearl-paint from the frosty air, 
Hardening diamonds in a single night 
Long Earthward with your matchless genius 

waft. 
And when December's scenes grow dull and 

bare, 
Hold us with studies done in peerless white!

Making the Boarding-House a Business 

By Anna Green 



TWO years ago, I was confronted 
with the problem o£ earning an 
income sufficient to educate and 
provide a living for my two young 
sisters who were then in high school. 
Our dear old home was all that was left 
to us after the change in our fortunes. 
To part with that would break our 
hearts. I did not want to go down 
town to seek employment, nor did I 
feel capable of doing any hne of spec- 
ialized work. Besides, it seemed best 
for me to be at home so that when the 
girls came from school there would be 
some one to look after them. After 
hearing several friends complain of the 
meals at their boarding-houses, I felt 
I had found the solution of my problems. 
Why not serve good homey meals to 
the people who longed for them? Cook- 
ing had always been a pleasure. We 
had all the capital required for the 
business. 

After making further inquiries,! found 
that the average price for good table 
board in this middle western community 
is four and one half dollars per week. 
I also learned that there were many 
women who depended year after year 
on the boarding-house for their food. 
Most of them are earning good salaries 
at sedentary occupations. To them, 
good food is a necessity, if they are to 
maintain a high standard of efficiency 
in their various fields of labor. Many 
men also prefer a meal in a home to one 
in a restaurant, but will patronize the 



latter rather than do business with the 
average woman who runs a boarding- 
house. If I put the time, effort, and 
intelligence into the business that I 
would in working for some firm or cor- 
poration, why could I not make it pay? 
I determined to try and stuck to my 
decision even after hearing the adverse 
criticisms of my friends. 

In making my plans, every point 
was considered to save time, labor, and 
material. Every economy was practiced 
which would decrease the running ex- 
penses and still not lower the standard 
of the meals I served. There would 
be the very best posable meals for the 
price To do this much help was out 
of the question. So all the furniture 
and equipment of our dining-room, 
pantry, and kitchen was arranged to 
save labor. Our one thought was to 
use our heads to save our heels. 

Our house had a door opening from 
the front porch Into the Hving-room. 
The boarders, or as I prefer to call them, 
my family use this for an entrance. 
The living-room is cheerful and home- 
like and is made more so when there 
is a bright fire in the grate on chilly 
mornings. The desk and telephone are 
conveniently placed and the morning 
and evening papers are always on the 
table. 

The walls of the dining-room were 
rather dingy, so we had it decorated. 
We chose a cheap, soft tan paper, but 
the color and design were good, jast

what the room needed with its brown 
wood work and southern exposure. 
We made new curtains of scrim, which 
latmder easily and do not hide the 
pretty view from the windows. The 
plate-rail came down to stay, and its 
sundry collection was disposed of in other 
parts of the house. Three good pictures 
were hung. Every article not actu- 
ally in use was taken from the side- 
board. The copper percolator and tray 
gave a bright touch to the room. A 
fern-dish filled with feathery ferns is 
always kept ready for a centerpiece 
when nothing better is at hand. On the 
floor were placed matting rugs in tones 
of brown to match the walls. 

The refrigerator and supplies were 
kept in the pantry, and dessert and 
salads were prepared here. Two shelves 
were kept for this purpose. We still 
cling to this method. All the salad 
and dessert plates, ice cups, et cetera, 
are placed there. All dishes that need 
warming are kept in the kitchen cup- 
board, the silver, glasses, and other 
dishes in the dining-room. A wooden 
box fastened outside the pantry window 
saves the ice bill considerably. 

The kitchen walls are painted and 
the floor covered with linoleum. I do 
not consider this an ideal floor covering, 
because the dirt does get in between 
the strips and tmder the edges, but it 
is the best for us in otu* kitchen, because 
the hard wood flooring is very poorly 
laid. The flour bin, sugar, flavorings, 
etc., with the pans used for baking are 
arranged in one section of the cup- 
board. When I bake, I draw my table 
up beside it and everything is within 
reach and can easily be put away. 
All the kitchen utensils in constant 
use are hung on hooks placed as conven- 
iently as possible. For instance, the 
paring knife is kept in a holder above 
the sink. No extra steps need be taken. 

After two years experience, I find 
it cheaper to buy my supplies in large 
quantities. A woman from the cotmtry 
supplies me with' butter and eggs, and, 



through her, I have found farmers who 
supply me with my fall vegetables. 
We buy enough carrots, beets, cabbages, 
and potatoes to last most of the winter 
and store them in the cellar. By buy- 
ing canned vegetables and fruits from 
the wholesale grocery in the fall, we 
get them more cheaply. Soap, sugar, 
and coffee are also bought at wholesale 
rates. 

When we opened, we had five people, 
but it was not long before we had 
twenty, as many as I care to serve. 
I keep accounts carefully. The grocer 
and butcher send slips with each order 
and these are kept on a spindle until 
checked up. I have a card file on which 
to record all my expenses and orders. 
Every day I enter the cost of groceries 
meats, and milk, on their separate cards, 
so that at the end of the month it is 
an easy task to add them. It is fun 
to compare one month with another, 
when you can place two cards side by 
side to do it. I keep posted on the 
market prices and plan so far as possible 
to serve things in their season. Any 
money spent on other parts of the house, 
not caused by "the business" are en- 
tered as personal expenses. I have one 
helper to whom I pay six dollars per 
week with her living. The table linen 
and dish towels are sent to the laundry. 
At first, we tried having it done at home, 
but we found that it did not pay. 

The meals are planned for a week 
at a time, being arranged to use up 
left-over meats. We use these as skil- 
fully as possible. Never are Sunday 
left overs served on Monday, but by 
Tuesday noon they may be disguised 
and served with impunity. By com- 
paring the menus with those of the 
previous week, we never get into a 
routine. As fast as a recipe which 
serves twenty is worked out, it is filed 
so that when the dish is repeated there 
will be none wasted. I study the likes 
and dislikes of my family and never 
serve any one what they do not eat, if 
it can be avoided. A dab of something

which otherwise might not be used will 
replace the food, and the psychological 
effect is very pleasant. The family 
feel they are being cared for and that 
their boarding house is not a machine 
passing out their food with rythmic 
regularity. As the people I serve are 
leading sedentary occupations, the meals 
are light and well balanced and an 
excess of protein is avoided. 

The noonday meal costs much thought, 
but little money. We make them as 
dainty and attractive as possible, so 
that they refresh the mind as well as 
the body. Soups, salads, and hot breads 
with marmalades are favorites. Noth- 
ing is ever served that is sloppy with 
gravy running all over the plate. 

We rise at six o'clock. The maid 
and I start breakfast, and, after fixing 
the furnace, one of the girls dusts and 
the other starts the grate fire Then 
they both set the table. Before we 
invested in a cart we put the glasses 
and silver, after being washed, in a 
market basket, because they were so 
easy to carry into the dining-room. 
The cereal is started the night before 
and placed in the fireless cooker. The 
grape-fruit also is prepared the night 
before. While getting breakfast, we 
have Itmch and dinner in mind and use 
all ^pare moments in getting vegetables 
or fruits ready. Canned vegetables 
have a better flavor, if they are opened, 
poured into another dish and aerated 
before they are cooked. Lettuce is 
bought by the crate. It is washed, 
put in a crock, and covered with a damp 
cloth. It will keep crisp in a cold 
place for several days. Breakfast is 
served from seven to seven forty-five, 
so that by eight o'clock the dining-room 
is usually empty. 

The dining-room is swept and put 
in order and then we wash the dishes. 
We have wire racks for most of them, 
so that by plunging them into very hot 
water and setting them aside to drain, 
they do not need to be dried. While 
the maid is tending to the rest of the 



house, I do my ordering or go out to 
market. Then comes the baking. We 
bake nearly all our own bread and all 
the cake and pie we use. While this 
is going on, the preparations for the 
evening dinner are under way. If the 
dessert is to be an ice, the syrup is made 
and the fruit juice prepared. The 
meat or fish is fixed or, at least, the pans 
are made ready. When the dishes are 
washed after lunch and the dining-room 
and kitchen put in order, we are free 
until five o'clock. Of course this is 
not always true, but usually we manage 
it. 

After a complete rest for an hour, I 
usually spend an hour at my desk 
working over accounts and planning 
work for the next day. Then I go 
somewhere for a walk, if the weather is 
good. One afternoon, I let accounts 
go and run away for a while. If I 
can't do this, I open my window and 
take deep breaths, going back to my 
work with renewed vigor. To be able 
to relax, with one's mind at ease, is a 
wonderful boon to any housekeeper.- 

At dinner, I preside at the head of 
the table and one of my sisters at the 
foot. Some of the guests have asked 
to be allowed to dish things, so we have 
a homelike atmosphere. Once or twice 
during the week we have candles on the 
table. They are not expensive and give 
a festive air. As I wear simple wash 
dresses, I leave my apron in the kitchen 
and I am ready to greet them, although 
sometimes my face is pretty flushed 
and my nose shiny. As hostess, I can 
lead the conversation into topics of 
mutual interest and avoid gossip. In 
this way I keep in touch with the outside 
world. The discussions become very 
lively and interesting. 

But the important question is — 
does it pay ? I can honestly reply that 
it does, for all expenses are met and there 
is still enough left to give me a salary and 
pay an interest on our capital invested. 
We consider our home, equipment, and 
dishes as capital. Of course it is hard

work, but it is work that requires intel- 
ligence. I feel I have grown both 
mentally and physically in the past two 
years. There are times of discourage- 
ment, but when I see my happy family, 
I feel that I am doing more than earning 



a living, I am actuaUy contributing to 
the physical well being of twenty indi- 
viduals. Are my boarders satisfied? 
I think they are. Only two have left 
us, and then not from dissatisfaction, 
and I have a long waiting list. 



What a European Trip May Teach a Mother 



By Elsie S. Eells 



ARTISTS, musicians, writers, 
teachers, all gain inspiration 
for their work in the old world. 
Mothers, too, may at least find food for 
thought in foreign travel. Much may 
be learned by observing the methods 
the mothers of other nations use in 
training their children. 

Let one just notice the children one 
sees at the railway stations and in the 
trains as one travels in England and 
on the continent. Compare them with 
the children one sees when one travels 
in America. In America the child is, 
almost without exception, the center 
of the group of admiring relatives and 
friends who accompany his family to 
the station to bid them farewell or come 
to welcome them upon their arrival. 
AH eyes, including those of his parents, 
are focused upon him. What wiU the 
little dear do or say next? The answer 
to this question is awaited with breath- 
less interest. Not so in Europe. How 
different the attitude' There the child 
is treated as a side issue and the grown- 
ups occupy the center of the stage. One 
soon sees why it is that the people of 
other lands accuse the American child 
of not knowing his place. It is not the 
American child's fault that he expects 
to be the center of interest. He has 
been trained to it from his babyhood. 
Are there not advantages in character 
building to be gained from the European 
method? The thoughtful mother may 
well ponder over the problem. 



In hotels and restaurants one has the 
opportimity to observe the table manners 
of other children, even if one is not 
privileged to enter more intimately into 
foreign family life. The chief reason 
that the small English child eats more 
gracefully than the little American is 
that Americans use their forks as shov- 
els, as the English accuse us of doing. 
**Tines down" is the rule for forks in 
England. This rule is growing more 
common in America and it should be 
practiced in all homes where there are 
small boys to train. It is impossible 
to overload a fork, held "tines down" 
to such an extent as one held with the 
tines up. Overcrowding the mouth 
is the worst fault in table etiquette 
among American small boys and adopt- 
ing the English method overcomes it 
at once. The *' tines down'* rule for 
forks is followed in all other civilized 
lands much more than in America. I 
was at first amused to notice that, in 
English homes, when the child left 
something uneaten upon his plate, he 
always said to his mother or to the 
hostess, ** Please excuse me if I leave 
this upon my plate." I never spoke 
of it to an English mother, but it evi- 
dently is taught to the children that it 
is a breach of etiquette to leave morsels 
of food upon one's plate. A child's 
eyes are, proverbially, * 'larger than his 
stomach" and does not the English 
method give him good training in 
accurate judgment?

Germany can teach the American 
mother much concerning fanfiily life. 
In the outdoor refreshment garden, 
which one finds everywhere in Germany, 
it is interesting to watch the family 
groups. The children are not left at 
home with the servants or a grandmother, 
but share their parents pleasures. Far 
too often in America the father takes 
his recreation one way, the mother 
another, and the children, as many dif- 
ferent ways as there are children. May 
we not well follow the example of 
the Germans and bind our families 
more closely together by sharing our 
pleasures? One frequently sees a fam- 
ily tramping party. The father and 
mother each carry a knapsack and each 
of the children carries one suited to his 
size. Are there not American families 
who would find benefit and enjoyment 
in such a vacation? The German fam- 
ily surely thrives by such a method. 
Boy Scout tramping parties are good, 
but are they equal to the family tramp- 
ing party? The German child is not 
only taught to enjoy a wholesome out- 
of-door life in the company of his 
parents and under their influence, but 
he is also taught a wholesome respect 
for law. We may admire the border of 
fruit trees which lines every German 
roadside and wish that such a system 
could be established in America, that 
wholesome fruit might thereby become 
cheaper and more plentiful. Would 
not the guardians of such fruit have 
a far more difficult time, however, in 
America, in warding off the deprada- 
tions of small boys ? The workingman's 



garden at the outskirts of the town would 
bring better food supplies to the Amer- 
ican as well as to the Gennan working- 
man, but would not the produce be 
stolen, or, as we say, * 'swiped?'' Amer- 
ica is the land of liberty, but is it not 
in danger of becoming a land of law- 
lessness ? Each American mother should 
teach her child obedience and respect 
for those in authority. These old- 
fashioned virtues are in danger of falling 
into disrepute in otu* land. Travel 
in Germany brings home this truth. 

As an American mother, it is en- 
couraging to say that the most badly 
behaved child I ever saw in my life, 
was seen in Germany. I have seen 
many badly behaved children in Amer- 
ica, but never one quite equal to the 
'One in Germany, the land of law and 
order. He was five years old and 
his parents were trying the theory of 
letting his yotmg character develop 
according to nature. The result was 
that his baby sister screamed with 
terror when he approached her, and 
the dogs and cats hastened out of 
his way with all possible speed. He 
called his grandmother all sorts of 
vile names. The epithets he applied 
to her and to the servants are untrans- 
latable. When I spoke of him to an 
American friend, I was reminded that 
corporal punishment still prevails in 
the German schools, and after the 
schools there is the army. Perhaps 
there is hope of his becoming a law- 
abiding citizen after all. Anyway it 
is cheering to know that not all naughty 
children Uve in America. 



Saint Valentine 



The good old saint, who plods through drifting 
(; snow. 

When February's winds pipe loud, pipe low, 
Comes laden with his gifts so quaint, so dear. 
And 'tis his mission, rare, to bless and cheer. 



He wakens tender hopes, and visions start. 
He sets to pulsing every quiet heart. 
And like the springtime, tells each waiting one — 
"Rejoice, for see, the world is glad and young!"

The Poultry of Old Neptune 
By Josephine Wright. 

SINCE the high cost of poultry 
has made of it a luxury, no sub- 
stitute has been accepted with 
the favor that is accorded tuna, the 
turkey of the ocean. Its flaky white 
meat, in appearance and flavor very 
like the breast-meat of turkey, may be 
used to advantage in nearly ^ recipes 
calling for the meat of poultry. It is 
eaten and enjoyed by many who dis- 
like other fish in any form. It is being 
canned and sent into the interior where 
its sale is rivaling that of salmon. 

One of the most popular methods 
of experimentation in things culinary 
is in the making of sandwiches. 

Tuna Sandwiches 

1 cup fiaked tuna, Bhp- I 1 teaspoon lemon juice 
chopped 1 teaspoon, each, tar- 

2 teaspoons creamed ragon, chervil, gher- 
butter I kins 

Put into a bowl and blend lightly, 
adding a dash of paprika and one of 
nutmeg, before spreading the mixture 
on very thin white bread. A paste bet- 
ter suited for dark bread sandwiches 
may be made as follows: 



3 hard-boiled eggs 
2 tablespoons butter 
\ teaspoon dry mustard 



i cup tuna 
1 teaspoon chopped 
capers 



Make a paste of the fish and the yolks 
of the eggs. Chop the whites very fine 
and add with all other ingredients. If 
the paste seems dry, add a little vine- 
gar and sweet oil. 



Tuna Souffle 

2 tablespoons butter j j cup milk 

3 tablespoons dour 1 cup tuna 
t teaspoon salt 3 eggs 
Cayenne | 

Melt the butter in cooking dish; add 
flour, seasoning and mix thoroughly. 
Add milk, stirring constantly until sauce 
is thick and smooth. Remove to asbes- 
tos mat and add well-beaten yolks and 
tuna. Cool, Add stiff-beaten whites, 
turn into a buttered baking-dish and 
bake for half an hour in a hot oven. 
Eat at once. 

Tuna Toast 
6 blocks dry bread I \ cup Hollandaise 
2 cups flaked tuna | 1 tablespoon butter 

Cut the center from each block of 
bread, leaving a thin layer on the bot- 
tom. Sautfi the bread-cups thus made 
in butter. Heat the tuna in the Hol- 
landaise and serve in the hot crisp 
toast. Garnish with parsely. 

Tuna Loaf 
1 cup bread crumbs I 1 egg 
1 cup flaked tuna Salt and pepper 

1 cup sweet milk | Onion juice 

Beat the eggs until it is light. Put 
all the ingredients into a bowl and mix 
well. Press the mixture into a but- 
tered loaf -pan and bake twenty-five min- 
utes. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs 
and serve with drawn butter. 

Drawn Butter for Tuna Loap 
1 cup hot water j 1 tablespoon flour 
\ cup butter 1 tablesooon lemon 

Salt and pepper | juice 

Melt butter and add flour, Add

gradually all other ingredients. Bring 
to a boil. 



Tuna in Peppers 

1 cup sweet milk 
6 bell peppers 
Salt and butter 



I 



2 cups tuna 

1 cup bread crumbs 

4 eg£s 

Cut the peppers in halves, lengthwise. 
Remove the seeds and put peppers to 
soak in very cold water. Beat the eggs 
slightly and add the milk, the tunja, 
bread crumbs and seasoning. Pack the 
mixture into the peppers and sprinkle 
over the top bread crumbs and a little 
butter. Brown in the oven and eat hot. 

Tuna Salad 

3 cups tuna 1 1 cup thick mayonnaise 

1 cup diced celery J cup French dressing 

1 hard-boiled egg ! i cup chooped olives 

1 green pepper, shredded | 

If this salad be properly made, it will 
prove more delicious than the most in- 
viting chicken salad. Several hours 
before it is to be served, mix the tuna, 
celery, chopped egg and green pepper 
lightly together, adding the French dres- 
sing gradually. Just before serving add 
the chopped olives and toss lightly 
again. Put it into its salad bowl and 
arrange the thick mayonnaise over the 
top. 

Chop Suey with Tuna 



' the pan. Beat in the eggs, one at a 
time. Drop the mixtiire onto buttered 
paper in long fingers. Bake in a mod- 
erate over until thoroughly done. When 
cold, split open with a sharp knife, put 
a spoonful of tuna salad into each cache 
and replace the top. 

Tuna in Shells 



1 lb. fresh pork 
1 cup tuna» flaked 
I cup diced celery 
1 cup chopped onions 



1 cup chopped peanuts 
1 can mushrooms 
1 tablespoonf ul butter 
Salt and pepper 



Put the butter into a deep iron fry- 
ing-pan. Saut6 the pork, celery and 
onions. Cut the pork into small pieces. 
Cover with a cup of water, the mush- 
rooms and the liquor from them. Boil 
slowly for an hour. Add peanuts,tuna 
and seasoning and cook half an hour 
longer. 

Tuna Cache 



1 quart tuna salad 
i cup butter 



1 cap flour 
4 eggs 



Put the butter into the water and 
bring to a boil. Beat the flour into this 
and take from the fire. Stir this^ dough 
until it no longer sticks to the sides of 



2 cups flaked tuna 
4 eggs 

3 tablespoons butter 



} cup cream 
1 lemon (juice) 
Salt and pepper 



Parmesan cheese 

Hard cook two of the eggs. Cream 
the butter and rub into it the yolks. 
Add now, in the order given — lemon 
juice, salt and pepper, tima, chopped 
whites, cream and two beaten eggs. 
Mix well and turn into buttered baking- 
shells. Cover with Parmesan cheese and 
brown in the oven. 

It must be remembered, in the fore- 
going recipes, that the flaked tuna is 
the meat as it comes prepared in cans 
Of coiu*se, if the fresh fish be used, it 
must be cooked. 

In some of the recipes salmon may 
be subsitiuted with success, but not in 
all. Tuna is free from the oily, fishy 
taste that salmon has and might be 
undesirable in some of the dishes. 



A New Way to Cook Eggs 

A FRIEND long resident in France 
and familar with the various ome- 
lets and soufil6s made there recently 
tried an experiment in her American 
home, which proved a marked success. 
It is a dish of- eggs resembling both 
baked omelet and a souf96. She takes 
fresh eggs and breaks them together, 
adding a tablespoonful of cold water 
for every two eggs, a little salt and 
some rather fine-chopped parsley. This 
combination is whisked a very little, 
perhaps, about six times, and poured 
into a buttered agate dish. For six 
eggs she uses one about the size of a 
large coffee saucer. This she places low 
over the burners of her gas oven, light- 
ing two btimers after she has put the

dish in. As soon as the eggs have 
risen well up to the top of the high 
dish, turn off one burner, and as soon as 
weU set, turn off the other, leaving the 
eggs in a few minutes longer. They 
must not remain over twenty minutes at 
the most, and often fifteen will be 
enough, depending upon the flow of 
gas. 

The lower crust is tender, not firm, 
and the center is flaky, neither like 
scrambled eggj — nor is it wholly like 
omelet. 

The parsley gives it a good taste; 
pepper may be added, also, with the salt, 
and red pepper, for those who Uke it, 
mixed with either white or black pep- 
per. 

Also, one may add a chopped red or 
green sweet pepper, some onion, or 
chives; or rub the bowl in which the 
eggs were beaten with garlic. Sweet 
herbs may be used according to taste; 
and since families and persons vary so 
much in their likes and dislikes no set 
combinations are given. 

Chervil mixed with the parsley is 
nice, and sweet basil, summer savory, 
thyme, etc., may be used. 

To make a sweet course for a lunch- 
eon, add some candied cherries and 
make a sauce of the liquid to serve at 
the table. Add sugar to sweeten, if 
desired, or sprinkle the top with sugar 
and score with a hot iron in the foreign 
and old-fashioned way, if desired, but 
the crust of this dish on top is very 
attractive. 

Potato Cups Instead of Timbales 

Oftentimes, for one's family or the 
sudden arrival of friends to luncheon, 
there is sudden consternation as to 
"What we can fix quickly that is attrac- 
tive?" 

Should there be large potatoes on 
hand, cut these in halves or thirds to 
make cups; pare them, of course, and 
cut off ends so they will stand. All 
pieces cut out of the centres for cups, 



or from the ends, need not be wasted. 
Boil in salted water. Take any bits 
of cold vegetable, such as peas or cauil- 
flower, and make a rich cream sauce. 
Use this for filling the potato cups. 
A little "goes further*' and looks more 
attractive this way. A mixture of veg- 
etables may be made, such as one buys 
in the foreign macedoines and Ameri- 
can combinations of ten or more; lima 
beans, string beans, pease, carrot, tur- 
nip or kohl rabi, etc. 

Garnish with celery leaves, parsley 
or watercress, if possible.

New Ideas for St. Valentine's Day 

THE revival of the celebration of 
St. Valentine's day, with its quaint 
old customs, has given an opportu- 
nity for girls to use bright and original 
ideas in giving luncheons and other 
social festivities. 

One young hostess, who entertained 
a girls' embroidery club at luncheon, 
prepared for each guest a valentine, 
which was a square card, with a hand- 
painted cupid or a cluster of rosebuds 
for decoration, and an original verse. 
These cards were enclosed in envelopes 
bearing the names of the guests and 
laid on the table to designate the places. 

Another girl, who was away from 
home, sent to a group of her girl friends 
love tokens which she had made her- 
self. These were simply sheets of heavy 
writing paper, with original verses, and 
tiny cupids and hearts, cut from red 
paper in silhouettes and pasted on 
irregularly as a border. 

One young woman, who was in col- 
lege and often homesick, was delighted 
when she received a number of Val- 
entine postals from her home town. 
These were sent by her high school 
chtmis and each one bore an original 
verse or pretty quotation suitable for 
the fourteenth of February.

Potted Cheese 

We have had no experience in potting 
cheese. One might try the following 
method, with a very small quantity and 
see how it worked. Press the cheese, 
while soft, into an earthen or glass jar; 
use a pestle in putting the cheese into 
the jar, that no small air space be left; 
pour on melted butter or other choice 
fat to the depth of half an inch; cover 
with a stout cloth, tying it on close. 
Store in a cool place of even temperature.

the pointed end, and cut in thin slices. 
Serve, also, cold with salad; or cut in 
cubes, in cream sauce; or with potatoes, 
green peppers, and bacon £is hash. 

Dressing for Stuffed Heart 

Mix one cup of soft bread crumbs, 
one-third a cup of butter and one-fourth 
a teaspoonful. each, of salt, black pepper 
and thyme. 

Baked Tripe, Spanish Style 

Boil four pounds of fresh tripe until 
tender; drain and sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and arrange in a well-buttered 
dish. Potu* over it one quart of chopped 
tomatoes, one large onion, sliced very 
thin, one-half a cup of chopped parsley, 
skin of one large red pepper, minced 
fine, one-half a cup of chopped olives 
and one teaspoonful of Tabasco sauce. 
Pour over all one-half a cup of melted 
butter, and bake one hour. 

Broiled Tripe with Bacon Rolls 

Simmer fresh tripe in boiling water 
until very tender (it will take five or six 
hours of cooking); add salt during the 
last of the cooking. Drain, and set 
aside in a covered dish until ready to 
use. Brush over the portion to be used 
(honeycomb tripe is considered the best) 
with partly melted butter or bacon fat, 
and set to cook over the coals or under 
the gas burner. Let cook three or four 
minutes, then remove to a hot platter, 
season with a little salt, if needed, and 
spread over the top as many slices of 
broiled bacon as there are individuals 
to serve. Bacon rolls may replace the 
broiled bacon. To prepare these, run 
a toothpick through each slice of bacon, 
rolled up like a jelly roll, immerse all 
at once (in a basket) in hot, deep fat, 
let cook a minute, then drain, and use 
as specified. A quarter of a lemon 
should accompany each portion. 



Crab meat may be served in cream 
Sauce or tomato sauce; in the form of 
timbales, soufflfe, mousse, mousselines, 
salad or croquettes. We have given it 
in these pages, deviled, in shells and 
au gratin; it has also appeared as crab 
flake mousse. For the latter dish use 
the recipe given in this issue for Ham 
Mousse and serve with HoUandaise 
sauce. For soufflfe use the recipe for 
Ham Souffl6. 

Grab Meat Timbales 

Chop fine one solid cup of crab meat, 
beat into it four eggs, one after another, 
then three-fourths a teaspoonfvd of salt 
and one pint of cream; beat in the cream 
gradually. Butter about one dozen 
small molds and fill with the mixture- 
Set the molds on many folds of paper 
in a baking dish and surround with 
boiling water; let cook, without boiling 
the water, in the oven, tmtil firm in the 
center. It will take about twenty min- 
utes. Serve, unmolded, with HoUan- 
daise or drawn butter sauce.

Query 2132. — "Kindly give simple recipes 
for cooking rabbits, inclndiug among them 
"Hasenpfeffer" Style. Rabbits are reasonable 
in price and as some of my family eat no red 
meat, rabbits make an agreeable change. 

Larded Rabbit Baked with Milk 

One rabbit will serve from four to 
six people. Cut off the head on a 
line with the shoulder bones. Remove 
the rib bones and as many layers of 
skin from the outside as is possible. 
Cut off the feet and scrape the flesh 
from as many tendons as are in sight, 
discarding the tendons. Wash in sev- 
eral waters, then wipe dry. Lard the 
whole upper surface with pork lardoons 
or, to save time, spread over the rabbit 
in the pan thin slices of larding pork. 
Set into a hot oven, baste, at first, 
with the fat in the pan, then lower 
the heat and baste with hot milk; 
dredge with flour after each basting. 
Let cook from one hour to one hour 
and a half, or imtil tender. Melt one- 
fourth a cup of butter; in it cook one- 
fourth a cup of flour, half a teaspoonful, 
each, of salt and paprika, then add 
one-fourth a cup of cold milk and the 
milk drained from the baking pan. 
Dispose the rabbit on a hot dish. Set 
aroimd it from foiu* to six cup-shaped, 
rice croquettes, each holding a tea- 
spoonful of currant jelly; between the 
croquettes set rolls of bacon, fried in 
deep fat or cooked in the oven. Rim 
a wooden toothpick through each roll, 
to hold it in shape while baking. Serve 
the sauce in a bowl. 

Rabbit a la Marengo 



Separate a carefully washed-and-dried 
rabbit into eight pieces, four legs and 
four body pieces. Discard rib bones 
and all tendons possible. Season the 
pieces with pepper and salt and roll 
in flour. Heat equal parts (about 
three tablespoonfuls, each), of clarified 
butter and olive oil in a fr3ring pan; 
put in the joint of rabbit and let cook, 
turning when needed, to a golden brown. 
Drain the fat from the pan, add one- 
fourth a cup of Sauteme and let this 
reduce. Heat three tablespoonfuls of 
fat from the pan, stir in three table- 
spoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful 
of salt and one-fourth of pepper, then 
add three-fourths a cup, each, of tomato 
purfe and rich brown stock, fllavored 
with vegetables and herbs. Pour this 
over the rabbit and let simmer forty- 
five minutes. Dispose a flat bed of 
mashed potato on a serving dish; on 
this set the pieces of rabbit; skun 
all fat from the sauce and strain it over 
the rabbit. Set some crescent-shaped 
croutons of bread around the edge. 
Peeled mushroom caps, with a bit of 
butter in the center of each, baked 
ten minutes, may be set in groups be- 
tween the croutons. 

Rabbit, Hasenpfeffer Style 

Divide the forelegs and the lower 
part of the body into pieces; wash all, 
including heart, liver and lungs, thor- 
oughly; have ready in a saucepan 
fat from salt pork; in this stir and cook 
one or two onions, cut in very thin 
slices; cook until yellowed, then add 
two rounding tablespoonfuls of flour; 
and, finally, about a quart of water 
or veal broth, and continue to stir until 
boiling; add a teaspoonful of salt, a 
small bit of bay leaf, half a teaspoonful 
of black pepper, four cloves and the 
prepared rabbit; cover and let simmer 
until the rabbit is tender. Add a 
generous tablespoonful of butter, half 
a cup of claret and two lumps of sugar. 
The sauce should have a spicy, sweet- 
sour taste, and should not be too thick.

Cooking Rice 



DIRECTIONS for cooking rice 
usually say that the water 
should be boiling, when the 
rice is added, and that it should be 
cooked fast, but that is not the way 
it is done in Brazil, where the perfectly 
cooked rice is one of the chief articles 
of diet. The Brazilian cook uses one 
part of rice to four parts of cold water, 
salted. It is brought to a boil and 
cooked very slowly for three hours. 
Every particle of water is absorbed, 
the rice is thoroughly cooked, and 
each grain stands by itsdf . Rice cooked 
in this way is very different from the 
mushy dish usually served in this 
country. A Breless cooker is ideal for 
cooking rice, for it simplifies the long 
slow cooking which is needed. Since 
I returned from Brazil I have been 
interested to hear a celebrated specialist 




for babies reconunend this Birazilian 
method as the ideal way to prepare 
rice for babies. None of the nutriment 
is wasted, as it is when the water is 
not all absorbed. The brown, un- 
scoured rice should be used, if possible, 
and fortunately it is. getting more com- 
mon in this country. e, s. e. 

Canned Chopped Meat or Sausage 

■ Old Mason or other jars may be 
used for keeping sausage or other meat 
potted in fat. When cooked in their 
own lard, as sausage is, or meat or fish 
potted in melted butter, simply fill the 
jars, cover and invert them; thus the 
melted fat closes the old can well, and 
the contents will keep in a cool place. 

Honey from Hymettus 

Every lover of the Greek life of old 
recalls the wonderful honey of Hymet- 
tus. It has not passed away, as has 
that Greek life. The mountains of Hy- 
mettus may be seen from Athens, and 
from them still is brought that sweet 
product of the busy bee. With our 
present out-of-door life we should get 
back to the simple sweets, such as honey 
and dates for breakfast, with a wheaten 
'oaf and a beverage, with cheese and 
eggs as the heartiest dish permissible. 

Our so-called "cmrants" for Holidays 
come from Corinth in Greece, They 
grow on grape vines, at Corinth, just 
as they doubtless did in St. Paul's 
time. Only now they have been brought 
to California, and the vines flourish 
there; but "currents" they are still 
called, — a corruption of the name Cor- 
inth, perhaps.

It is now a well established fact 
that a pure liquid pepper, such as

Mental Medicine 

Dr. Edward Sanger, who has aban-

dislikes the latter's methods, said in 
New York: 

"We should not announfce cures

had nearly recovered, the doctor did 
not bother to take her temperature, 
and he had hardly got 100 yards from 
the house, when her son called him back. 

"Mother is worse,' said the man.

it at his master's feet. It was a sprig of 
forget-me-not. The truth of this storj- 
is perhaps open to question, but a story 
almost as remarkable comes fixxa a 
Florida correspondent whose veradty 
is undoubted. Jack is a handsome New- 
foundland dog. Every evening at nine 
o'clock he is taken to walk by his 
master, who has an orange-wood stick 
which he particularly likes and usually 
carries. 

Every evening on the stroke of nine 
Jack rushes to the hat-rack in the hall, 
noses about among the walking-sticks 
and umbrellas until he finds the orange- 
wood stick, and immediately afterward 
appears before his master carrying it in 
his teeth. He wags his tail and prances 
delightedly about, and shows as plainly 
as possible that he will be a broken- 
he^^ed dog if hts friend and master 
onnits the usual evening stroll. 

One evening the family were in the 
sitting-room with some guests. A 
shower had come up, and it was raining 
hard when the clock struck nine. The 
strokes had hardly died away when Jack 
danced gayly into the room with the 
orange-wood stick in his mouth. 

"No, Jack," said his master, "we 
cannot go to-night. It is raining too 
hard. We should get wet. Just listen 
to it rain, Jack." 

With that the host turned his atten- 
tion once more to his guests, and pres- 
ently they heard Jack pulling over 
the things in the hat-rack. They sup- 
posed he was putting away the walking- 
stick, like the clever dog that he is.

Caustic Sacrasm 

If you W£int undistilled sarcasm, read 
this anecdote related by Henry Miller, 
whose performance in "The Rainbow" 
is so convincingly strong. 

"We were going along at an awful 
speed," he said. "I didn't see the dog, 
but I heard his 'ki-yi,' so I ordered the 
chauffeur to stop. Going back, we 
found an irate lady standing over her 
dead dog — one of the ugliest dogs yoa 
ever saw. She met us with a tirade 
of remarks, telling us in no uncertain 
terms what she thought of us and auto- 
mobilists in general, finishing up by 
calling us the murderers of her d(^. 
It was then that I thought I would 
pacify her, 'Madam,' I said, 'I will 
replace your dog.' 'Sir,' she sa-d, in 
a freezing tone of voice, 'you flatter 
yourself.' " ^^^____ 

WE have two great Hebrew law- 
givers — Moses and Christ 
The former justified vengeance — an 
eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The 
latter said, "Overcome evil with good." 
We hold to the latter doctrine. Our 
ultimate goal in the salvation of men 
can never be through force, violence 
and vengeance. Yet is not that the 
final result of jails, stripes, iron bare, 
and degradation? Consistent with the 
concession, therefore — and we must 
concede it — that the days of force have 
not passed and the necessity for jails 
and prisons is still very acute — we 
must, nevertheless, keep constantly in 
mind that men eventually must be 
saved through love. It is not incon- 
sistent with a faithful adherence of 
Christian ideals. — Hon. Ben. Lindsey.

Women and Education 

THE difference in the education of 
the sexes in the human family 
never abates for a moment from the 
cradle to the grave. The tiniest girl is 
exhorted to behave in accord with the 
proprieties that shut her out from the 
activities open to her brother. All that 
youth acquires before the age of matur- 
ity becomes the inheritance of the race; 
and thus the manacles which society 
has imposed on its women, as well as 
the progress it has instilled into its sons, 
are inherited equally by both men and 
women. The marked ability which 
women are showing in public work along 
philanthropic lines, in utilizing the power 
of organization, proves nothing if not 
that it was a direct inheritance from 
generations of men. The isolation in 
which the work of women has always 
been carried on could develop no such 
ability for transmission to posterity. 
To what an extent the progress of human 
society has been retarded by the pro- 
longed damming up and diverting of the 
powers of half the race, it is, of course, 
impossible to estimate. But, at least, 
the lesson is plain for any discriminating 
observer of social evolution, that most 
of the so-called sex distinctions between 
men and women are merely the inevit- 
able consequences resulting from differ- 
ent conditions; and just in proportion 
as men and women work side by side 
in the battle of life, submitting to the 
same handicaps and stimulated by equal 
opporttmitiy, will the truth emerge, 
that sex distinctions have been vastly 
overemphasized, and that the physical 
differentiation necessary for the propa- 
gation of the species is strictly limited 
in its field and leaves untouched the 
larger area of human qualities, which 
has been developed in consequence of 
man being a social animal. — Antut C. 
Etz. 



The Quest of Humanity 

IT is undeniable that the great quest 
of humanity is happiness. But 
was the world created to be happy?

How many are truly happy ? I've 
studied people in all classes and condi- 
tions, and everywhere I have found, 
when you get below the surface, that it 
is mostly the insincere individual who 
says, "I am happy." Nearly every- 
body wants something he hasn't got, 
and as things are constructed, what he 
wants is money — more money than 
he has in his pocket 

But after fiU, money can buy only a 
few things. Why should any one envy 
the captains of industry? Their hves 
are made up of those vast, incessant 
worries from which the average indi- 
vidual is happily spared? Worry, worry, 
that is the evil of life. 

What do I consider the nearest a^ 
proximation to happiness of which the 
present nature is capable? Why, living 
on a farm which is one's own, far from 
the hectic, artificial conditions of the 
city — a farm where one gets directly 
from one's own soil what one needs to 
sustain life, with a garden in front and 
a healthy, normal family to contribute 
those small domestic joys which relieve 
a man from business strain. — Thomas 
A- Edison. 

1SEE the day coming when Man, 
with his infinite aptitudes and 
capabilities, joyously creating for him- 
sei good things out of the infinite 
resources of the universe, will hve in a 
world in which youthfulness, wealth, 
abundance, peace, progress and haopi- 
ness will be supreme. — Arthur W. New- 
cotnb.

Since its original publication, Miss Farmer's ''Boston Cooking 
School Cook Book" has, in new editions, incorporated large addi- 
tions, but the wealth of new material — the result of experiments 
in the author's class rooms and embodied in recipes which have 
been thoroughly tested — has grown to such an extent that it has 
become necessary to incorporate it in a separate volume which 
forms an almost indispensable companion to the author's invalu- 
able ''Boston Cooking School Cook Book." 

The " New Book of Cookery" contains more than eight hun- 
dred recipes upon all branches, including many new and import- 
ant dishes not to be found in any other worK. It is profusely 
illustrated.

Women of the Pushcart Markets 

By Jeanette Young Norton 



STREET peddlers are known the 
world over, but in no other city 
do the so-called pushcart mar- 
kets flourish as they do in New York. 
In fact, they are recognized as great 
factors in the economical question of 
how to make the market money go 
farthest, in the poor man's household. 

The woman's place in this out-door 
market world is quite as important 
as that of the man. himself. He rises 
before day break to be at the whole- 
sale market centers in time to get the 
best bargains. He goes to one of the 
dealers who rents pushcarts by the day, 
10 cents on ordinary days, 25 on big 
holidays, gets his cart and trundles 
it away in the murkiness of early dawn. 
Few peddlers own their own carts, though 
they are inexpensive, for the reason 
that they have no place to store them 
nights. 

And again the **garages,'* where they 
are rented, charge ten cents a day 
storage, so it is just as cheap to rent. 

When the peddler comes back with 
his cart loaded, he leaves it at the dealers 
where it is watched and goes home where 
the wife has breakfast waiting, then 
he fares forth for the day. The wife, 
after the children have gone to school 
and her household put in order, takes 
a luncheon and possibly the youngest 
one or two children and goes to the cart. 

Here she stands and waits on cus- 



tomers all day, cares for the stock, 
arranges the sttiff attractively and is, 
in every way, a valuable assistant. 
In many instances the man hires an 
extra cart and she goes in to another 
section of the street with other wares, 
taking with her after school an older 
son or daughter for a helper. 

The range of merchandise which may 
be purchased from pushcarts varies 
with the season, and the time of day 
or evening one visits the markets. From 
clothing, jewelry and furs, to carrots 
and onions is but a step in the pushcart 
world, and a short one at that. Women 
frequently manage the dry goods, kit- 
chen utensils, toys, china and knick- 
knack carts entirely themselves. At 
the fruit centers they polish and ar- 
range the fruit as well as sell. At the 
vegetable carts they clean, cut and 
freshen the bunches, constantly scrub- 
bing the stalks of celery and fenuchi 
until they are temptingly white. While 
at the horseradish cart, where this 
tear inducing relish is grated fresh for 
each customer, it is the woman who 
turns the wheel wiping her eyes patiently 
erst while. 

The pushcart merchant is his own 
boss, his goods are his own, bought and 
paid for before he offers them for sale;

no advertising and has many sharp 
competitors, so his only salvation is 
to "buy cheap." This he is ever 
on the altert to do, taking advantage 
of all that he can hear, see and read 
about, and no exertion or sacrifice 
is too great to make to accomplish his 
object. 

There are specialists among the push- 
cart merchants, as well as in the richer 
markets, and they are unique enough 
to be interestii^ to the sight-seer. 
The "snail" seller has by way of a 
sign at the back of his cart an upright 
board with the snails in their shell 
houses clinging to it; the rest of the 
stock is in the boxes below, and they 
find many purchasers at the modest 
sum of twelve cents a pound. 

The celery cart has every grade and 
sells from a single stalk to the laige 
bunches familiar to general market- 
goers. Unusual fruits are another spe- 
cialty, and include the tropical fruits 
seldom seen on 'the comer stands. 

The sweet herb-and-pepper cart has 



a sweet savory smell, and is a joy to 
the beholder in its riotous coloring. 

The cabbage vender, who has them 
red and white in all sizes, adds to his 
stock "Brussels sprouts" and the aris- 
tocrat of the cabbage family, cauli- 
flowers. ' Another unique cart load is 
formed of beans; they are dried in 
several varieties, some already soaking 
in cold water so to be ready for the pur- 
chasers use almost immediately; others 
are pickled, salted, even sugared, is 
oil, and mashed into cakes to suit all 
tastes. 

The peddler of the leatherette market 
bags strolls leisurely up and down, 
knowing full well, if the bai^ains are 
great, he will sell plenty of bags to carry 
home the overflow from the ones brought 
from home. 

The purchasers do not go in for 
variety, but quality, quantity and sat- 
isfactory price are first considerations. 
Having no place to store extra supplies, 
the vender buys only enough for the 
day's trade; should stock remain over^

the late comers secure many bargains; 
should trade be very lively, then the 
vendor sells out early, in which case, 
i£ the crowd warrants it, he goes home 
and loads up with a little dry merchan- 
dise he has stowed away under the bed; 
it may be china, socks and ties, oil cloth, 
furs or clothing of some sort. The rent 
for the cart has been paid for the day, 
so it might just as well be kept working. 

One would scarcely expect to find 
a bridal veil on a pushcart, but, never- 
theless, behold there it is, with slip- 
pers, gown, gloves and lingerie; even 
the wedding ring is at hand, all for the 
amazing sum of ten or twelve dollars; 
and let it be known that cupid is very 
busy in the pushcart sections, where 
race suicide is apparently unknown. 

And with all their hardships these are 
happy people; a whirr of busy tongues, 
and merry laughter greets one on all 
sides. The tradesmen have a smile on 
their faces and cultivate ingratiating 
ways to bring customers into their 



wiles. And one comes away with arms 
full of bundles done up, not all in brown 
paper, but in the gay sections of the 
Sunday weeklies that have been blown 
that way; the venders smile and the 
cheer banishes pride, and clutching 
the parcel one throws back a smile 
and gay remark to the merchant or 
his wife; for these children of sunny 
skies, quick to anger, quick to smile, 
are not to be taken seriously, ^nd it 
is all part of a pushcart market lark 
and evening's adventure into an almost 
strange land. At night the weird flam- 
ing torches glare fitfully on the gay 
head-shawls of the women and the 
more somber wear of their companions; 
purchasers of all ages congest the space 
between the carts and stands, yet all 
is orderly in the apparent disorder, 
and the blue coated embodiment of 
the law, at the comer, has little to do 
but to keep the crowd moving. 

Now comes a hint from the powers 
that be that the pushcart markets 



■590

.are doomed; "traffic regulations" are 
disturbed by their presence, and they 
have been chased from one spot to 
another, restricted to a certain number 
of blocks in a section where they are 
least in the way, and it looks like the 
beginning of the end. But the ques- 
tion is what will the poor people do 
without them ? Public markets will 
charge more for food and they must 
live, no matter how colorless their 
existence may be, and they bear bur- 



dens enough already. Instead of ban- 
ishing them from existence, why not 
devote one or more open squares to 
their use, or short sections of broad 
streets, where they will not be in the 
"system's" way. It is safe to say, 
education is fitting the children of these 
merchants for other occupations in 
life, and the young married women 
are not likely to go the way their 
hard-working mothers have gone. They 
will become Americans.

PART SECOND 

THE girls who dared are "mak- 
ing good ; ' ' they are very 
happy as related in ■ the Jan- 
uary issue of this magazine; they have 
let their Eastern friends hear from 
them, from time, to time, sending most 
interesting accounts -of their life, of 
which the following is a condensation; 

"This is a very strenuous life we 
are living. I do not know whether 
I can make things real to you, but 
since you wish to turn us into the 
heroines of a story, surely life here 
will afford the material. 

We are not real pioneers, as in the 
olden times, still we are near enough 
to that condition to see just how it 
was. We have the railroad, with a 
post-office and small grocery store within 
six miles. One family, who are our 
most intimate friends, hved here over 
thirty years, when their only com- 
munication with the outside world 
was through the fort about twenty 
miles away. This fort is still occupied 
and is now being made into a regimental 
post. We were there about a month 
ago, driving out and back in a day, 
about fifty miles, over the worst roads 
imaginable, for no roads are made. 
They just drive the most direct route 
possible and if a way cannot be fol- 
lowed any more, they drive some- 
where else. The hills were almost 
straight up and down, and coming 
back we lost the brake on our wagon. 
There were six of us in the wagon 
and the horses could not hold it down 
the hills, so they would start and run 
over rocks and gullies until we thought 
we would never get home alive. 

It is exceedingly thrilling and inter- 
591 



BEFORE WE HAD A HOUSE 

esting as one goes along to have your 
friend say: "Now right here I helped 
gather up the stage driver, and he 
was scattered all over the bushes, 
after an Indian attack." The one 
daughter of this family had married 
and was hving about ten miles from 
the post, when a notice was sent around 
that the Indians were on the war path. 
She was alone with a baby and her near- 
est neighbors were about six miles away; 
she started for the post on horseback 
with the baby, but as she rode up the 
side of one of these hills she saw a 
band of Indians between her and the 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



post. They had not seen her, so she 
turned and went back home and re- 
mained hidden in the cellar for days. 
One of the boys escaped from a band 
of Indians almost where our house 
stands. 

This country was thickly populated 
with Indians, but they seem to have 
been mostly peaceful as the grinding 
stones are found by the dozen. We 
found a very nice piece of pottery 
near the house not long ago. How- 
ever, there are no Indians here now, 
and the nearest reservation is some 
distance away. 

The cowboys are still here, though, 
and are very interesting. Their stay, 
however, we think, is short, if the 
people make a success of farming. 
The cattle men were very much op- 
posed to having settlers come in and 
treated the first comers very badly, 
cutting their fences, etc., but they have 
had to give way. There are two 
large cattle ranches in the valley and 
many private people have cattle on 
the range. The most important thing 
lacking is water and no one can take 
land and get the right to any natural 
springs. The only running water near 
is at Papago Springs, which is about 
a mile and half west of our claim. 
This was one of the last strongholds 
of the Indians. It is beautiful there; 
very heavily wooded, but full of gul- 
leys, canyons they are called. A small 
"canon" or "canyon" is a "draw," 



and in the draws we find "water holes." 
These were interesting things to us 
before we came and found that they 
were only holes in the ground in which 
the water collects and remains indefi- 
nitely. They are usually in a low place 
and, then, the cattle stamp in them, 
and thus make them deeper and the 
bottom solid. Estelle has some quite 
large ones on her claim, but we have 
only one small one. There have been 
thousands of cattle taken off the range 
within the past year; we had two large 
"round ups" near, when they took out 
the yearling steers and bianded the 
small calves. 

This valley must be the crater of an 
extinct volcano, probably before it 
was thrown up from the water, as the 
rocks are full of fossils of shells like 
those found at the sea shore. The 
stones are of a great many varieties, 
with five or six different kinds within 
so many feet, often two kinds melted 
and run together. The hills near are 
limestone and are full of caves. One 
cave is about three-fourths of a mile 
distant, but no white man has been

in it. My neighbor, Mr. M — , dis- 
covered it, not very long ago, when 
he was riding down a canyon and saw 
the sktdl of a man hanging in a tree 
on a hill; he went to investigate and 
found tinder the tree the entrance to 
this cave. It is very* deep; the boys 
think about a thousand feet straight 
down. We have been in one very 
pretty cave to which they have never 
found an end. Two men staid in for 
two days and couldn't find an end, 
but two skeletons have been found; 
one was removed to some museum, 
because it was not an Indian skeleton. 
Once some men got lost in there and 
it took a regiment from the post to 
find them. 

They are taking on3rx from a cave 
west of this. At one place we saw 
the lime is pure, such as is used for 
plastering, only there is so much salt 
in it the cows eat it. There are many 
kinds of minerals, but the mines are 
about twenty miles distant; but this. 
has all been prospected. The Hua- 
chuaea Mountains are full of gold, 
with large paying quantities, right on 
the surface, but the Government has 
that all reserved for their post. One 
of my best friends is just opening a 
copper vein two htmdred and sixty 
feet wide, which he says is the largest 
vein in Arizotia. There is silver here, 
too; sometimes gold, silver and copper 
are all taken from the same mine. 

During May and June it never rains, 
but the rainy season started with July,. 
and it has rained eight inches since. 
The plains are covered with grass, which 
cures on the ground and keeps the cat- 
tle all the year; it is now the most 
beautiful emerald green, EarUer in 
the spring there were dozens of varieties 
of the most beautiful wild flowers, all 
brightly colored, the most vivid yel- 
lows, oranges, streaked with black, 
blues and purples. We had none dur- 
ing the dry weather, but they are 
beginning to come again. The three 



nuisances to be rooted out are the bear 
grass, the sagatones and mescals; all 
somewhat related to the cactus family, 
though not thorny. 

We have a few mescals; these grow 
about the size of a tub and it takes 
them seven years to mature, then they 
shoot up a stem about ten or twelve 
feet high, blossom, fruit, and then the 
stalk dies; we have very little mesquite 
and sage brush. The principal trees 
are white and black oak and jxmiper, 
also, walnut, ash and cotton woods 
along the streams — and once in the 
mountains we saw a little white pine. 

No trees are allowed to be cut with- 
out permission from the forest rangers 
and, then, only the dead trees; the 
juniper is used for fence posts by set- 
tlers. We have a hundred or more 
trees on our place, so we don't care; 
they are all oak except one large juni- 
per. The mistletoe grows plent^ully 
on the oaks. In Arizona the mistle- 
toe has red berries in December and 
January; at first they are pearly like 
other mistletoe. Aroimd Phoenix it 
used to be abundant. 

It is like spring, although we have 
had hot weather, and sometimes too 
cool to sit in the shade — the alti- 
tude you know! The nights are always 
cool. The sunsets are simply gor- 
geous and the sunrises, when we are 
up early enough to see them! 

Several times we have come home 
from dances after daylight and it 
was glorious beyond description. The 
moon and stars, too, are brighter than 
at home; and one can see so far — we 
saw a fire on a motmtain a hundred 
miles away and it seemed near. We 
can see to the East, some hundreds of 
miles, five mountain ranges, each of 
a different color. The view is surely 
fine, one range of motmtains beyond 
another! We are a mile high here and, 
in going to the post, we were eight 
thousand feet. The highest peak is 
ten thousand feet and we are very 
anxious to climb it. 



594 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



We have a trip in prospect for next 
month of one hundred and fifty miles 
on horseback. We shall be gone five 
days and there will be twenty or more 
in the bunch. This will take us up 
this peak and include a dance going 
and coming. We are quite enthusias- 
tic over it. We ride horseback a great 
deal, but often I go behind a splendid 
team, and Rosa and her escort accom- 
pany us on horseback. . 

We girls have a horse of oiu: own 
now and the dearest colt a year old. 
Dolly is a mustang pony, the best 
and easiest horse I was ever on. Mr. 
John M — has five or six saddle horses 
and they are at our disposal at any 
time; we had two of his horses in our 
pasture last week. Rosa is out with 
John — planting our farm, incidentally 
having a good time. My friend will 
harrow it again, so you see the boys 
are some good. 

We have five acres in beans; they 
are the best and surest crop and net 
twenty-five dollars per acre. 

Yesterday I was at our neighbor's 
and made him bread, pies, and a pud- 
ding, washed his dishes and cleaned 
up his house; so we work together. 
Both of these boys ranch alone. 

"A year ago this month I kissed the 
shrine of St. Anne of Beau Pr6, at Que- 
bec — I, a member of a Pennsylvania 
German sect, — and asked her to send 
me some one to love me. Then I had 
never even heard of this town or thought 
of Arizona; but within the year she 
has sent me here, where it was just 
waiting for me. We four surely do 
have delightful times. 

We attended a barbecue the Fourth 
of July, the old cowboy custom of 
roasting a beef whole in the ground. 
We then went to a dance twenty miles 
away and got home the next forenoon. 

When going down Rosa and her John 
had gone on ahead and we got in a 
thtmder storm. We had not seen a 
house for about ten miles, but, at last, 
we came to an old adobe house, and 



went in. It was partly filled with 
hay. After the storm was over, Mr. 
M — went for the horses. As he would 
be gone some time, I decided I could 
put on my dancing clothes right there, 
since it would be dark when we got in. 
Just as I had my*dress off, three Mexican 
men came to the door. They could 
not understand me, nor I them, and 
I surely was scared, but, at last, they 
made me understand that they wanted 
me to be sure and shut the door when 
I left. And I made them understand 
that all I wanted was for them to 
go away, and then we were happy. 

Our housekeeping is not very hard, 
as you may judge by all this fun. 
One week Rosa cooks and I wash dishes, 
and the next week we change work. 
Rosa has been doing all the baking 
of bread so far and has had good luck; 
we wash about every other week, 
but we never allow work to interfere 
with pleasure. 

• We now have a house on each claim; 
mine is a wooden house of just one 
room, twelve by fourteen feet, with 
four windows and a door. Rosa's is 
even smaller and is built of tin, but 
then she only sleeps there. They are 
about a quarter of a mile apart. She 
takes her lantern and trots off at bed- 
time. The reason we live in my house 
is because I have trees on my daim 
and the house is built under a tree. 

We have two hundred and forty 
acres fenced. We tuck in our married 
sister and the baby, when they come, 
and her husband and his father sleep 
outside in western fashion. The baby 
is a true westerner, for she creeps at 
five months and sits alone. Before 
she was three months old we took her 
off on a mountain jaunt of eight miles. 

About our food supplies, we have to 
buy everything, nearly, the first year. 
Everyone eats a great deal of bacon 
and becomes expert in cooking it, and 
baking-powder biscuits. It is hard to 
get fresh meat even with cattle every- 
where on the range. We eat a great 



TWO CITV GIRLS PIONEERING IN ARIZONA 



$^& 



deal of fniit, which we get from a family 
that has lived here thirty years and raise 
every kind; but all kinds sell for five 
cents a pound. 

About the only native things, I know 
of, that we eat are acorns, which are 
smaller than the eastern, but taste more 
like chestnuts. Walnuts are very plen- 
tiful but are rather small. We gathered 
about five bushels last week. Wild 
grapes are also very abundant and are 
just getting ripe, now in July. We 
shall gather some for jelly. They are 
like "chicken grapes" at home. Early 
in the year we made jelly from the 
manzanitos berry. These grow on a 
bush resembling laurel, but the bark 
is bright red and the wood is as hard 
as iron. The bushes are beautiful 
and the jelly tastes something like 
currant. The Mexicans make a whiskey 
and a candy from the stalk of the 
mescal, and preserves from the fruit; 
also from the fruit of the round cactus, 
but I have not yet eaten it." 

Cactus Candy sells for a dollar a 
box when nnailed. It is quite nice 
and resembles crystallized pineapple, 
somewhat. 

An enterprising firm sends out the 
following lines: 

** Across the world we'll send it 

And pay the parcel's post, 
The daintiest confection, 

The one *She* likes the most. 
Crystallized cactus candy — 

Garnered sunshine sweet, 
Grown from virgin soil. 

Child of light and heat; 



Dollar will buy the box. 
We'll send it charges paid; 

Win thanks for something different 
From your own delighted maid." 

If I can not give you much new 
information about cooking, I can teU 
you how I made an awning for a window 
from a strip of tin and two boards, 
and a refrigerator out of a sack and 
a box. It is a peculiar thing here, 
that to keep anything cool one puts 
it in a pail, or jar, and wraps a wet 
cloth around, and places it in the wind; 
soon the contents are so cold as to make 
the teeth ache. We are getting an 
Indian bottle for our drinking water, 
which I suppose you have seen? They 
are not glazed and allow enough water 
to seep through the crock and evaporate 
fast enough to keep the contents cool. 
People have no cellars, only "dug-outs" 
for vegetables. We shall have one, 
when we have vegetables to put in it. 

We draw all our wood and cut it, 
and draw our water nearly a mile. 
The boys would do it for us, but we 
prefer being independent. We have 
four kegs holding about twelve gallons, 
each, and they just fit into our small 
wagon.' 

Thus are these plucky girls making 
a homestead where not long ago Indians 
roamed; they prefer doing this work to 
the strain of civilization and are assay- 
ing the heaviest work without even a 
Mexican or Indian, for a Caliban, to 
* 'scrape trencher and wash dish, and fetch 
in firing at requiring." 




The Lady of the Angel GJce 



By Frances Campbell Sparhawk 



IT'S very nice — yes, delicious. I 
wish you would taste it. This 
was my pick at the picnic," he 
laughed, standing before Amy Hastings 
who had wandered away — although 
only a short distance — from her hos- 
tess, for she was stu-e the latter would 
enjoy a few words alone with the yotmg 
man to whom she had been betrothed 
that very month. Miss Hastings had 
been m^Jdng an uncomfortable third, 
and she had tactfully dropped out and 
seated herself under one of the great 
pine trees where the sighing of the wind 
through the boughs, the sparkle of the 
river flowing by a few yards below and 
the brilliant sky overhead was giving 
her enough to look at and enjoy. She 
had been talking merrily all the morning 
and liked being by herself for a few 
minutes. Yet, when the tall stranger 
had appeared with a plate of her cake 
in his hand, the very cake that she had 
made early that morning to help out 
the friends whom she was visiting, 
the interruption had been pleasant to 
her, probably because she found this 
same tall stranger so agreeable. 

His flattery was all the more delight- 
ftd, because he was so unconscious that 
she herself was the maker of the cake 
he eulogized so warmly. It was a 
pleasurable embarrassment to listen to 
his merry laugh as he declared: 

**Now, if I were the prince of a fairy 
tale, I should not choose my Cinderella 
by her slippers, no matter how dainty 
her feet might be, although dainty feet 
are a great charm! And he had glanced 
slyly at Amy*s small and very pretty 
foot. **I should choose my Cinderella 
from her angel cake,** he had added, 
looking straight into Amy's eyes and 
smiling with an amusement that was 
still unconscious. 

SH 



The girl sprang up. "How the sun 
follows one in the woods," she said. 
**IVe been enduring it until I'm roasted, 
because the view of the river from this 
spot is so lovely. Have you noticed 
it?" 

And if her companion observed the 
flush that her greatest effort could not 
control, he attributed it to the hot sun 
and the sudden motion. And yet the 
strange part of the incident was that he 
began to call her to himself, "the lady 
of the angel cake", because the two had 
come to Him together; and. in his very 
frequent thoughts of her hereafter, he 
continued to call her so. 

"Only a half slice more," he said the 
next moment. "Do take it. How I 
wish you would taste it. No? Then 
here goes; it's too good to waste." 
And he proceeded to eat it himself. 
"Try the river from this point," he 
said. "The view seems to me even 
better." And at his suggestion she 
seated herself on the projecting roots 
of a near-by tree; he dropped down at 
the base of another, a few feet away. 

After a few appreciative comments 
from both upon the scene before them, 
he began to tell her of one of the scenes 
on the Canadian Pacific road, which 
this view recalled to him in miniature. 
"But perhaps you have been there?" 
he asked suddenly. Lieaming that she 
was no traveler, he told her of an adven- 
ture on that road. Prom this he passed 
to other adventures, in which, although 
he prefaced them by, "I knew a fellow", 
or "Some one told me" of such and such 
a thing, Amy suspected that he had 
had more part than he confessed. If 
it were so, he was a traveler of coiuage 
and experience. The former he looked 
and, although young, he might have 
had wide experience. 



THE LADY OF THE ANGEL CAKE 



597 



From these incidents and escapes, as 
some of them certainly were, they came 
to talking of many things. How inter- 
estingly he talked, not to exhibit his 
knowledge, but because thoughts came 
to him and he had f oxmd some one who 
could respond to them. 

"Wen! At last!" cried a girl's 
voice. 

Amy looked up, to find her hostess 
smiling down upon her with eyes so 
mischievous that she suddenly wondered 
how long she had been sitting there 
with the stranger ? Ten minutes ? Half 
an hour? Prom all that she had heard 
and felt, it might have been days. It 
was not an hoiu*. Yet it had marked 
her life. 

The stranger avowed that he had 
been striving to entertain this unknown 
woodland princess. He gave his name, 
Henry Wallace. He was visiting friends 
in the town, as Amy was. But neither 
family was known to the other. He 
bowed himself away, although with 
reluctance. 

The acquaintance was at an end. He 
would never think of it again. It was 
a mere episode. Yet to her it had 
been a revelation of what that man 
mtist be like who cotdd ever be all in 
all to her. While he was with her, she 
had been desperately afraid that in 
some unimagined way it would come 
out that it was she i^ho had made the 
angel cake. But, when he had gone, she 
knew that a joy had gone out of her 
life with him. Her only conafort was 
that no one dreamed of her folly. For 
Amy's beautifiil lips had shut in closely 
all reference to the episode. 

A year went by. And all the while 
the angel cake, which she made many 
times, continued to suggest the prince, 
seen and forgetting, if to her own folly, 
not forgotten. 

The following summer f oimd her with 
her father and younger sister — all 
her family — living in a different city 
and taking up the duties and pleasures 



of life with a heart, not broken, although 
she secretly felt that it was seriously 
impaired. It was a beautiful June 
morning that her sister Katherine turned 
from studying her summer gowns, with 
some criticism but more satisfaction, and 
ran down into the kitchen. 

"Now, Amy," she began, her young 
face bright with eagerness; for she was 
only seventeen, three years Amy's jun- 
ior, and everything as it flew into her 
mind seemed of vast inportance to her, 
"are you too busy to listen?" 

"Try me," answered the other glanc- 
ing up with a smile from the mixture she 
was industriously beating. The girls 
were motherless; to Amy her younger 
sister was very dear, and to Katharine 
Amy's beauty, her graceful carriage, 
her charm of voice and manner were 
fascinations to be perpetually admired, 
and imitated so far as possible. 

"Let's return some of our visits this 
afternoon,' she went on. "WE have 
had a good many, considering that we've 
been here only a little more than a 
month. But if we want them to go on, 
we must be prompt, you know, in pay- 
' ing back those we have had." 

For a moment Amy did not answer. 
She poured out her cake into the pan 
and smoothed and smoothed it there 
with the air of being miles away from 
her sister and the kitchen in which they 
both were standing. For it was a year 
ago that very day that she had sat with 
the stranger in the beautiftil woods, 
with the murmur of the river at their 
feet and the sounds of merriment com- 
ing to them from the distance. And 
now again she seemed to be seeing him 
before her and it was his voice to which 
she was listening while Katharine waited. 

"Amy!" cried the other at last. "Do 
you have to put yoiu* mind into your 
cake as well as your spoon? But 
perhaps that's the reason it's so good," 
she added with a laugh. "Yet it seems 
to me you might be able to answer a 
simple question." . . .. 

"To be sure I will, Katie, dear,;and

exactly the way you want to have me 
do it." 

This was how it happened that Nana 
Brown, in her cool kimono and her 
luxurious chair, glancing up from her 
novel out of the window of her bedroom, 
immediately dropped her book into her 
lap and spoke to her sister in the next 
room. 

"Come here this instant, Rose," 
she called softly, "and tell me who these 
two girls are? I never saw them until 
this moment. But they're making 
straight for our front door. One of us 
must know them." 

"It's not I," retorted Rose. "Per- 
haps they're agents," she added the 
next moment. 

"No, agents don't hunt in couples. 
Besides, these girls have not that cut. 
Well, we're bound to find out, for they're 
coming up the steps now. There's 
the bell." 

After a minute of silent listening, 
the maid entered with cards. 

"What effrontery !" cried Rose. "They 
honor us both, it seems. The name 
doesn't help me at all — Hastings! 
The idea of trying to force themselves 
upon us in this way. It's outrageous! 
Delia," she began, turning to the maid, 
"tell them they've made a mistake; 
they've come to the wrong house; we 
don't know them." 

"No, no! Hold on a minute, Delia," 
cried Nana. "Don't say that. Rose," 
she added to her sister. "They've come 
to the wrong house, of course. But 
I know it's anything but effrontery. 
Prom the glimpse I had of them, they 
are ladies. I'm very sure it's their mis- 
take, not their pushing. I have it now !' ' 
she cried, with another glance at the 
cards. They are the two girls who 
came to town with their father this 
spring. He bought the Armstrong house, 
so, I suppose they mean to live here; 
I've heard of them. To be sure, we 
decided not to call; but that was only 
becwse we had so many acquaintances 



now. When we see them we may 
change our minds." 

"I shan't, retorted Rose. "But I 
suppose we musn't snub them too hard. 
Say we will be down, Delia." And she 
began to get into her gown, a procedure 
which Nana promptly followed. "After 
all," she added to her sister, "when they 
see us, there'll be nothing to explain; 
they'll know instantly that they've 
made a mistake, which will be much 
pleasanter than if we told them of it. 

*Yes," answered Rose. "And if they 
are ladies, as you insist, they will bow 
themselves out of the nearest door." 

"But things did not turn out in that 
way. Por as Rose advanced to greet 
the strangers, Amy said to her: 

"We are so sorry to have been out 
when you and your sister came to see 
us. Miss Brown. We are very glad 
to find you both at home." 

Rose did not dare to glance at Nana; 
but holding Amy's hand in her own, she 
agreed with her sister as to the status 
of the visitors. How beautiful the 
elder was; and the younger if not beau- 
tiful was very wideawake and charming- 
The situation was saved; and they 
should never find out their mistake, at 
least, not until all four had grown 
to be such friends that it woiddn't 
matter. 

But things did not turn out even 
according to this reckoning. 

In five minutes, they were talking 
like old acquaintances. In ten, they 
had discovered mutual friends. Nana 
was secretly delighted at the advice 
she had given; the Hastings girls were 
so bright and interesting, they would 
be an acquisition. She and Rose would 
return this visit very soon. That would 
put matters right if anything should 
leak out; but it wovild not. 

But the next minute, glancing out of 
the window, she saw coming up to the 
house one of the Misses Brown whose 
visit Amy and her sister evidently 
believed themselves to be at that in- 
stant retvimingr 



THE LADY OF THE ANGEL CAKE

Nana would run and meet her at the 
door and explain matters in a breath 
and warn her. But Katharine held her 
by something she was saying to her, 
Delia answered the ring promptly, and 
then it was too late. She threw a 
flashing glance at Rose, which said: 
"Hold tight ! Fight it out on this line !" 

But Rose could not see how. 

Then the catastrophe arrived. For 
as the strangers rose to greet, the new 
arrival, and, also, to take their leave. 
Miss Brown, the second, hearing their 
names — for they were all at too dose 
quarters to allow them to pass without 
a word — turned to ' them and said 
with marked emphasis: 

"I was so sorry you were both out; 
when my sister and I called the other 
day. We had heard of you, and we 
wanted to meet you, not merely to 
leave cards." 

Nana and Rose held their breath. 
The puzzled look, which had dawned in 
Amy's eyes at the sound of Miss Brown's 
name, deepened into conviction and dis- 
may. While she paused an instant, 
breathless also, the speaker added to 
the desperation of the situation by 
saying with a smile at Rose and Nana: 

"You see, girls, you were wise to 
change your minds. You remember 
you told me you were not going to call, 
you had so many friends already." 

As the five stood grouped together, 
in a mesh from which for the moment 
no one could extricate herself, for even 
the speaker perceived that she had made 
a break of some kind, Katharine's 
sense of fun was so great that in spite 
of her embarrassment she giggled. But 
the flush risen on Amy's face deepened to 
crimson; and the sternness of morti- 
fication was in the eyes she fixed upon 
her hostesses. 

"We have come to the wrong house," 
she said, and her voice sounded choked. 
"But we are strangers; perhaps you 
will not tmderstand us. Neither of you 
called her sister by name. That might 
have helped us." 



"We did not want to! "cried Nana 
eagerly. "Of course we understood 
exactly who it was. And we were 
delighted to see you. We meant — " 

"Oh, how amusing!" cried the other 
Miss Brown, who, at first, had been 
piqued that this visit, which must have 
been later than hers, had been returned 
before her own. But it had been in- 
tended for her? It really was very 
amusing. 

"I beg — " cried Nana, still more 
eagerly breaking in where she had been 
interrupted. We were so — one mo- 
ment, Miss Hastings. Let me explain 
to you — " 

For Amy, her color still high and try- 
ing to keep her quivering face stem, had 
turned to the door and was about to 
pass through it. But at the words, and 
espedally the tone, she paused and 
looked back at the speaker. 

"Then you do understand," she said, 
that "my sister and I came to the wrong 
hotise by mistake?" 

"Why, I — " began Nana once more. 

But still again a voice broke in — this 
time a new one. 

For while they had all been too 
much occupied with each other to see 
or hear an3rthing outside, a step had 
sounded on the porch and then in the 
hall, and a man had stood gazmg into 
the room with amazement, at fiirst, even 
bewilderment, then as his eyes fastened 
upon Amy, with a joy approaching 
rapture. 

After all this weary time he had found 
her again, at last — and here — here, 
of all places! .It was no wonder that 
he interrupted and threw back Amy's 
assertion with vigorous denial. 

"The wrong house, my lady of the 
angel cake?" he cried. "Never! Never! 
And so I've found you again, at last!" 
he went on coming forward to her with 
a lightness in his tones to hide the 
emotion in his heart. For he, too, had 
waited and longed, and, also, he had 
sought. 

Amy, looking up, gazed in silence at 



600 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



the tall stranger of the day of the picnic. 
And Nana and Rose greeted their half 
brother, returned sooner than he had 
been looked for from his trip to the 
West. 

"Just a year this very day — but you 
wouldn't remember. Perhaps you do 
not remember me at all? he questioned 
Amy^ still striving to keep the joy out 
of his tones in the presence of others. 
This lady and I have met before,** 
he explained to the wondering group. 
And again he looked at Amy. 

But her fleeting smile of recognition 
and her demure tones, as she acknow- 
ledged that the sky and the river and 
the stranger's interesting stories still 
held a place in her niemory, betrayed 
nothing that she would have hidden. 

He began to tell the others the episode 
of the picnic. "But you surely would 
have remembered a good deal more," he 



said, turning to her, again," if only I 
could have persuded you to taste that 
delicious angel cake I was devouring so 
greedily — " 

"Why !' ' interrupted Katharine proud- 
ly, "has the fame of Amy's angel cake 
gone as far as that?" 

"What! Was it your sister's cake?" 
he cried, wheeling about upon the girl. 

* * Very Ukdy ,' ' she responded promptly ; 
"I remeoiber she told me she made 
some for her friends that morning." 

"Oh, the speech about Cinderella 
and the slippers and the cake, if he had 
been the prince! But he must have 
long ago forgetton such nonsense. No! 
He was saying it to her over again — 
with his eyes! 

"The wrong house," she repeated in 
her farewells to the sisters. 

But in her heart she knew it had been 
the right one. 



The Sweetness of the Hour 



By Eleanor Robbins Wilson 



**Our victories are in our daily work^ 

A FEW warm simny days of May 
had coaxed the apple and pear 
• trees into paradisiacal loveli- 
ness. Boughs, which a month earlier, 
sere and sullen looking, had buffeted 
with roistering winds, now, suddenly 
seemed to sense some fair white dream 
of immemorial Springs. And anon the 
orchard was sweet with original bloom. 

Simultaneously, swarms of great gold- 
en honey bees hovered in and out 
among the blossoms, till the air fairly 
thrummed with their advent. From 
what far hives they had journeyed no 
voice foretold, yet guided by subtle 
fragrances they had found their way 
to these beckoning branches of sweet- 
ness and of service. 

A week later, the shifting pageantry 
of Maytide lured with fresh signals. 
Under the blossom-rifled fruit trees lay 



light drifts of mimic snow — and the 
bees were gone. Here they had wcrked 
and sung and garnered the sweetness 
of the hour. I wondered, if the owner 
of the orchard could say as much. 

The trouble with most of us is we are 
too prone to linger regretfully over the 
blossom-drift of past endeavors and 
ignore the beckoning flower of the pre- 
sent. We watch our apple-bloom dream 
wither, forgetting, imlike the bee, the 
fresh signals. And herein is whwe we 
lose the trail of happiness, and the tang 
and zest of Uving grow stale and profit- 
less. 

There is, indeed, a strange analogy 
between a happy man and a honey bee. 
Both have learned to look for the sweet 
things in life, have cultivated the re- 
quired actunen to recognize such when 
they appear, and devised a way to 
treasure them afterward, till the whole 



THE SWEETNESS OF THE HOUR 



601 



honey comb of memory is filled with their 
sweetness. In short, they have both 
striven for that which has "survival 
value." 

"Actions", says one of our modem 
thinkers, "have survival value accord- 
ing to the degree of good that grows out 
of them." "Survival value" is a new 
phrase, but in it we recognize the only 
satisfactory mental yardstick for measur- 
ing the deeds of past and present. Its 
use is profitable to humble and great 
alike. Luther Burbank, with wizard 
touch creating the spineless cactus that 
is changing Western arid deserts to 
fertile pasture lands, and the woman 
making a happy home, are thereby 
sharers of a common guerdon by thus 
shaping that which is dedicated to the 
future 

Some years ago, a noted optimist 
confided to his followers that the 
secret of happiness lay "in never allow- 
ing one's energies to stagnate." And, 
one by one, as we measure the happy 
people whom we have known with this 
statement, we are obliged to confirm 
the truth of it. Without exception they 
have been men and women wedded to 
progressive ideals and consecrated to 
action. And somewhere back in the 
workaday pathway of rigid endeavor 
they have mastered a touch and go 
blitheness of spirit, a sort of co-ordina- 
ting resilience of mind and body that 
enables them to pass lightly from one 
finished task to the next in the sheer 
joy of accomplishment. 

"The difference in men", says the 
sage of East Aurora, "is largely in the 
way they use the hours that are their 
own. Tell me what a man does between 
seven and ten o'clock in the evening, 
and I will tell you what he is. Also 
I wiU tell you where he will be ten years 
from now." To which I should like to 
add that the difference in women is due 
to precisely the same cause. While the 
determining evidence of a woman's 
character may not be found between 
seven and ten in the evening, the way 



she spends her morning and afternoon 
hours are without question eloquent of 
her destiny. 

The Twentieth Century woman , in 
search of Ponce de Leon'sfabledfountain , 
is learning to look for perennial reju- 
venation in her own mind, and finding 
the price of youth is to keep vitally 
interested in something. We have no 
more convincing proof of this than is 
found in the refreshing personality of 
Mrs. Amelia Barr, who, at the age of 
eighty-three years, has given us an auto- 
biography — "All the Days of My 
Life" — almost eclipsing with charm- 
ing interest any of the sixty novels from 
the pen of this versatile author. Closely 
following this talented young-old lady 
might be mentioned the names of Mme. 
Sarah Bernhardt and Lillian Russell, 
neither of whom has ever allowed her 
interest in life to flag. 

No one grows old so fast or so tm- 
attractively as those whose minds are 
inactive. Just try allowing your mind 
to become passive for a short time and 
note how the jaw drops, the facial 
muscles sag, and the eyes grow luster- 
less. One can readily imagine the in- 
delible effect of prolonged inactivity 
while sensing more acutely the wisdom 
of Cowper's lines, — 
"Absense of occupation is not rest, 

A mind quite vacant is a mind dis- 
tressed." 

It is an tmpleasant picture. Let us 
erase it and turn to the illumined face of 
the worker. 

"Happy is the man who has foimd 
his work," said Stevenson, which means 
the work that makes the strongest 
appeal to one's delight in doing. For, 
not only is it "to business that we love 
to rise betimes and go to it with delight," 
it is tmfailingly this chosen work in 
which we do or shall excel. 

And, by the way, it is just this self- 
same joyousness, felt in honest labor, 
that has lifted household drudgery to 
the dignity of domestic science, and that 
is daily furnishing the Efficiency Expert, 



602 



THE BOSTON CXX)EING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



in every line of tiseftil trade. 

The leagues lying between the plod- 
ding path of the artisan and the glow- 
ing heights of the artist ever must be 
traversed in the winged sandals of rap- 
ture, for "Art is but expression of a 
man's joy in his work." 

Maytime of long ago came over the 
morning hills and one who had labored 
long and diligently was haunted by her 
beauty and , because of this, to-day there 
hangs in the mellowing light of a great 
art salon a wondrous painting breathing 
the fleeting rapture of Spring-tide. One 
other worker there was who also saw 
and listened and now down the years 
there floats the melody of a marvelous 
Spring Song. And there was yet an- 
other master whose joy in his work was 
equally great and he bound the happy 
meaning of Maytime in rhyme. And 
you and I, who come after, taste of 
their treasured sweetness. 



But far removed from these happy 
workers, who excelled in the domain <rf 
literature, music, and art, I like to 
think of a few rare souls who from the 
ordinary wayside trifles of life, the every- 
day common tasks and hardships, have 
extracted an incomparable sweetness. 
Rare souls indeed, the "survival value" 
of whose example lights your life and 
mine to finer issues. 

Work is the spirit's talisman. And 
thrice happy is he who like the bee 
journeys in the direction of promise, 
toward "some glad to-morrow of the 
mind." His song is the "open sesame" 
of hope. And we who watch marvel 
not that he harvests richly. He has 
attained a phase of spiritual abandon 
that enables him to extract the gold from 
the heart of each day's privileges. He 
has learned to work, and sing, not only 
to gamer, but to perpetuate the sweet- 
ness of the hour. 



The Burned Florentine Meringue 



By Ladd Plumley 



MR. UPJOHN jammed his fore- 
finger against the press but- 
ton to the elevator. He was 
frightfully late and he wondered what 
had happened. Again he jabbed the 
button, and as he did so he heard a 
tinkle somewhere skyward. 

Presently a gruff voice from a far 
region above came down the shaft. 

"Car out of order — stuck!" 

Upjohn jumped for the stairway. He 
had lost five precious minutes. The six 
long flights were leaped upward as if 
he were a chamois frolicking on the 
Matterhom. 

**How terribly late you are !" exclaimed 
Mrs. Upjohn, as her breathless htisband 
yanked open the door of the front 
cubical of the Uttle apartment. 

"Trial balance out — subway block — 
elevator busted!" sputtered the tardy 
one, grabbing a futile kiss. 



"The woman never came. I cooked 
the dinner," blurted out the flushed 
Mrs. Upjohn. "And the most horrible 
thing, Beverly! My lovely Florentine 
Meringue is burned to a cinder. You'll 
have to dash out to the bakeries — 
you'd better dress first." 

"Drop down, you mean — the fire 
escape would be the quickest," said 
Upjohn, diving toward his room for a 
lightning change into dinner clothes. 

It was a quarter to seven as he shot 
past the clock in the dining-room. He 
could see that he must be the swiftest 
in the evolutions that were to come. 

Two dextrous minutes, and he was 
in his patent leathers. He had intended 
to shave, but he .would have to shirk 
that. He went through the performance 
as a soldier grabs together his accout- 
erment in the face of a night attack. 
And while he was still screwing his 



THE BURNED FLORENTINE MERINGUE 



6Q3 



mouth before the mirror, yanking at the 
loops of the Satanic tie, the bell clattered 
the warning that some of the guests 
had come. His wife's voice came, as 
she sped from her pans to the door, — 
"Beverly, do hurry!" 

The Upjohns had not been the 
Upjohns long. This was the second 
year of the combination. Generally 
they took their dinners in the restaurant 
of the apartment ' house. This little 
dinner, with their own pretty dishes 
and new silver, was in return fpr dinner 
invitations from two couples who lived 
in a far less modest manner than did 
the Upjohns. Nattu'ally, Mrs. Upjohn 
wanted everything to go just right. It 
was most trjdng that the woman who 
helped at private dinners should not 
have come; it was more trying that 
the Florentine Meringue should have 
been burned. 

After waiting what seemed an end- 
less time for his wife to come to the 
kitchen and instruct him in the nature 
of his purchases, Upjohn raced from the 
door and to the elevator. He might 
have known it. Blows of hammers 
toward the roof told that the repairs 
on the car had not been completed. 
If, on the way up, Upjohn had been a 
froUckmg chamois, on his way down, 
he dropped almost as if he had been a 
mountain climber in the Alps and had 
lost his footing. 

As he rushed into the street he was 
not clear as to what he would sub- 
stitute for the meringue. One thing 
was certain: He would Hot buy choco- 
late eclairs. Among apartment dinner- 
givers, eclairs are the resource of the 
shiftless. What he decided upon was 
Napaleons. He himself considered Nap- 
oleons delectable. There was some- 
thing distinguished about Napoleons. 
And after Napoleons the tale of the 
meringue might possibly be told and 
bring a laugh. 

There was a crowd in the first bakery, 
and, until his turn came, Upjohn fid- 
geted, 



* 'Sorry r* said the saleswoman. 
"We've sold the last Napoleon. We 
have — " and she named many things, 
letting her voice linger on "chocolate 
eclairs." 

Upjohn dashed from the store. There 
was an excellent bakery two blocks 
further down the avenue. 

Again a crowd; Upjohn wondered 
if everybody had burned their meringues. 
His turn came at last. 

"Napoleons!" said the girl. "We 
never bake Napoleons on Friday. Now 
we have chocolate — " but Upjohn was 
diving toward the door. 

On the nm he visited three other 
bakeries, two above the street where 
he lived and one five blocks below the 
first. His mind refused to consider 
other things; it held firmly to Napoleons. 

But in' the last store his common- 
sense mastered him. He saw that 
there was a Napoleon famine in his part 
of the city. Perhaps he had better take 
charlotte russes. But when he asked 
the woman, he was amazed to discover 
that charlotte russes had been sold out. 
Away he ran. 

The jeering face of a clock, as he 
leaped past the window of a jeweler's, 
pointed a warning finger at the half 
hour. He could not have believed that 
time was such a sprinter. 

He had been a sprinter himself in 
his college days. He tiuned on full 
steam and raced back ai^d forth along 
the street. But to his horror there 
were no charlotte russes to be had. And 
on the return to the bakery of his first 
defeat he woke up to the fact that 
he must get something. By this time 
the saleswomen probably thought that 
they were trying to satisfy a crazy 
customer. 

"Give me two dozen chocolate eclairs," 
said Upjohn firmly. 

"Only three left," replied the woman. 
"You see— " 

"For heaven's sake, give me the 
three!" 

Now there had con^e a sudden and 



604 



THE BOSTON COOKING^CHOOL MAGAZINE 



unprecedented famine in eclairs. In 
a frantic condition, here and there, 
Upjohn garnered together seven, and 
in aknost as many paper bags. Beyond 
this fateful ninnber nothing could avail. 
At this final place of eflEort he joyfully 
took another bag containing a dozen 
spice cakes — and if there was anything 
that he loathed, it was spice cakes. 

Into his grilled door, in a street of 
grilled doors, he plimged, paper bags 
pressed to his bosom. He kjiew that 
he was destroying the eclairs, but he 
was beyond caring for that or anything. 

Of course, they were still tinkering 
with the elevator. And if it was a 
frolicking chamois that had first moun- 
ted the stairs, the second time it was a 
perspiring lunatic laboring upward with 
an infinity of paper bags. 

"My goodness!" exclaimed his wife, 
as Upjohn dashed his purchases to the 
top of the stationary tubs. "I don't 
know what they think. I told them 
that you had been called out for a 
moment. And I hope that you didn't 
get chocolate eclairs." 

There is no need to repeat what 
Upjohn said. And when he staggered 



into the front room, the guests probably 
thought that something liqtiid was re- 
sponsible for the dazed eye and purple 
face of their host. 

As has been said, the Upjohns gen- 
erally take their dinner in the restaurant, 
but Mrs. Upjohn cooks their little 
breakfasts. Every morning Upjohn 
goes out and buys warm rolls. 

The morning after he had managed to 
preserve a degree of calmness, when 
his wife brought to the table a platter 
of squashed eclairs and shattered brown 
abominations, he stepped into the near- 
est baker's shop for the rolls. And 
there on the counter lay a full tray of 
an infinity of charlotte russes, and in 
a rack near him was an assortment 
of dozens of pleasing little cakes. As 
he turned toward the door, a baka''s 
boy was entering with a giant tray that 
filled up almost the entire space between 
the counter and the wall. Upjohn 
glanced within, there lay in ranks 
enough Napoleons to give indigestion 
to a regiment. 

"Send all those Napoleons to my 
place," ordered Upjohn. "I'm going 
to eat two after my dinner forever."

Meeting the Problem of Living 



By Eva J. DeMarsh 



IN this day, when we hear so much 
about the high cost of living and 
view with wonder and dread our 
depleted pocketbooks, what can we 
who are possessed of but moderate 
means do, not only to make ends meet, 
but, as well ,to provide for the inevitable 
rainy day? 

Well, for one thing, we can live 
simpler lives. Two of the happiest, 
most intelligent people the world has 
ever known lived in a garden and wore 
a nondescript dress of fig leaves. Of 
coiirse , we have journeyed a long dis- 
tance from that Garden, in more ways 
than one, yet has it its lesson for us. 
Not until Adam and Eve grew in knowl- 
edge and their wants multiplied even 
as their desires, did their troubles begin. 
How about us? Do we really need all 
the things we think we do? Of course, 
we know much of which our ancestors 
never heard, a considerable ntmiber of 
us think we must have an extensive and 
expensive wardrobe, live in two or more 
houses, be waited upon by servants, and 
eat a great many kinds of foods, served 
in as many courses, which is all very 
well in its way, but how about those 
who can only follow in varying stages 
of weak imitation. Does not common- 
sense demand that they be themselves, 
live their own lives, in their own way, 
worship God from their hearts, without 
so much form and ceremony, • govern 
themselves, their families, their church, 
their State, their nation, along simple, 
straightforward lines. Life has many 
phases, and one phase may be as good 
as another. 

Few of us in this day and age know 
what simplicity means. Even our babes 
have a miiltitude of toys, many of them 
intricate in design and expensive in 
price. Are they any happier than you 



were over your rag doll or first pocket- 
knife? Not long since I saw in the 
ward of one of our city hospitals a 
beautiful little boy only four years old, 
imder treatment for double rupture and 
ringworm. The children's ward being 
full, he was placed iji the women's ward. 
During all the days of his treatment and 
convalescence twice only did he com- 
plain, and that was when he was operated 
on and when the stitches were removed. 
And what do you suppose were his 
sources of amusement? Lying flat on 
his back, to hfetndle over and over some 
coins in a box, open and shut a fan, 
look at the pictures on it, eat his meals, 
and, now and then, talk a little with a 
nurse or a patient. Few grownups, 
methinks, could have been as sweet 
and brave afe he. Suppose little Willie 
had been the pampered dajrling of a 
family who scorned simplicity and gave 
him everything he wanted, do you 
suppose he would have been the same 
quiet, cheery little sotil he was ? Hardly, 
methinks. 

Complexity and artificiality make of 
life a bugbear, instead of a blessing. 
They promote neither health, longevity 
nor happiness,and,to meet their demands, 
men squander time, money and strength 
that had much better be bestowed 
elsewhere. God nmde the world full 
of sweet, simple things; to man He gave 
one life, one body, one soul, one brain, 
one pair, each, of the vital organs, and 
one , each , of the senses which contribut- 
to his happiness andweU-being, and, yet, 
we crowd heart and life, brain and stom- 
ach, to the limit, in the mad effort to 
have as much, or more, than our fellows, 
and then we say it costs. Why, so it 
does. A few serviceable, attractive 
pieces of clothing for each season, a

MARCH 

Snow-laden branches of the pine 
Drip softly in the mild sunshine; 
And gentler airs now bring 
A faint foretaste of Spring. 

On the horizon, leagues away. 
The forest trees are etched in gray. 
And vauge and misty lie 
Against the melting sky. 

Below protecting banks of snow 
The little streamlets swiftlier flow. 
The frozen womb of earth 
Foresees the pangs of birth, 

And in a hollow cup of mould, 
Green-rimmed and sheltered from the cold. 
Bom or these softer days, 
A single windflower sways.

AN ANNOUNCEMENT 

OUR magazine year begins with June. 
With the coming issue of that 
month we propose to introduce a change 
in the name of the magazine. The 
Boston Cooking School, in connection 
with which we engaged in starting this 
publication, was merged into a depart- 
ment of Simmons College som6 years 
ago, leaving this publication entirely 
independent. Now we have concluded it 
will be advantageous in every respect to 
carry a more comprehensive name. 
The name long considered and finally 
decided on is AMERICAN COOKERY. 
This will appear on our cover page as 
follows: "AMERICAN COOKERY," 
formerly THE BOSTON COOKING 
SCHOOL MAGAZINE of Culinary Sci- 
ence and Domestic Economics." 

We wish to state plainly, here and 
now, that no other changes, save in 
the way of natural growth and inprove- 
ment, are in contemplation. The man- 
agement, editorship, as well as the 
character of the magazine all are to 
remain the same as in the past, and, 
though the cost of most things, in the 
last decadCj has nearly doubled, our 
subscription price will not be changed. 
That we are now giving more in actual 
value for jnoney received than any 
publication with which we are acquain- 
ted is generally conceded. In a word, 
then, the magazine will be identically 
the same, a special periodical of the 
highest class, only carrying, we believe, 
a broader title. 

We wish to repeat and let it be 
clearly understood that, in reaching our 
conclusion and taking this step, our 
single object is to be regarded as an 
endeavor to increase the circulation and 
enlarge the scope and usefulness of a 
culinary publication that has been re- 
ceived far and wide with distinct favor. 

In our April and May ntunbers we 
will print on this page a facsimile o 
the new title just as it will appear at 
the head of our first cover page.

CONDITIONS OF HEALTH 

A CHAPTER in Ralph Waldo Trine's 
latest work, **The New Alinement 
of Life," shows well how far we are get- 
ting away from the old idea of the nec- 
essity of subduing the body in order to 
keep paramount the things that per- 
tain to the spirit. "Health," he says, 
"is the natural and the normal — tm- 
questionably it is the God-intended; it 
should not, therefore, be so hard to 
preserve it," **Its opposite, physi- 
cal debility, sickness, suffering, comes 
through the violation, either on one's 
own part or on the part of others, of 
the laws of ovbr being, or of the laws of 
the Universe about us. This violation 
may be made intentionally or uninten- 
tionally, knowingly or inadvertently — 
the results are primarily the same. 
For the body is of material structure, 
and gets its food, its sustenance, its con- 
tinued life, from material agencies, such 
as food, air, water. It demands the 
right kinds and the right proportions 
of these material reqturements, the 
same as it demands right directing and 
regulating through the channel of the 
mind. 

To keep the body clean is one of the 
essentials, from the physical side — def- 
initely and habitually, rather than spas- 
modically, dean; as, or even more, 
essential perhaps is it, that our stirround- 
ings be kept clean and free from all 
types of refuse. To give the body the 
food it requires is a prime requisite — 
the nourishing and the sustaining, rather 
than the fancy kinds, not too much of 
it, and the less of flesh-foods the better. 

It is a well-established fact that the* 
majority of people eat too muchi They 
take more food, especially with \mder- 
exerdse, than the body can assimilate, 
and the result is superflous fatty deposits. 
This is especially true around middle 
age, when the body is no longer grow- 
ingj and hence does not require the 
amount of food it required when the 
process of growth as well as of waste 



was going on. The result is the taking 
on of superfluous flesh, the tendency 
to exercise still less, degeneration of the 
heart muscles, hence impaired breathing, 
which deprives the body of one of its 
greatest soiu-ces of strength and energy. 
An abundance of pure air, full, deep 
breathing, and especially out-of-door 
air, is one of the first essentials of sound 
health and of unimpaired vitality. If 
this can be combined with adequate 
daily exercise in the open, whether it 
take the form of work or of play, and 
if the exercise is as simple even as that 
of walking, so that it is done regularly 
and with the right spirit and purpose 
back of it — an alert and purposeful 
mind — so much the better. 



Sleep is nature's great restorer — one 
of the great rebuilders of both mind and 
body. When we rob them of the re- 
required amount, we are thereby con- 
tracting bills that will present them- 
selves for settlement sooner or later, but 
without fail. It may seem for a while 
that no accotmt is being kept — but, 
believe me, it is. 

"To thus wisely order the material 
side of life, realizing the value of moder- 
ation, and the wisdom always, and in 
all things, of the 'middle ground,' will 
lead to that sunny, peaceful, healthy, 
and serene old age that should be the 
natural outcome of every life. 



We will not, then, think ill health, 
disease, weakness, or loss; we will not 
talk them — we will not expect them. 
We will think health, we will talk 
health — but not too much — we will 
expect it. The subconscious mind is 
powerful in its workings. It follows 
suggestion. If we continually suggest 
to It health and strength, it will 
work for us along these same 
lines. No man or woman is a failure 
in health, the same as in anything in 
life, who keeps cheerful and buoyant 
and expectant. They alone fail who 
give up and lie down."

USE YOUR MAGAZINE 

REMEMBER this is your magazine. 
Our desire is to make it better, of 
more use to you. Freely write us sugges- 
tions regarding what you would like to 
see in its pages, whether it be more reci- 
pes, more menus, or more lessons for 
beginners, etc. We want ideas and we 
want to know what your needs are. 

If you see anything new or inviting, 
why not send it to us? Possibly, too, 
some of you coiild write for publication 
an article on some phase of home life 
with which you are especially familiar. 
We are pleased to read articles of this 
kind. The more material we have to 
choose from, the better the contents of 
the magazine will be. 

We have just gotten out a new pre- 
mium list; aJso, we are glad to sell by 
mail the articles included in this list. 
If you are interested, send for it. In 
each article we offer the best there is in 
the market. We are prepared to cor- 
respond about these things as well as 
the books we carry on our page of 
Books on Domestic Economics. Large 
mails are very acceptable at this office. 

DR. GRENFELL has recently stated 
a truth which is beginning to be 
accepted by all intelligent people. He 
says, in substance, that the ability to do 
something worth while for the benefit 
of society is a more valuable gift than 
anything which money can buy. It 
is sometimes asserted that men like 
Rockefeller, Carnegie, et a/., take up 
works of benevolence in order to turn 
aside the public disapprobation of the 
methods by which their vast forttmes 
were created. Most people know that 
no one man has the right to acctmiulate 
and administer such fortunes as they 
hold under their control; but as they 
are men of intelligence, it is only fair 
to suppose that, after they have made 
their many millions, they become aware 
of the fact that there are opportunities 



for creative work for the common 
good which are much more hanorable 
and deserving of fame and hoaor than 
any fortune that can be made by the 
ordinary methods. They missed their 
opportunities in their youth, but in 
their old age they recognized the greater 
glory of tmselfish work for the common 
good in the banishment of disease 
and the spread of knowledge. Their 
later work is wholly good. Let them 
have the credit of it, while we deny 
that they have any right to control 
such vast resources. C. R. 

ON these editorial pages we are wont 
to give items culled from various 
sources. We intend that these items be 
timely, interesting and suggestive, and 
always such as we can approve and com- 
mend. How people are living and what 
they are thinking about the present con- 
ditions of life can never be uninteresting. 
To give expression to the thought of the 
day on a single subject is no easy mat- 
ter. In a wilderness of ideas, few there 
are that have not been expressed far 
better than we could do ourselves. 

AMONG our notices of new books 
this month may be found several 
books of special interest and value. The 
Art of Living Long, by Comaro is a curi- 
osity. It gives the experience of a re- 
markable character, who lived about 
three htmdred years ago and rotmded 
out a century and more of active life and 
healthy enjo)rment. The perusal of this 
book makes us feel poor. How much 
have we gained in knowledge of living in 
the course of centuries? Comaro's secret 
of living long was "temperance in both 
eating and drinking' ' . We heartily com- 
mend his nile of life. He acted in 
accordance with the proverb, "Not to 
satiate one's self with food is the science 
of health". As a people we should give 
heed at once to the temperate life and 
begin to practice the only sure course 
that leads to health and longevity.

one overlapping another, entirely around 
the paste. Cut green gage (preserved) 
plums in quarters down nearly to 
the stem end; remove the stone, and 
fold the ends of the sections in towards 
the center; set one of these inside 
the peaches in each tart; set a cherry 
in the center of the plum. Serve 
on the day of making.

FOR breakfast a ready-to-eat cereal 
is given and if the preparations for 
breakfast are made the night before- 
hand, the final cooking of the meal 
should not tax one. In serving let 
each choose an orange or the cereal as 
the combination of the two in the same 
meal is not harmonious. Broil the 
bacon over a dripping pan in the oven, 
while the oven is heating for the muflSns. 
For the muffins use the recipe given 
for Graham muflSns in the Novenber 
number of this magazine; substituting 



rvemeal for the Graham flour. The 
rye meal makes an exceptionally sweet- 
tasting muffin. Note the directions 
•previously given for heating the iron 
muffin-pan. Cut the liver in thin 
slices, pour on boiling water, then dry 
on a doth and roll in flour. Heat 
some of the bacon fat in a frying pan 
and in this cook the liver until browned 
on one side, then turn to brown the 
other side. But half of the liver will 
be needed for breakfast, the other half 
should be set aside in the refrigerator, 
at once. If left in the kitchen until 
after breakfast, it will not be in good 
condition to keep for the next day. 
Melt two or three tablespoonfuls of 
butter in a sauce pan; into this turn the 
potatoes, cooked Tuesday and cut in 
small thin slices on Tuesday night, 
sprinkle on half a teaspoonful of salt 
(for about a pint of slices) then turn the 
potatoes over and over to distribute 
the butter evenly; add about three- 
foiu1;hs a cup of milk and let cook 
slowly; stir gently once or twice; then 
cover and set them on an asbestos mat 
until breakfast is ready. 

As soon as possible after breakfast 
wipe the shoulder of lamb with a damp 
cloth, and set to cook on the rack in 
a steam cooker. Pour about three 
pints of boiling water into the cooker, let 
boil rapidly about ten minutes, then 
let simmer until dinner tinie. About

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



four pounds of lamb should be purchased 
and this should be sent home on Tues- 
day, to insure its being cooked for the 
dinner at noon. 

After setting the meat to cook, make 
the prune jelly and the custard; pare the 
potatoes and let them stand in cold 
water until half an hour before dinner 
is to be served. The cabbage was left 
over from Tuesday; cut this in shreds, 
measure out the ingredients for a cup 
and a half of white sauce (three .table- 
spoonfuls, each, of flotir and butter and 
one cup and a half of milk) ; roll three 
or foiu" crackers, and mix the crumbs 
with two or three tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter. Cook the peaches 
(soaked over night) and make the mac- 
aroons; also break the macaroni into a 
sauce pan. Do not cook the macaroni 
until an hour before supper, as it will 
absorb the flavors added to .it much 
more readily when hot. None of the 
work for the day is at all difficult, and 
it may easily be finished by half past ten 
or eleven o'clock and thus give an hour 
or more before dinner to spend in other 
parts of the house. At supper the 
cooking of the macaroni must be watched, 
the tomato sauce made and the muffins 
left over from breakfast be toasted. 

The prunes are left over from Tues- 
day; about a cup of prunes, freed of 
stones, will be needed. If the quantity 
of prunes be small, add more mar- 
malade or lemon juice or candied peel, 
cooked soft in boiling water. Sherry 
wine or orange juice may be used to 
increase the flavor. About one cup 
and a half of prunes and liquid are re- 
quired. To this add from one-fourth 
to one-third a cup of sugar and 
one-fourth a p;ackage of gelatine, 
softened in one-fourth a cup of cold 
water. If ice be not at hand, it is 
doubtful if the mixture will jelly in 
time for dinner. In this case, sub- 
stitute Prune Whip for the Jelly. 
Press the prunes through a sieve 
(the same quantity as for jelly), add 
one-third a cup of sugar, one table- 



spoonful of lemon juice and let heat in 
a double boiler; when scalding hot fold 
in the whites of two or three eggs, 
beaten dry, and let cook to set the 
eggs, stirring meanwhile. Serve hot 
or cold, with the cold boiled custard. 

For the custard, to be used with 
either dessert, scald one pint of milk 
in a double boiler; beat the yolks of 
three eggs, add one-third a cup of sugar 
and one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt 
and beat again; when small bubbles 
appear on the edge of the milk next the 
dish and the water is boiling vigorously 
below, pour a little of the hot milk on 
the eggs and sugar, rmx thoroughly 
and stir into the rest of the hot milk; 
continue to stir until the mixture thick- 
ens a little, then strain into a cold dish. 
Perhaps you have only two egg-yolks 
for the custard. Scald the milk as 
before, stir one or two level teaspoon- 
fuls of constarch or potato flour with 
cold milk to a thin, smooth consistency, 
then stir into the hot nulk; continue to 
stir two or three minutes, then cover 
and let cook fifteen minutes; then add 
the yolks and sugar as before. Half 
an hoiu" before dinner, put the potatoes 
over the fire; make the white sauce for 
the cabbage, add the cabbage, turn 
the mixture into a buttered dish, cover 
with the buttered crumbs and set into 
the oven. Make a cup of drawn butter 
sauce, using cold water or some of the 
lamb broth (freed of fat with tissue 
paper) for the liquid. This is the same 
sauce, with the exception of the variety 
of liquid, given for the fish on Tuesday. 
When ready to serve beat in the extra 
butter, two tablespoonfuls of capers 
and a teaspoonful of lemon juice or 
vinegar. Set the lamb broth aside in 
a cool place for use on Thursday. Broth 
is much better, if it be cooled quickly. 

At five o'clock, set the macaroni to 
cook in rapidly-boiling water, and let 
cook until tender, adding boiling water 
as needed. When done drain, rinse in 
cold water and drain again. Have 
ready a cup pf hot tomato sauce, the 



OUR DAILY BREAD

gnocchi left over from Tuesday, cut 
in bits, and about one-fourth a chili 
pepper, chopped exceedingly fine. The 
sauce calls for two tablespoonfuls, each, 
of butter and flour and one cup of cooked 
tomatoes pushed through a sieve. All 
of the tomato save the seeds should 
pass through the sieve. One-fourth a 
teaspoonful, each, of salt and pepper 
will season the sauce. To the sauce 
add the chopped pepper, mix thoroughly, 
then pour the sauce over the macaroni 
and the bits of gnocchi; lift the. macaroni 
with spoon and fork to mix all evenly 
together, then let stand undisturbed 



over hot water, and covered, until 
the family are seated at the table. 

The recipe for the oatmeal maca- 
roons provides from twelve to eighteen 
little cakes. To make these, beat one 
egg light; gradually beat, in half a cup 
of sugar, half a tablespoonful of melted 
butter, one-fotirth a teaspoonftd of salt 
and, lastly, one cup and one-fourth of 
rolled oats. Drop from a teaspoon 
on to a buttered baking sheet and shape 
in symmetrical rounds. Bake in a 
moderate oven. Lift from the tin to a 
wire cooler with a spatula. As these 
keep well, the recipe might be doubled.

Reducing Time Spent in the Kitchen 

By Jessamine Chapman Williams 



NO homekeeper wishes to spend 
more time than is absolutely 
necessETy in accomplishing the 
kitchen duties. There are many other 
fields for her time and efforts that are 
just as important and, perhaps, more 
interesting. Time saved in kitchen work 
will make these other duties and plea- 
sures, otherwise impossible, a realiza- 
tion. It may be only a minute, here 
and there, in doing this or that, that 
time may be saved, but the minutes 
count up into hours, and it is then the 
housekeeper will be glad she studied the 
problem of kitchen economy of time. 

With pencil in hand, then, let her 
enumerate the various methods to em- 
ploy in saving time in doing the kitchen 
work. The first item on her list must 
necessarly be; 

1. A convient workshop. No efficient 
workman will endure an inconvenient 
place for business, if there is a way of 
avoiding it. The kitchen must be as 
near as possible a model workshop. 
Consider the relative positions of the 
necessary machinery of the kitchen, the 
stove, the sink, the work-table, and cup- 
boarc^. Can a step or two be saved, 
were the table placed somewhere else? 
Is the table placed where there is a good 
light? Woiild it be more convenient 
to have the table a moveable one, placed 
on castors and moved near the stove 
during the preparation of a meal; near 
the sink during the dish washing; and 
in some out of the way place when not 



in use ? And its construction is a 
consideration. Is it dumsy and heavy 
to move, of a height that does not 
cause backaches in working at it, cov- 
ered with something easy to keep im- 
maculately clean with little effort ? A 
service plate, which is simply a sheet of 
tin about the size of the table top, is 
considered to be a labor and time saver 
by some. The cereal may be measured 
over it; the egg-beater, soiled utensils, 
cups with dripping sides may be placed 
on it, ingredients for a cake measured 
on it, vegetables and fruits pared on 
it, thus saving a constant wiping of 
the table. Is dish washing to be done 
at the sink or on the table? Batter 
mixed in the pantry or on the table? 
The table's use will determine its struc- 
ture and position. A table built on 
the hospital order, iron, white enameled, 
with two glass shelves, light, of the 
right aze and height, easy to clean, on 
castors to move near the stove at meal- 
servihg time, near the sink at dish- 
washing time, is one of the best types 
of kitchen machinery. 

Next, is it possible to save time at 
"sin k duties"? Here again, it makes a 
difference what material the sink is 
made of, its height, its depth of 
basin, the convenience of drain-boards, 
and the methods of manipulating the 
faucets. One needs to work at a sink 
to test its efficiency. At first, one 
might not notice that a particular sink 
was built with so shallow a basin that, 



REDUCING TIME SPENT IN THE KITCHEN 



623 



when washing dishes in it, a slopping 
of water over the edge and on the 
floor would be an inevitable result. Be 
sure a dish-pan can set down flat in the 
sink, and not rock about, because the 
basin is too narrow. 

Of all the kitchen implements there 
is none so important as the stove. Nine- 
tenths of the labor of the kitchen centers 
around it. To obtain a satisfactory 
stove is a problem. The kind, size, 
height, quickness in heating, ease in 
regulating, and ease in cleaning will 
have more to do with time-saving than 
anything else. Why are most stoves 
built with an oven so low that it is 
necessary to get down on one's knees to 
use it? And why are ovu* kitchen 
ranges so decorated? Could not the 
nickle trimming be omitted and time 
be saved in cleaning? Why is the 
warming oven built so high that the 
average person has to stand on a chair 
to dust it? The energetic housekeeper 
will find the best stove on the market, 
knowing that it will mean a time and 
labor saver. 

Discard all useless, unnecessary ar- 
ticles -of fumittire, utensils, and orna- 
ments. If the modem kitchen is a 
work-shop, it can not be a sitting-room 
as well. The Boston rocker and the 
red, table-cloth, covered table may have 
had their places in the old New England 
kitchen, which was also the family 
living-room; but in the modem work- 
shop kitchen the high work stool must 
occupy the place of the Boston rocker. 

A place for everything is obviously a 
path to time saving. The time lost 
in hunting for a paring knife, a certain 
kind of basin, or the pepper box can 
count up as fast as moments saved 
somewhere else, and hence no gain is 
made. Things are often just "dropped 
in** the table drawer or kitchen cup- 
board and then must come the ''fishing*' 
process to find a particular utensil. 
A drawer, divided into compartments, 
and like things put together is a saving 
of minutes and perhaps hours of time. 



Study the placing of equipment and 
tools in the tiny box of a dining-car 
kitchen, then think of the elaborate 
meals served to such numbers of people 
from it. Could such be accomplished 
without a careftd study of economy of 
space, time, and labor? 

Given, then, the most convenient 
work-shop and the most convenient 
tools for work, are there other means 
of saving time quite as possible or more 
so? 

2. The kitchen duties. What are the 
kitchen duties ? Nine-tenths of the work 
consists in meal getting, serving, and 
cleaning up after meals. Time can 
be lost or saved early in the day with 
regard to meal preparation. First, know 
the menu for the day; second, take an 
inventory of supplies on hand; third, 
order additional suppUes. It is so easy 
to put off ordering the meat tmtil late; 
then so easy to find fault because it 
wasn't delivered on time, then follows 
a scramble to cook some emergency 
dish as a substitute, or an unnecessary 
delay caused in serving the meal inter- 
fering with other engagements for the 
day. With a definite menu planned for 
each meal, and the supplies ordered 
and delivered promptly, a good start 
is made. 

Now in the actual preparation of a 
meal, how economize? Before even 
going to the kitchen, know what the 
processes involved are and the order of 
procedure, the time requied to prepare 
food for cooking, the length of time 
needed in cooking, and the exact time 
when each dish must be started and 
finished. On entering the kitchen look 
first to the fire and get the heat required; 
second, see that there is boiling water to 
use; third, get out all the supplies needed 
for the cooking; foiuth, begin the cook- 
ing according to the schedtde of time 
for each dish; fifth, with the help of a 
large tray, carry to the dining-room the 
dishes, silver, glass and Unen for the 
table or get these from the china closet 
and buffet. The table may be set dur-

world that can be eaten enjoyably like 
an apple in the raw state. There is 
no puckery quality; it has a delicious 
flavor. It will cook tender in a few 
minutes and retain this unequaled flavor. 

Of cotu-se, this quince can be used in 
the many ways that other quinces can 
be cooked, in preserves, puddings, con- 
fections, ices, etc. The quince is a very 
ancient fruit , taking its name of cydonia 
from Cydonia in Greece. 

This quince resembles in form and 
size the Orange Quince , but it is sweeter 
and more globular and a lighter yellow. 
The average weight is about three 
quarters of a pound, each. 

Tarragon 

TARRAGON is a hardy plant with 
narrow little grasslike leaves of no 
marked beauty; but often found useful 
for foliage in light arrangments of 
flowers. 

It may be wise to inform many that 
roots must be secured. Seedsmen do 
not sell tarragon seeds. In the Decem- 
ber Delineater an article on herbs in 
cookery by Louise Rice mentions that 
the roots are used for making the vin- 
egar. But this is not the general prac- 
tice according to all available author- 
ities and botanists. Probably the stress 
laid upon securing the roots, whereby 
to grow the plant at all, made it seem 
as if that were the valued part for infus- 
ing in vinegar; the leaves are very 
strong and fine flavored, almost too 
much so, since to many the odor is not 
as pleasing as the flavor. 

In an increasing number of recipes 
tarragon is mentioned and always in 
foreign books by noted authorities and 
epicures. 

A few drops of tarragon vinegar im- 
proves mayonnaise, and is fine on pick- 
led beets; it adds the something laclcing, 
or gives a greater zest. Garlic infused 
with tarragon in vinegar adds a French 
note to the harmony. 

The fresh leaves may be added to 
potato salad, and many other fish sal- 



ads, etc., but always use them in mod- 
eration in salads, "gravies" and "made 
dishes'*. A little goes a long way.

Another nMstake we make is to buy 
cheap imitations which cannot hold 
their own and must soon be replaced. 
Better one good article suited to your 
station in life than a dozen "shoddy" 
ones which satisfy but for a time. 
Plenty of people live shallow, deceitful 
lives , because they want other people 
to believe they possess something which 
they do not. Every one, for instance, 
knows you are a machinist, and a good 
one. People know you earn good wages 
and can afford a pleasant, comfortable 
home and a reasonable amount of the 
luxuries of life, and they respect you 
accordingly, but when you live beyond 
yotu" means and wear or use shoddy 
imitations of what your employer has, 
you do not deceive them for a moment, 
and in their hearts they despise you. 
Never be anything but what you seem. 

Then , again, too many of us are either 
so indolent or so vain that we think 
we must hire others to perform for us 
tasks which we coidd just as well do 
for otirselves. Often this extra service 
means a burden of debt or a going with- 
out a real necessity. The -Lord gave 
you some wonderful nattiral instru- 
ments with which to help yourself. 
Why not use them? 

In many homes, the garbage can and 
the rag bag claim too large a percentage 
of our earnings. Wise calculation, 
thrift and judgment in buying, would , 
in many cases, make the living problem 
a much simpler one. Not infrequently, 
too, "bargain days," "red mark sales," 



MEETtN'G THE PROBLEM OE LlVlMG

and catchy ads draw to themselves 
cash for a collection of adds and ends 
which are superfluous or of little use. 
Learn to resist, even while admiring, 
the attractions of the show window. 
Limit your luxuries to your purse. A 
woman, I once knew, clothed herself and 
two children on an allowance, the equiv- 
alent of that spent by the husband and 
father on luxuries unsuited to his in- 
come and obligations. 

Some other little items, which soon 
mount into large ones, are ice cream, 
candy, moving picttues, theatres, and 
even books, magazines, concerts and 
lectures. Limit your indulgence, and 
the pleasures you do enjoy will be all 
the sweeter. Some people continually 
live in an unhealthy atmosphere of un- 
rest. They think they must always be 
eating and seeing, doing and feeling. 
Not so. If such be your inclination, by 
all means cultivate a more sane and 
higher attitude toward life. 

Again, how few wage earners care- 
fully consider income and outgo. True, 
they know they earn a given salary or 
wage, must have certain .things, and 
desire others, but do not really stop to 
consider where and how they spend. 
If they see a thing and want it, they 
buy. If there is no ready cash, it is 
charged. Now credit is a good and 
useftil thing in its place, but **charge it** 
is a bad habit. Better sit down and 
make a rough draft of what you need 
during the month, together with its 
probable cost. Then allow a reasonable 
amount, each, for the luxuries, contin- 



gencies, and, if possible, the savings 
account. Keep this where you can 
refer to it from day to day, and when 
you have spent everything you can 
honestly afford, deny yourself until 
such time as your circumstances will 
permit further expenditure. All but 
the most meager incomes can save 
something. If your income will not 
cover your outgo, curtail expenses to 
meet that income or go where your in- 
come will at least provide for your needs. 
Do not starve or freeze: neither is 
economy. 

In conclusion, permit me to say: be 
thrifty, not niggardly; be generous, 
but just, in your giving; study ways and 
means; keep tab on the little things, 
as well as on the large ones; use common- 
sense and judgment in your buying; 
do not allow your desires to run away 
with your pocket book; and joy in God's 
free pleasures, as well as in man's ex- 
pensive ones; live where you can afford 
to; wear clothing that is serviceable, as 
well as beautiful; pay such prices as you 
can affgrd for what you buy; purchase 
nothing just because your neighbor does; 
cutivate your morai and intellectual 
faculties; worship God in sincerity and 
in truth; in brief, so resolve the high cost 
of living that of itself it will no longer be 
a problem, but instead only a phase of 
the high cost of living, a something 
which can be regulated largely by your- 
self ; and, finally, win from life its sweet- 
est and noblest and best, because into 
it you have put the highest and best of 
yourself.

Beetroot Broth (Fillippini) 

Boil four red beets fifteen minutes; 
remove the skins and slice the roots 
into a saucepan; add two pounds of 
chopped shin^f beef, one sliced carrot , 
one sliced onion, two leeks, two branches 
of parsley, one branch o£ chervil, two 
bay leaves and two cloves; pour into 
the pan three quarts of water and sea- 
son with two teaspoonfuls of salt and 
half a teaspoonful of pepper; mix well 
and let slowly come to a boil, then keep 
simmering two hours; remove from the 
fire and strain through a double cheese 
cloth. Serve at once. 

Barsh a la Polonaise (Deliee) 
Rasp or pound a dozen red beet roots; 
put them into a stone jar with four 
quarts of cold water and a pound of r>-e 
bread crumbs, cover with a cloth and the 
jar cover and put in a warm place to 
ferment for a week. 

Put into a soup-kettle two pounds of 
beef, a knuckle of veal, a duck, half a 
pound of salt pork, foiu" smoked sau- 
sages, salt, a gallon of w^ter and the 
water drained from the beets; set to 
cook, skimming well; add a carrot, an 
onion, two leeks, a bunch of parsley, 
three cloves, allspice and pepper covers; 
let simmer gently, taking up the sau- 
sages, pork, duck, and beef as each is 
done; let the rest simmer another hour, 
then skim off all fat and strain the broth 



Filets of Soles, Veronique 

Remove the filets from a sole; trim 
all to the same si-ze and shape, with 
pointed ends; fold each filet in the mid- 
dle, to make half length ; if desired each 
filet may be folded over a cubical 
strip of raw potato, thoroughly buttered. 
The potato is removed before serving 
and its use adds to the appearance of 
the dish. Butter a dish suitable for 
the table and in this set the prepared 
filets, each separately. To the bones 
and trimmings of the fish add half an 
onion, sliced, three branches of parsley, 
three slices of carrot, juice of one-fourth 
a lemon, half a cup of white wine and 
about a cup of cold water; cover and 
let simmer half an hour after the boil- 
ing point is reached; strain this broth 
over the filets and let them poach very 
gently about fifteen minutes. Lift out 
the filets, cover them and keep hot; 
reduce the liquid to the consistency of 
a thin syrup, and gradually beat into 
it three tablespoonfuls of butter and 
salt to season; pour this over the fish, 
set back into the baking dish to leave 
an open space in the center. Set the 
dish in a hot oven that a glaze may 
form on the fish. When ready to serve 
set a pyramid of skinned and very cold 
muscatel grapes in the center of the 
dish.

stewpan to reheat; cut half the pork and 
part of the beef in small pieces, the 
sausages in thin rounds, and the meat 
of the duck in small collops; put these 
in the soup-tureen with a dozen, small, 
beef, sausage-meat balls, previously fried, 
and two boiled beets, cut in small 
shreds; pour over the boiling broth. 
The broth should have the tint and 
limpidity of claret wine.

in Mrs. Hill's School last summer; the ones 
wrapped in waxed paper." 

Choice Caramels 

1 pound sugar (2 cups) i pound butter (1 cup ) 
1 pound glucose (i cup) 1 pint cream 

Reserve one cup of the cream; put 
the rest of the ingredients over the fire 
to cook; stir until boiling throughout; 
then gradually stir in the rest of the 
cream. Let boil, stirring each three or 
four minutes, until the thermometer 
registers 250 degrees F. (pretty-firm 
''hard ball") Stir in one teaspoonful 
of vanilla extract and turn into two 
brick-shaped bread pans, carefully but- 
tered. The candy should make sheets 
about three-fourths an inch thick.

recipe is written for glucose; when using

Query 2141. — "Recipe for Molasses Dough-

sound right." 

Molasses Doughnuts 

The recipe for malasses doughnuts 
referred to is the only one at hand. We 
see nothing wrong with this recipe. 
The doughnuts are not rich, but, if the 
milk be tmskimmed, the doughnuts 
are not tough; a second yolk of egg or 
a teaspoonful of shortening might be 
added. The milk must be thick and 
sour. 



Query 2142. — "If Viscogen be added to con- 
densed or evaporated milk, can the milk be then 
whipped to the stiff consistency of a double cream 
when whipped?" 

Whipping Condensed Milk 

We are imable to say . whether the 
use of viscogen would enable one to 
whip condensed or evaporated milk in 
the same manner as cream is whipped. 
Probably the milk could be put into a 
condition for use in Bavarian creams, 
or as a garnish for desserts, but we 
doubt if it could be made firm enough 
to hold its shape for use with pastry 
bag and tube.

Bread." 

Boston Brown Bread

1 cup corn meal 
1 cup flour (either 

white or whole wheat)

1 cup raisins, if de- 
sired 



Sift together the dry ingredients. 
Crush and sift the soda before measur- 
ing, then sift into the other dry ingred- 
ients. Return the bran (freed of any 
refuse) to the ingedients that have 
passed through the sieve; add the other 



ingredients and mix thoroughly; turn 
into two well-buttered molds (pound 
size empty baking-powder boxes are 
convenient) and steam three hours. 
Use cold water to fill the steamer, and 
the mixture will have opportunity to 
rise before starting to cook. Replenish 
with boiling water. The water should 
boil continuously for two hours. Set 
to cook with all the water the steamer 
will allow; the supply will not need to 
be replenished during the cooking.

We think it extremely doubtful that

this reason, probably, it is almost im- 
possible to boil brown sugar and milk 
together without having the milk sep 
arate. The substance that then cHngs

solid portions of the milk.

Salt in Boiling Vegetables 

The use of salt in cooking vegetables 
is worked out with much care tinder

are set to cook in boiling water. In 
general salt should be added to the 
water in which all vegetables except 
those containing much cellulose (as 
tiuTiips and parsnips) are set to cook. 
We see no good reason why the addition 
of salt should be delayed ten minutes.

The Art of Living Long. By LuiGi* 
CoRNARo. Cloth. Price $2.00. 
Milwaukee: William F. Butler. 

This is a curious and remarkable book 
of a remarkable mian, — the celebrated 
Venetian Centenarian. It contains the 
Treatise of Comaro on the Art of Living 
Long, with illuminating essays by Joseph 
Addison, Lord Bacon, and Sir William 
Tempte. Comaro's rules of living are 
based on ''temperance in eating and 
drinking." These rules remain tuiim- 
peachably correct, and in the future 
can only be elaborated and perfected. 

This book, containing a minute ac- 
count of his method of living — a work 
he finished at the age of ninety-five — 
has been translated into all ctiltivated 
languages, and will ever be estimated as 
a classic and a standard. He is the only 
man who, at the end of a century, ever 
wrote — was ever able to write — a 
statement, authoritative because based 
upon experience, of the means by which 
others could enjoy the tmspeakable 
delights of a long life of iminterrupted, 
perfect health. There is ample warrant 
for this statement: "No man or woman 
ever fails to enjoy physical happiness, 
whose life is constantly ordered in ac- 
cordance with Comaro's teachings." 
To-day thinking men and women every- 
where are trying to conform more and 
more to Comaro's salutary rules for 
attainment and preservation of health. 

*' Health and Longevity Through Rational 

Diet,'' By Dr. Arnold Lorand. 

Price, $2.50 net. Philadelphia: 

F. A. Davis Company. 

This is an important and valuable 

work. The subject, it may be noted, 

is equivalent, at least, to that of Cor- 

naro, who wrote three hundred years 



ago, but it is here treated in a thoroughly 
scientific manner by one who is versed 
in modem investigation and research. 

The book is translated from the original 
German. The author is a noted prac- 
titioner at the world's oldest health 
resort, Carlsbad. The book is free from 
the fads which render so many books, 
written on the subject for the laity, 
harmful. The highest scientific auth- 
orities have been consulted and their 
researches made comprehensible to the 
non-professional. Diet in relation to 
health is carefully treated from ever>' 
point of view and made intelligible. 
Certainly, if proper nutrition is essential 
to health, a correct knowledge of food 
values is indispensable. For mothers, 
housekeepers, everyone interested at all 
in dietetics, this volume provides most, 
timely and valuable instruction. 

For the general reader we are aware 
of nothing on the subject of diet supe- 
rior to this work. Scientific in treat- 
ment, the practical experience of the 
author renders the contents readable 
even to the point of interest. We find 
here a fund of information — a work of 
constant value.

The New Alinement of Life. By Ralph 
Waldo Trine. $1.25 net. New 
York: Dodge Publishing Company. 
Of this book a late reviewer says: 
"Every reader familiar with Mr, Trine's 
works will ask at once, how does "The 
New Alinement of Life" compare with 
"In Tune with the Infinite?" To those 
who fell under the spell of the earlier 
work the memory of its power remains 
a cherished possession. The appeal of 
the book was unique. It caught up and 
carried on the Emerson tradition when 
that tradition needed most to be carried 
on. People engrossed in scientific dis- 
coveries and- commercial expansion were 
on the point of forgetting that there 
might be a spiritual side to life. Mr. 
Trine performed a remarkable service 
in insisting on the claims of the spirit 
in man. On this account, it is hardly 
just to compare the two books. Scien- 
tific discoveries have altered many of 
our points of view,. and have in tbem-

selves done much to spiritualize even our 
material life and its problems. On this 
account the great work to be done to-day 
is to "aline" our life with the new worid 
as we sense it, and to show how this 
alinement must proceed is the task Mr, 
Trine set himself in the present volume. 
His aim he accomplishes in a most 
efficient way, and his latest work to-day 
must be fully as valuable as that earlier 

The content of this book is in keeping 
with the thought of the day. If there 
be gain in knowledge of truth, we must 
accept it. Civilization means looking 
forward not backward. A philosophy 
of life is an important matter; what is 
your philosophy? Every chapter in 
this book is suggestive of thought and 
indicative of how much of conduct and 
character is dependent on our ways of 
thinking. Thoughts are self-controlled 
and formed into habits. As we think, so 
we become. To many an inquirer of a 
philosophy of life, this book will be 
helpful.

Bolton, A. B. Cloth. 12ino. 
Illustrated. Price, $1.00 net. Bv 
maU, $1.10. New York: Funk 
& Wagnalls Company. 

The book should be useful to Physi- 
ctans in prescribing exercises for their 
patients, to teachers of gymnastics for 
class and private work, to the college 
woman who has left gymnasium days 
behind, and to women everywhere who 
desire physical grace and power and the 
mental satisfaction consequent upon 
both. 

The book contains helpful suggestions 
on matters directly and indirectly re- 
lated to exercise and development, and 
an appendix with a wider range of work, 
briefly tabulated, for the use of teachers. 
It contains numerous illustrations giving 
details for mat exercises. 

Evidently this manual of physical ei- 
ercise has been thoughtfully planned out 
and prepared by a teacher of culture

tion the devoted mothers who spend 
so much of their lives on uncomfortaWe 
camp-stools in the parking on upper 
Broadway, in vacant lots and any 
place where a patch of green or a. little 
space presents room enough for a baby- 
carriage and its occupant. 

"Shall I have to sit on a camp-stool 
all day and embroider or read maga- 
zines," I asked myself, "so my baby 
can get the fresh air he should have?" 

Then, having full knowledge of my 
circumstances, I began a close inspec- 
tion of my environment. Just outside 
the south window of my bed-room was 
a big fire-escape, and, fortunately, the 
hole was outside my next-door neighbor's 
window. Here was fresh air a plenty, 
and much cleaner air than that of the 
dusty streets. Here, top, was sun- 
shine and quiet, and here my baby, 
from his fourth week until his four- 
teenth month — that being his present 
mattu-e age — has spent much of his 
time. 

He was an October baby, and all 
winter, even on the coldest days, he 
slept in his basket on the smmy fire- 
escape, dressed in an eider-down robe, 
with the head covering attached, cov- 
ered warmly and protected by an en- 
ormous umbrella. And right here, let 
me tell any one who wishes to profit by 
my example to purchase the cheapest 
tmibrella she can find. They are made 
for protection from the elanents, but 
none of them will stnad for long cod- 
tintial exposure to the weather. They 
spUt, ctu*! up, expose their ribs and dis- 
card their bandies, and do all kinds of 
unexpected things, after being anchored 
to a baby-basket for a couple of months. 

When the weather became warm, my 
husband made an awning of green denim, 
which worked on a pulley and pro- 
tected the baby from the hot sun, but 
I f otud that during the summer months 
the heat on the metal fire-escape was 
too great in the afternoon, so our son 
had his morning nap there and his 
afternoon nap inside — after which he 
was taken to the park. .

Stuffed Onion and E^-Plant 
Parboil the onions or eggj^ant until 
suitable for stuffing, and then cut out 
the center and fill with the cheese and 
egg-mixture given above and set in the 
oven to bake. In both cases mix tbt 
center part that is scooped out with the 
cheese and raw egg. Finish by baking 
.with buttered crumbs on top. 

Raviolis 

Make a needle dough and dot it evenly 
with the foregoing spinach, cheese and 
egg mixture. Cover with another piec« 
of dough rolled out well, then with a 
glass cut out each ravioli. Have some 
chicken broth boiling and drop the 
raviolis in, one by one, like dumplings, 
and cook for half an hour .boiling quickly. 
In the meantime one must have some 
gravy from a pot roast of be^. Put 
about a pound and half of beef in a pot 
with some suet, and add a little water, 
but not to cover it; add garlic and a 
teaspoonful of the thick tomato paste 
found in all Italian groceries; the paste 
must be dissolved in a Uttle water, it 
is caller Pomidoro, and is very inex- 
pensive and useful for tomato soup, or 
sauce for fishballs, or chops, etc. 

When the roast is cooked and you 
havearich thick gravy from it, and your 
raviolis are done, you dish them on a 
hot platter covered with grated cheese: 
lift the raviolis, one by one, in a per- 
forated ladle so as to drain them from 
the broth. Lay a spoonful of the trick 
beef gravy on each and sprinkle grated 
cheese over. On this lay another row 
of raviolis and "repeat the gravy and 
cheese, and continue the layers of 
raviolis, gravy and cheese tintil all 
are dished. ' 

The beef may be used another day in 
any preferred way; chicken broth can 
easily be made in the foreign quarter 
of our large cities since parts of a 
chicken may be bought, a leg, wing, or 
even a liver. 

Dried mushrooms are also on sale at 
neat Italian groceries; a quarter of a 
poimd costs about fifteen cents. These

mushrooms, soaked and a.dded to roast 
beef gravy, make an excellent sauce for 
raviolis. 

Fritto 

A very hearty fritto can be made 
from the spinach, cheese and egg com- 
bination used for stuffing meat, only 
for the stuffing but a small quantity 
of spinach is used, perhaps one-fourth 
a peck would be enough to purchase. 
For a fritto take a lai^e quantity of this 
filling, enough to fill a frying pan. Fry 
it in olive oil. When well cooked on 
one side hold a big plate down over the 
frying pan and invert the fritto upon it 
and return it the other side down, to 
cook on that side. This makes an 
excellent hearty luncheon dish. j. d. c. 

Four miners in West Virginia, who 
had established records in the appetite 
line, sighed with contentment and agreed 
that the most appetizing and satisfac-

at a cost of forty-two cents. The meal 
consisted of barley soup, six cents; 
brown stew (meat, etc.), twenty-three 
cents; dumplings, five cents; onions, 
parsley and seasonings, three cents; 
fruit-tapioca pudding, five cents.

For Pure Foods and Household Economy ^ 

It is essential in the making of raised foods that you choose 
[dk a leavener of known purity and uniform strength— one that 
not only raises the cake, biscuit or muffin just right, but ' 
that adds something of nutritious value. 

RUMFORD 

THE WHOLESOME 

BAKING POWDER 

restores in part, the nutritious and health-giving properties of 
which fine wheat flour has been deprived, making all home 
baking more nutritious, more easily digested and of better 
flavor and texture. Furthermore, you cannot help but realize 
a saving in money and material by using Rumford.

Since its original publication, Miss Fanner's "Boston Cooking 
School Cook Book" has, in new editions, incorporated large addi- 
tions, but the wealth of new material — the result of experiments 
in the author's classrooms and embodied in recipes which have 
been thoroughly tested — haa grown to such an extent that it has 
become necessary to incorporate it in a separate volume which 
forms an almost indispensable companion to the author's invalu- 
able "Boston Cooking School Cook Book," 

The " New Book of Cookery" contains more than eight hun- 
dred recipes upon alt branches, including many new and import* 
ant dishes not to be found m any other worK. It is profusely 
illustrated.

Our Home Under the Hickories 

By Eleanor W. Coleman 



IT was in a little fishing village that 
we found our home, — a village that 
felt itself neglected by an unappre- 
ciated world: for its neighbors nine 
miles north and south were blossoming 
into stmimer resorts and selling their 
rocky land to city folk for many dollars 
a foot, where it had formerly brought 
but a few dollars an acre. 

The cottage itself, tiny and low- 
pitched, peeping out from a shelter of 
big apple trees, lured us from afar. 
Seeing no one about the place, I ven- 
ttired up the grassy path to the front 
porch, where I lingered, trying to peer 
through the shuttered windows. 

A thicket of hickories screened it 
on the northwest. On the south, a 
meadow drowsed in the sun until it 
lost its way in the shade of an old 
orchard. To the east, was a little 
sweep of tangled grass that made a 
steep drop of sixty feet to the onward 
stretch of the broad Atlantic. 

Again was I lured to the spot with 
my sketching trap. A study of rocky 
headland where the waves dashed and 
broke in foam, and one of the upland 
meadow with dunes and the ocean 
beyond, to say nothing of the red- 
gabled bam peering through the trees, 
was made in the shade and quiet of 
the porches. Day after day found me 
there sketching undisturbed. 



What a delightful spot in which to 
work and rest for a season! 

There was no sign to say that the 
place was for sale or rent, but the tall 
grass and riot of wild things seemed to 
indicate that it had been for some time 
untenanted. Inquiries at the hotel 
brought no help. The apathetic land- 
lord ''Didn't know who owned it," 
in fact * 'didn't know anything about 
it, but there was a cottage to rent up 
the street." Glaringly fresh it was 
in new paint, white with bright yellow 
trimmings, and a red roof. Its stuflfy 
little rooms were redolent of varnish 
and cheap upholstery. It was fitted 
up expressly for the summer people, 
who did not come. 

Patient investigation finally discov- 
ered a leisurely citizen who confessed 
to being the agent of the little cottage 
among the hickories. 

"Yes, it was for rent, — a dollar and 
a half a day." How much by the sea- 
son? He did not know, but could 
give the address of the owner. 

A party from the hotel went to the 
little cottage to inspect it. Quite out 
of the question they decided at a glance. 
Just a little bam - dwelling, — a big 
living room, fair-sized kitchen, two 
bedrooms and a shed. Unwashed win- 
dows and unswept floors, festoons of 
cobwebs from the rafters, and a few

pieces of dilapidated furniture covered 
with dust, — that was all, — yes, it 
was quite impossible, was the full- 
throated chorus. 

But I was not so sure. The big 
double door in the sitting room looked 
out over the ocean and let in an intox- 
icating fragrance, — salt from the sea 
mingled with simsteeped bay, sweet 
fern and briar roses. Every grimy 
window framed in a picture good to 
live with. No plaster in the house, 
not an inch of floor, wall or ceiling that 
could not be reached with soap and 
water, not a crevice where a germ could 
secrete itself from active pursuit, and 
a stillness, broken only by the song of 
a wood pe-wee, mingled with the 
south breeze. 

No, not out of the question at all, 
and I took the owner's name and 
address. A few hours later we were 
in possession. 

I Our first purchase in the village 
store was five pounds of sulphur. The 
worthy who waited on us seemed much 
amused. The sulphur burned itself 
away in the cottage, for thirty-six 
hours, its fumes, meantime, laying any 
ghostly lingerings of former occupants. 

New beds and beddings had been 
put in and the floors scrubbed, but 
when the sulphur had oozed through 



the pores and we entered into active 
possession, every wall and beam and 
rafter was scrubbed with hot suds. It 
was a warm day in June, and ver>- 
pleasant was the smell of the clean wet 
pine drying in the blossom ladened air. 

Some inexpensive couch covers of 
a stamped cotton, from a Japanese 
shop, cost one dollar each. Three or 
four packing boxes, fitted with shelves 
by the village carpenter and draped 
with chintz brought from the city. 
a coat of forest-green paint on some 
pine tables and a wash bench, dark red 
paint and more of the chintz on an 
old settee and the more dilapidated 
of the old chairs, a few bright Japanese 
lanterns, hung in dark comers of the 
rafters, and we had a very habitable 
"camp" at slight expense. 

There were two of us and a maid. 
Luckily our Phyllis loved the countr>-. 
Our meals were served under the hick- 
ories, when the weather was pleasant, 
'and in the shelter of the porch when 
it rained- 

We lived out of doors that summer, 
fairly "Soaking" in the bracing air, 
the beauty and the stillness, and went 
back to town in vigorous condition 
for the winter work and wear. Our 
four months in the little cottage had 
been a success. 



OUR HOME UNDER THE HICKORIES 



After searching from the South Jersey 
coast to Murray Bay and back we had 
at last found what we wanted. Then 
we began to talk about buying it, 
instead of renting another season. 

The price was reasonable, but why 
any one should want it at all, "way 
out in the fields," and so far short of 
standards of gentility, seemed an evi- 
dence of unsound mind. Even the 
thrifty villager, who was paid one dollar 
and a half a day for transplanting wild 
vines, and to add still more sweet briars 
and barberries to the already impene- 
trable tangle, felt called on to protest. 

Before buying the place, we consulted 
with our carpenter who had done sun- 
dry odd bits of work for us during our 
first summer, and had proved honest 
as man and craftsman, and neigh- 
borly withal. He pronounced the house 
well built, solid in foundation and sills, 
and worth additions and improvements. 
After that our September evenings in- 
doors were filled with the excitement 
of plans made, discussed, rejected and 
made over again. 

More windows in the bedrooms, 
and a fire of logs in the sitting room, 
we decided we must have at once. 
The carpenter promised the windows, — 
two big ones, high and wide in each 
room, thrown out on the south slope 
of the roof, opening up to us light and 
breeze and glorious views. But the 
fireplace that was to cheer the chilly 
evenings and make perfect the glorious 
days of north-east storms, here we were 
sorely perplexed. 

We had learned that chimneys could 
smoke and sulk. Rumor even whis- 
pered of one in the neighborhood that 
refused to bum when the front door 
was open. After much serious reflec- 
tion we selected a certain Moses Jede- 
diah Pilkins as the mason who seemed 
to have the most persuasive way with 
chimneys, and I went to him in be- 
coming meekness of spirit. 

The chimney was to be deep and 
wide enough to hold a half-cord length 



NORTHEAST VIEW OF COTTAGE. 

of wood, we had decided, and it was 
to have a draught that would defy 
wind, weather and open doors. 

After seeing it in progress we again 
went north and left Moses Jedediah 
to struggle with his problem unaided. 

We watched eagerly that winter 
for bills. It was only through this 
medium that we could follow the work 
going on for us in the little village by 
the sea. Conscientiously itemized bills 
they were, too, and we became learned 
in the prices and details of building. 
At first, we were sorely piizzlcd over 
such statements as "Teeming brick 
from York," until we remembered that 
in the local vocabularly every four- 
footed thing in harness was a team, 
and that we were seven miles from the 
nearest supply of brick. 

Brick, blue tile, or field stone, had 
been the question that occupied sleep- 
less nights and argumentative days: 
but a certain rich satiny brown, that 
time and closed shutters had wrought 
into the unpainted wood of the walls, 
decided us in favor of the dull red. 

It was all very experimental, this 
building on our own responsibility so 
far from the scene of action. One of 
us was full of faith and buoyant hopes, 
the other shivering with dread, lest

the new windows let in the rain and 
the first fire on the new hearth reduce 
us to ashes. 

We came down in a north-east storm. 
The kindling was damp, the logs, left 
over from the previous summer, were 
water soaked, but in fifteen minutes 
a blaze was roaring up the chinmey, 
warming us to the heart, and settling 
all doubts as to the draft. 

Now the building mania was upon 
us, we wanted another bedroom, and 
a studio was imperative! But there 
were two apple trees, a big balcony 
and a clematis that on no account must 
be disturbed. There must be a high 
studio window, yet the whole effect 
of the building must be kept low and 
sheltered under the trees. Again the 
carpenter was called in and the diffi- 
culties stated He had no suggestions 
to offer, but was calmly confident for 
his own part. 

"You make the drawin's and I'll 
build it," he said, with the added re- 
flection, "The trees'll grow and the 
house won't." 

At last, all difficulties were met. 



A gambrel roof gave a window 12 ft. 
high, with a roof height of 20 feet, 
while a balcony thrown out over one 
end of the studio merged into a room 
that sprang like a low square tower 
from the junction of the studio with 
the main building and was fitted 
into the kitchen roof about half way 
down its southern slope. It was after- 
wards covered with hipped roof. This 
was a difficult piece of work to make 
weather tight, but it was successfully 
carried through without disturbing a 
twig of the big apple tree that thrust 
its fruit within reach of the new win- 
dows, — four of them on the south and 
one on the west. 

During these years our village had 
found itself, and the city folks had 
come. It was already selling its waste 
places for many dollars a foot and 
our little comer of the earth found 
a more appreciative public. Costly 
houses sprang up around us and an 
occasional automobile broke the quiet 
of our lane. The nook under the 
hickories was no longer "way out in 
the fields" and a more retired dining- 



A CORNER IN THE STUDIO. 



OUR HOME UNDER THE HICKORIES 



room became desirable. So a Japanese 
screen was added to the one we already 
have of wild vines and shrubbery that 
closed in the south porch; and it soon 
became our regular dining room. 

In the nearest small town, nine miles 
distant, we found a capable plumber, 
and a good supply of porcelain-lined 
fittings. 

Our house was, at last, literally founded 
upon a rock. Nowhere about it could 
the stick of my sketching umbrella 
go deep enough to hold, though in 
some mysterious way vegetation flour- 
ished. Carpenter and plumber searched 
patiently for a spot where a drain was 
practicable, and, having found it, went 
their ways. I was left to find a man 
to chop through the layer of porous 
rock to the unyielding mass that formed 
its bed below. 

Our water supply came through iron 
pipes from a river deep in the pine 
forest, far from human habitation and 
drainage, and never fails us. It is 
good for drinking and pleasant for 
washing. 

Our shell was now complete. Each 
addition had been made to meet a 
definite need, and our home fitted us 
in aD our modes and habits. Now 
our minds were turned to furnishings. 

The hving-room first claimed atten- 
tion, as we sat by the log fire in the 
evenings of early September. 

Our builder now became interior 
decorator, and fitted one comer near 
the hearth with an open china closet, 
the drawings for which were made 
in a seventeenth century house at 
the other end of the county. 

Very convenient, this, to hold the 
bit of Japanese porcelain, the old 
china of many colors, the brass, copper, 
and pewter one gathers from so many 
places, and that stand for as many 
delightful adventures. 

Very cheery it is, when the fire 
light flashes back from a brightRussian 
Samovor, and plays on the deep greens 
and blues of old dishes, a hint of warmth

and color in a shadowed comer. 

A bookcase, with broad strong shelves 
built into the space between two windows, 
reached to the brown rafters, and the 
two roomy drawers at the bottom 
were fitted with glass knobs bought 
in an antique shop in a distant crty. 

Our color scheme starting with the 
golden glory of the time-colored walls, 
the new hard-wood floor was brought 
to a corresponding tone with a coat 
of dear oak stain that left the grain 
of the wood well marked under two 
coats of varnish. 

More Turkish rugs are on the floor, 
and one of dark grey fur lies before 
the fire place. A pair of old English 
andirons, big and strong, were found, 
after a two years' quest, in the delight- 
ful little shop of an old Frenchman. 
They hold the logs, and in one ingle 
nook, on an old tripod unearthed 
in the garret of a deserted and crumb- 
ling house, sings a brass kettle, and 
in the other, a big copper jar from 
Russia holds a supply of pine cones.

rises in a solid mass to the rafters. 
Droved just the setting for my great- 
grandmother's tea tray, where the hap- 
less Phaeton, in gold helmet and claret 
colored cloak, drives his fiery steeds 
and very expensive chariot, over a

sunbeam in the upper left hand comer. 
Easy wicker chairs are here, and a few 
bits of old mahogany. The room is 
shady and restful, as the breeze sweeps 
through doors and windows on a sum- 
mer day, and it is snug and cozy in 
the fire-glint and lamp light of a chilly 
evening. 

It was the carpenter who built the 
linen closet, reaching from floor to 
ceiling, with compartments to fit the 
different piles of linen. He, too, made 
the boxes with hinged covers, that 
we covered with cow hide and studded 
with brass nails. 

Everything had been of our own 
designing, with much of our actual 
handicraft, and great had been the 



joy in the doing, whUe the expense had 


been absurdly small.

Now we tiuTi gleefully to plans for 
preserving a tangle of Juniper here, 
and curbing the excess of sweet fern 
yonder, arranging a thicket of bar-

It is a perennial task in this world

and an unfailing joy. 



INVITING CORNER ON THE EAST PORCH, 



The Nerve-Cure 



By Gertrude Clark Hanson 



Chicago, March, 1911. 
My dear Katherine: 
J T is more than three months since 
I your letter came and I know that 
•*- you must have wondered, perhaps 
a little resentfully, at my long silence. 
But I am sure that when you have 
heard my tale of woe there will be 
nothing but sympathy in your heart 
for your old pal. 

To put it in plain English, Katherine, 
Fm down and out. IVe fought it off 
all the year, but, yesterday, when I 
went to pieces and cried before my class 
and the supervisor whom I most par- 
ticularly loathe, I knew that it was no 
use trying any longer. I went to Dr. 
Drake and his verdict was sharp and 
uncompromising, "Get out of the school- 
room and out of Chicago and rest abso- 
lutely for a year.*' Sounds easy, doesn't 
it? How could I tell him that I had 
just fifty dollars in the world and no- 
where to go for a year's rest? 

Do you remember the air-castles we 
used to build back in the old college 
days ? It makes me fairly weep when I 
look back. I didn't aspire to the pres- 
idency of my Alma Mater, but I did 
truly hope to do something' worth while; 
and now, behold me, at the end of five 
years, with my college debt barely off 
my hands and nothing to show for the 
years but my fifty dollars and a worn- 
out nervous system. Life has been a 
succession of grades and tests and 
Teacher's Meetings and Supervisors, 
and, in the summers, a special course 
somewhere. 

I didn't mean to whine, but *Im not 
the Jean you used to know, who could 
laugh at anything and see the bright 
side of every worry. I am going to our 
old home town in Ohio where my sister, 
Peggy, is stenographer in a wholesale 
grocery. After I have seen her and 



planned something definite I'll write you 
again. Until then believe me yoiur 
faithful but good-for-nothing chum, 

Jean. 
Fairhaven, O., June, 1911. 
My dear Katherine: 

You have been very patient to accept 
those postals instead of the long letters 
you deserved; and now you are to be 
rewarded, for this epistle is to tell you 
**all about everything" as you so plain- 
tively entreat. 

When I arrived in B — 'the last of 
March, I was too exhausted to do any- 
thing but lie around in Peggy's little 
room while she was away at work. 
Then, finally, one Saturday afternoon we 
took a trolley-ride out to the place 
which was left to us by my grandfather. 
It is a tiny place — only ten acres — 
and is ten miles from town and half 
a mile from the car-line. There is no 
tenant on it this year and Peggy said 
she thought we ought to go and look 
after it a little. It was a beautiful 
April day and the country was so fresh 
and green all along the way. When we 
got to the place. Grandmother's yellow 
Easter flowers were blooming under the 
front window and down by the gate the 
big lilac bush was in bud. The heav- 
enly quiet seemed too good to be true 
and as we sat down on the porch, I 
heaved a big sigh. **If I could only 
spend the year here, Peg," I began, but 
she interrupted me with a quiet, "Well 
why not?" 

She came over and laid her piu'se in 
my lap. **Count it." she said. 

"Seven dollars and twenty-one cents," 
I answered, after a pause, "but what of 
it?" 

"Just this," she answered, "I worked 
hard every day last month from eight 
o'clock till five and, after I had paid for 
my room and board and laundry and 

673 



674

carfare and a few other things, this is 
what I had left to show for it — except 
the trifle I manage to put by each 
month. I've worked seven years and 
I have about three hundred dollars 
saved out of it. How much have you?*' 

**Twenty-eight," I answered meekly. 

''Good!" said Peg briskly, "That 
ought to keep us out here for a year and 
we can camp out beautiftdly." As we 
rode back to town in the dusk she out- 
lined her plans; she insisted that the 
farm idea was an inspiration, but as 
I listened to her carefully laid plans, and 
especially when I found that she had. 
resigned her position, tentatively, a 
fortnight before, I knew that the inspir- 
ation was one of rather long standing. 
But I was in the mood to accept the 
sacrifice gratefully and profit as much 
as possibly by it. 

We brought Grandmother's furniture 
from town, where it has been stored in 
Uncle Ned's attic, and soon we had 
things looking like home. Peg, who 
is business manager, set to work garden- 
ing with the advice of a friendly neigh- 
bor and I help and enjoy it, too. But 
my special charge is a flock of fifty 
motherless chickens, which Peg bought 
of a poultry dealer in town and turned 
over to me to bring up. Say, Kit, do 
you remember the time that Dolly 
Martin came back for re-union and 
brought the twins? She flew around 
distractedly with a harassed frown on her 
face, in one hand a nursing-bottle and 
in the other Dr. Somebody's "Care and 
Feeding of Infants." Well, I'm Dolly 
these days, only my text-book is the 
"Practical Poultry-man". I've lost only 
five and I think they're over the worst 
now. Do you know, I think I'll estab- 
lish a sanitarium for neurasthenics some 
day and give every patient a few lively 
chickens to look after. If a day of that 
exercise doesn't bring refreshing slumber, 
the patient shall be declared hopeless. 

But Peggy has just reported a ripe 
strawberry and I can't talk to you any 
more just now. Don't worry any more 



about me. I'm eating and sleeping and 
working, and I'm happy. 

Jean. 
Fairhaven, September, 1911. 
Dear Kit : 

Once more I must say "Forgive me". 
Many tines I have thought of you, but 
the weeks have been fidl of things cry- 
ing to be done. With this brief apology, 
I'll plimge at once into my quarterly 
report. 

Item 1. Peggy and I have gone into 
business. You will remember that I 
closed my June letter with the announce- 
ment that strawberries were ripe; there 
were not very many for the patch had 
run out, but my child, you should have 
seen the currants and cherries and all the 
rest. When things began to ripen, Peg 
sized up the situation with her usual 
lightning rapidity and like the famous 
Col. Sellers she saw "millions in it". 
So one day she went up to town and 
came back joyful, with a lot of Jelly- 
glasses and jars and a long list of orders 
from leading citizens. We have made 
all sorts of delicious things, for she is a 
bom cook and I have occasional moments 
of inspiration, myself. We work fore- 
noons and rest afternoons and it is not 
nearly so hard as you might, and possibly 
do, imagine. And isn't it fine that I 
can help make money while I'm taking 
the rest-cure? 

Item II. Peggy begs me to state 
that your solicitude as to our social 
life hit her funny-spot. She says it is 
very evident that you have never lived 
on an attractive farm within easy dis- 
tance from a thriving town. To tell 
the truth, we could have a continuotis 
house-party, if we chose, which we don't. 
We have some ideas along that line, 
which I will divulge to you as they 
mature. So far we have been busy 
cultivating our neighbors. They were 
a bit shy of us, at first, but many of them 
knew and loved Grandmother and that 
helped. And then nobody could long 
resist Peg's open-hearted advances. 
There is a little Sunday-school in the 



THE NERVE-CURE 



675 



school-house and we choose to help 
there rather than to pass by it and take 
the car in to town for church. I shall 
go as soon as I feel well enough,but Peggy 
is already established as organist and 
some of the girls are begging for a choir. 
Folks are beginning to drop in, in a 
friendly way, and it is so homey to feel 
that you really have neighbors. 

Supper is ready and I must stop. 
No, Tm not a bit homesick for school as 
you thought Fd be. Jean. 

Fairhaven, December, 1911. 
Dear Katherine : 

It is seven o'clock and supper is a 
thing of the dim dead past. All the 
children in the neighborhood are out 
coasting on Hunter's hill, and, if you 
knew my sister, there wotdd be no need 
to tell you that she is with them, and 
Tm afraid that I, myself, cannot resist 
beyond tonight. After a while they 
will come in and after the cooky jar is 
quite emptied they will practise Christ- 
mas carols for the Sunday-school enter- 
tainment. I am alone with a cheerful 
basebumer and my thoughts. Lonely? 
No, not tonight. It would be folly, 
*! think, to say that I have not been 
lonely at times since confting out here; 
but oh, my dear, the lonliness of the 
country is as nothing compared with 
the loneliness of the crowd. Last win- 
ter, when I was sick and among strangers, 
I used often to say to myself, 
**I care for nobody, no, not I, 
And nobody cares for me.'* 
Of course, I was morbid, but after all 
among all my acquaintances there was 
no one to whom I mattered very much. 

But to go back to tonight; I have 
been busy this evening working up a 
debate on Woman Suffrage for the 
Civics Discussion Club, which meets at 
the school-house on Friday nights. I 
was a bit fussed when they put me on 
the team, but acting on Peggy's prin- 
ciple of being neighborly, I accepted; 
and, being the only woman represented, 
I'm determined to do myself, my sex 
and my subject justice. We got an 



arm-load of books at the City Library 
last week and I have been digging into 
them with Peggy's help. 

I almost forgot one important item, 
namely, my precious chickens have be- 
gun to lay. Don't you envy us our 
fresh eggs for breakfast? And I am 
working up a small private trade in 
town. I ship the eggs by parcel post 
the day they are laid and, of course, 
get the top-notch prices. 

But here come the coasters and there 
will be no more letter-writing tonight, 
With much love Jean. 

Fairhaven, April, 1912. 

We are going to stay for good. Kit, 
and my pen is almost too excited to 
write the news. We were talking over 
our plans last night and we found that 
neither of us could bear to go back. 
Peggy was born for this sort of thing; 
as for me, I am afriad to go back to the 
school-room, and, beside, I don't want 
to. I have been so happy here and am 
so well and strong. And most of all, 
Katherine, it's the home life that appeals 
to me. I am sick of hall-bedrooms and 
boarding-house meals and I want a 
home of my own with Peggy. 

From a business stand-point we've 
made a success of this first year. We* 
have made all expenses and our original 
fund would have remained intact, if 
we hadn't decided that we need a horse 
and wagon. Our hearts cried out for 
a phaeton, but common sense dictated 
a road- wagon; so when you come to see 
us you may go with me to deliver our 
orders. And unless you've changed 
greatly from the Kit I used to know, 
you'll revel in the experience. 

We are going to enlarge the chicken 
business. B — has its first tea-room 
just started and we are to supply the 
eggs and various other things. Peg 
has a lot of new customers added to last 
year's list, so we will be busy and pros- 
perous. We know a teacher in town 
who needs a home for the summer about 
as much as I did last year and she is 
coming to stay with us and help for her 



676

board. So you see, nobody expects to 
work all the time. 

We have lots of plans on foot — house- 
parties from town, week-ends for girls 
who need the change, and lots of good 
times for everybody. We are working 
hard for a County Young Women's 
Christian Association and Peg says that, 



if we can't get it, we'll make one of our 
own. 

We are looking forward with much 
eagerness to June, when you are to 
come and be introduced to our farm. 
Perhaps you, too, will want to stay, 
when you see hoy,^ altogether lovely it is. 
Till then, Goodby, Jean. 



The Marriage of Emily 

By Helen Forrest 



MY niece, Emily, was married to 
the Burton boy at eight, o'clock 
this evening. There was noth- 
ing unusual about the wedding, only a 
lack of the solemnity which seems to 
me to belong to such an occasion. I 
feel that more dignity and less ostenta- 
tion was due my mother's wedding veil 
which Emily wore draped cap-fashion 
over her blonde hair. I could have 
wished the Burton boy a shade less tall 
or Emily a trifle taller, that the difference 
in their height might not have been so 
obvious. I felt that their vows might 
well have been exchanged in a church 
and not in that great reception hall, but 
there is a charm in youthful romance and 
the lovers are so happy that we must 
rejoice with them. 

Oh, the wedding was a credit to my 
capable sister, the bride's mother; it is 
my own position in the matter which 
makes me wakeful. In fact, it is one 
o'clock, and I have been for two hours 
in this comfortable room and I have just 
realized that I am still in my gala gown 
— I haven't even taken, off my gloves. 
Emily is my namesake, I brought up 
her mother, my youngest sister; the 
child is very dear to me, and it has been 
my desire to transmit to her some of 
our ancestral ideals, our literary and 
artistic ambitions, to engraft a touch from 
leisurely Farmington to this charming 
product of a rushing New York suburb. 



Thus it is that I view with a degree of 
disappointment her marriage with the 
Burton boy, whose family country 
place adjoins my home. I cannot share 
the unbounded satisfaction so plainly 
evidenced by the family connection. 
What ideals remain for little Emily, 
so merrily wedded to this cheerful son 
of money-makers, himself a surprisingly 
successful business man. 

And here is my amazing position. I, 
Emily Whittington, am smilingly con- 
gratulated, jestingly greeted as a suc- 
cessful match-nfaker. 

Cousin Mary Pells, always to me a 
most uncongenial addition to our fam- 
ily circle, actually told me she wished 
I would take her daughter abroad and 
find her a Billy Biu-ton. My good 
brother-in-law, whose money overflows 
generously even in my imwilling direc- 
tion, said, **Emily, I can't get over the 
killing fact that it is you and not Emily's 
mother, you, Emily, the dreamer, and not 
Mary, the schemer, who did this thing, 
so good a thing that I won't blame you 
for losing me my little girl." 

Even the Burton boy, when with heart 
and eyes full I was led up to congratulate 
the two over whom the solemn words 
had just been said, lifted me off my 
feet, me, Emily Whittington, kissed me 
heartily and said, **Dear little Aunt 
Emily, you did this for us and we shall 
bless you all our days." 



THE MARRIAGE OF EMILY 



677 



Actually my brain whirls and I have 
been trying to view the facts how and 
where did it come about, and what was 
my part in the marrying of Emily! 

I must stop, just here and forever, the 
habit of referring to Emily's husband as 
the Burton boy. She requests me to 
call him Billy, but I shall compromise on 
William; really he is twenty-five, and 
I should forget the years in which he 
ran through my flower beds and raided 
my fruit trees. He really is and has 
been a good boy ; his spirits have always 
been high. 

Emily's parents had given me freely 
the joy of her presence ; it was first com- 
ing to Grandpa's house, then too soon 
it was to Aunt Emily's house — for 
I was left alone. The Burton boy played 
cond scendingly with her; he is six 
vears her senior, and what bov of four- 
tean cares for a girl of eight ! I remem- 
ber that they broke several windows 
while playing ball ; he was teaching her 
to throw over hand, and she invariably 
failed to catch the ball when it was 
thrown to her. 

He was an only and a lonely boy, was 
Billy boy, how he disliked this name, 
which clung to him even when his little 
boy days were over, and so charming 
a child was Emily that he forgave her 
years. 

It was absurd of the Burtons to have 
their son educated abroad; how seldom 
their big place was opened while Eton 
and Oxford were failing to make him 
an Englishman. I do not know a more 
thorough American than my recently 
acquired nephew. 

But, once more, to attempt an analysis 
of my position as matchmaker, a term 
so suddenly and so gratefully applied 
to me. 

When I asked Emily to visit me in 
June, shortly after her graduation from 
a superficial finishing school, it was my 
hope to stimulate her interest in the 
world of Art, which she and I were to 
enter in the autumn when we should go 
abroad together. I had no idea that 



the Burton boy, by which I mean 
William, was to be at home. 

Emily and I were in the rose garden 
after dinner ; I remember I was speaking 
of Nurnberg and Albrecht Durer, when 
the Burton boy stepped over the hedge, 
greeted me, then, before Icould introduce 
her, turned to my niece and exclaimed 
**Why, you kre Emily!" They hadn't 
met for four years, but she answered 
readily, **And you are Billy!" 

As I look back on that fortnight I 
realize the significance of Williams sud- 
den interest in Art. I frankly admit 
that, at that time, I believed his aesthetic 
nature, hitherto dormant, was experi- 
encing a renaissance. 

He joined us daily while I discoursed on 
my pet subject and, quite in the fashion 
of years before, Billy and Emily became 
fast friends, pla>4ng tennis * 'after les- 
sons" and motoring over the country 
roads. 

I recall, also, the fact that WiUiim's 
presence at luncheon became so acce 3ted 
a fact that I habituallv ordered what 
amounted to an early dinner instead of 
the light luncheon I prefer. 

I imagine his presence at the sailing 
of our boat was due to the fact that he 
called upon me in Farmington sometime 
after Emily's departure and asked me 
when and by what boat we were to sail. 
The fact that my neighbor was on the* 
pier to wish us bon voyage did not seem 
to me significiant, his fruit and flowers 
were like those sent by our other friends. 
I remember, now, that he asked me 
where we should spend our first month, 
but I gave an outline of our itinerary to 
many friends that day, to Billy Burton 
and to others. Cousin Mary Pells* 
suggestion that I had invited him to 
follow us is, of course, unworthy of con- 
sideration. As I remember that morn- 
ing in Dresden, a week after our arrival, 
I find that I have relaxed in my chair, 
with the psychological feeling of rest 
which comes as a reward when one has 
arrived at the solution of ,a mental 
problem. The memory stands firm, in

bright tinting like a Dresden post card. 
How well I have come to know William ; 
.one of his phrases rises predominant in 
my mind, "just here I hit the trail." 

Emily and I had walked. in the bright 
blue weather of October, from the 
friendly Pension where I had so often 
stayed, through the cheerful cosmo- 
politan throng that filled the Reich- 
strasse, down to the The Zwingler, 
Dresden's mighty gallery. Emily walked 
briskly beside me, her golf -trained mus- 
cels give her a springiness of motion 
and seeming tirelessness ; her yellow 
hair crinkled under the edge of her 
Paris hat; her fair face seemed to glow 
with the joy of living. 

I stopped at the entrance, the place 
worn by the feet of pilgrims to this 
shrine of Art seems to me holy ground. 
Emily's words broke in upon my mood. 
*'To think, that horrid August the Strong, 
built this place just to have an arena 
for wild animals to fight. It*s lucky 
for Dresden that he was diverted to 
collecting pictures." 

We turned from the brilliant garden 
and the gray old palace of the Saxon 
kings, and climed the stone stairs of 
the gallery. Before us were two Ger- 
man women conversing in gutteral 
accents, behind us, 1 heard the crisp 
monologue of a French voice ; I brushed 
the shoulder of a Japanese; truly many 
and varied were the worshipers at this 
shrine. 

It was familiar ground ; I went to my 
altar, the red hung room where the 
Sistine Madonna reigns alone, in calm 
majesty; the glory of motherhood shines 
in her face, beyond the child in her 
arms, and blesses her worshipers. 

Emily stood beside me, but I had for- 
gotten her until she whispered, **Well, 
I'm glad I've seen her again, she's one 
of the people you don't get tired of." My 
niece left me and turned into the adjoin- 
ing room. I saw her sit down on one 
of the little couches, blessed of tired 
tourists, she opened the Museum, cata- 
logue, took out her gold pencil and began. 



after her own fashion, to study Art. 
Her charming head, bent over the book 
and absorbed in its contents, proved an 
interesting study to many who had como 
to gaze at pictures of another sort. I 
watched Emily, too, her study of Art 
was in deference to my wishes, the man- 
ner of procedure was an inheritance 
from her father, the business man. 
Emily's method was simple, I had 
observed it. First ascertain what room 
she was in. Room, A, B, C, or what ever 
it might be, then find by the catalogue 
the list of pictures hanging in this room. 
First, examine any picture which Bae- 
deker had marked with a star (his book 
invariably accompanied her), then lo- 
cate by number any picture that espec- 
ially appealed to her, study it a little 
and put a line under it. On reaching 
home it was her little way to go over 
thelmarks made on her latest visit and 
recall silently, or to me, each picture as 
she remembered it. I sighed for my 
lost ideals. Emily was not to dream 
with me, but her system worked well, 
she was assimilating and learning in 
practical fashion as became her father's 
daughter. 

As I watched my niece, a shadow fell 
between her and the sunlight; a man 
was speaking with her, and I hurried to 
her side, all the chaperonc. As I remem- 
ber it, I was not greatly surprised to 
see the Burton boy, and I noted in a 
sort of sub-consciousness that Emily 
seemed to find it the most natural 
thing possible, his sudden presence in 
Dresden. 

Cousin Mary Pells would doubtless 
have been cleverer, but William's ap- 
pearance seemed to me a proof that his 
interest in Art was sincere, that I had 
given him something the Burton mil- 
lions could never have bought, the love 
of Art for Art's sake. He grasped my 
hand with a cordiality which made it 
ache, **Behold Sherlock Hobnes," he 
whispered, **I struck Dresden only an 
hour ago; since then I've located my 
hotel, been to your Pension, found you

were out and promptly came to you here. 
What's more, we went directly to the 
Sistine Madonna, being sure you would 
be in her immediate locality." 

Emily had closed her catalogue, the air 
of the place seemed charged, vitalized. 

**Let's get out of this," said the Burton 
boy, and we went with him, Emily 
close behind him, I following more 
slowly. They waited for me in the open, 
I felt a curious thrill, even the familiar 
fountains, rising ghostlike in sudden 
jets banked in their flower beds, appeared 
to take on a new aspect, I was strangely 
puzzled. 

"Billy boy," I had unconsciously 
reverted to his boyish name and he 
laughed, "I don't understand, how do 
you happen to be in Dresden, how did 
you know our Pension, how are Dresden 
and this gallery so familiar to you?" 

"Let us take it one at a time. Miss 
Whittington ;" again I felt the atmos- 
phere, he was now the Billy Boy of old 
days, trying to make it all right after 
some boyish mischief. Emily my niece 
was strangely silent, her eyes on her 
catalogue. 

"I came to Dresden because you 
people are here; I knew your Pension, 
well, Emily happened to let me know; 
as for Dresden," he laughed quite nat- 
urally, "I spent some three weeks here 
that year I travelled with Sjrmington; 
I had my fifteenth birthday while we 
were here. You remember Symington ?' * 

Remember his tutor, indeed ,1 did, my 
sympathy for that much tried man had 
stamped him on my memory. 

"I know Dresden all right," he went 
on suddenly hopeful, "and if you don't 
mind a little exercise there's something 
I want to show you. It's just here in 
the Coiu-t yard, through that arched 
gate. The Grune Gewolbe, the green 
vaults you know, the Saxon king's 
treasure house." 

We stopped at the deep walled en- 
trance of a vast old building, a guide was 
furnished us, a clever military sort of 
person, an excellent linguist and with 



a huge golden key. He was ready with 
voluble explanations in German or in 
French, his English was more uncertain, 
but he speedily realized that he was 
merely our escort, our guide was Billy 
Burton, who hurried us past garnet- 
studded clocks, wonderful peacocks with 
countless jewels in their tails, the mar- 
velous treasures of the Saxon kings. 
Some day I shall return to enjoy at my 
leisure that priceless -collection, again 
the work of August the Strong. 

William was searching for some- 
thing which he saw on his last, trip and 
which he had remembered for ten years. 
And now he had found it, not even an 
original, merely a copy of the Braut- 
becker of Numberg, a silver drinking 
cup, the quaint figure of a woman, 
short of waist and full of skirt, her little 
arms holding above her head a tiny 
cup which swung on pivots, her bell- 
shaped skirt forming the second and 
larger cup. And now, suddenly, I knew, 
oh ! how blind I had been. The room 
swam before me. 

The guide knew, a knowledge of 
English was not necessary to comprehend 
the look in the eyes of the ffurton boy 
as he lifted the frail cup in his hands 
and went on a trifle rapidly, — "Emily, 
this is the bride-cup ; they used to drink 
out of it after the ceremony ; they must 
drink out of it at the same time to insure 
a happy life. The little cup for the 
girl, the larger one for the man. 

It was sightseeing of the most ordin- 
ary sort; his words might have been 
taken from a guide book, but I knew, and 
the man with the gold key knew, that 
the moment was tense. Emily felt it, 
too, her face was white,, and the Biuton 
boy went on as though he must, — 
"Emily, do you think we could drink 
out of the same cup, you and I? Will 
you?" 

I couldn't have gone, though I turned 
my eyes from the glory in Emily's face. 
The guide turned away, too, but I 
heard her voice — "Billy, I'd like to 
try." 



Breakfast at Eight 

By Quincy Germaine 



WE are six, altogether, — four 
sisters and two cotisins, — 
Greta, Nell, Polly, Jul, Pat, 
and Sue. I am Greta, the oldest of the 
sisters; Jul and Sue are the cousins. In 
age we range from twenty-six to nine- 
teen, in height from five feet seven to 
five feet two, in inverse relation to oiu* 
ages, for I am the shortest, whereas 
Pat and Sue overtop me by a head. We 
all have light brown hair, eyes of vary- 
ing shades of grey-blue, and the reput- 
ation of being the livliest family for 
miles around. By a lucky freak of fate 
our name is Holiday. Our father, who 
is uncle to Jul and Sue, is the country 
doctor, so everybody knows **the Hol- 
iday girls". 

We live in an out-of-the-way hamlet in 
the midst of lovely country, where 
nothing but the seasons ever changes, 
and nothing happens unless we make 
it. Even the trains pass through with- 
out stopping except early in the morn- 
ing, — not counting one that we can 
flag in the evening, — so that anything 
or anybody coming to us generally 
appears with the sun. This was the 
circumstance that caused mother to 
make her famous decision. She would 
specialize in breakfasts. 

** Everybody gives luncheons/' she 
said. ** Dinners are not possible with 
your father's irregular hours. As there 
are not many households where six girls 
can laugh and look pretty at eight in 
the morning pr earlier, breakfast it 
shall be." 

And breakfast it was from that time, 
which was the day of our first invasion, 
following the rettim of Nell and Polly 
from a fraternity Prom and houseparty. 

I had seconded the decision enthus- 
iastically, when mother consulted me, for 
if she plans a thing, she knows how to 



carry it to a triumphant climax. Mother 
was city-bred and had been a 
great belle before her marriage. Father 
always said she knew more about hu- 
man failings than he with his enormous 
practice. But after four years of per- 
fectly marvelous breakfasts we began to 
realize that we had underestimated her 
ability. Alladin and his lamp, Franklin 
and the lightening, Mr. Marconi and 
his Hertzian waves weren't in it with 
mother and her breakfasts. 

When the train whistled at the Junc- 
tion, she would descend the stairs in her 
fresh white pique, glance at the table 
on her wav to the kitchen and remedy 
any oversight of the one who had set 
it half an hour before Then she would 
appear in the door, smile at the daughter 
or niece who was serving her turn that 
morning, and — well, somehow, by 
the time the expected guest was on the 
porch, being greeted by the one he had 
come to see, the coffee was steaming, 
the toast and muffins brown, waffles 
ready for the iron, eggs, tomatoes, chops, 
or bacon on the platter, and mother was 
in her place at the head of the table, 
just as cool and fresh as when she had 
come down the stairs. When our gu^t 
had scraped ever5rthing but the pattern 
from his plate, — our guests were al- 
ways men, for the girls who came stayed 
so long we called them part of the family, 
— she would suggest a walk in the gar- 
den or a visit to the bees. I believe, if 
she had asked him to wash the windows, 
he would have obeyed with equal alac- 
rity. 

No one could eat one of mother's 
breakfasts and remain on solid groimd. 
He was simply transported As proof 
of it, I know for a fact that fifteen men 
have proposed in the garden after one 
of those feasts, — not all together, oi

BREAKFAST AT EIGHT

course, or at the same time, but scattered 
along at respectable intervals in the 
four years and among the six girls. 
'Fifteen men** sounds like two apiece 
and three over. In reality, it was three 
apiece, with me left over. My first and 
only proposal came and was accepted 
before the other girls had received any 
of theirs. The man, in my case, was way 
out West in a mine, and I had been 
waiting six years in hope of his being 
sent to a place where I could go,too. 
The night Henry Fiske telephoned Jul 
that he would be with us for breakfast 
in the morning, I was feeling pretty blue. 
No letter from the West had reached 
me for nearly two weeks, so I welcomed 
some excitement to keep me from worry- 
ing. 

It was my turn to help in the kitchen 
that week, therefore, I was the first one 
up next day. As I unlocked the front 
door and stepped out into the warm 
July sunshine, I almost fell over a man 
sitting on the edge of the porch. 

"Good morning," he said, rising to 
about six feet of blondness, **is Miss 
Holiday at home?" 

He wasn't Henry — of that I was 
sure. I had seen Henry plenty of times. 
This person was a perfect stranger. 

"Which Miss- Holiday?" I asked, 
after some seconds of frantic 'thought. 
The question was so habitual that I 
didn't realize I had spoken till I heard 
the familiar words. 

He looked scared. 

"Miss — er — Ellen ? — er, Eleanor — 
She was called Nell," he stammered. 
"We visited the Bradley s in the same 
party. My name is Parker. I was 
passing through here on a business trip, 
and meant to wait at the hotel till a 
decent hour — " 

"And foimd there was no hotel," 
I interrupted, sorry for his embarrass- 
ment. "Won't you come in? I'll call 
her. All our friends come at this hour. 
The morning trains each way are the 
only ones we have." 

I left him in the parlor, somewhat com- 



forted, and flew for Nell. Polly, who 
was up by that time, promised to help 
me. We were already putting another 
plate on the table when Nell descended 
the stairs, her bangles clanking, as 
usual, with every move she made. 

"We might have expected this," 
Polly remarked, as Mr. Parker's voice 
reached us from the parlor, "a holiday 
in the middle of the week always means 
an extra." 

"Holiday of Holidays," I answered, 
quoting father's favorite remark. Just 
then the bell rang. "There's Henry 
now. Let him in, will you?" I added. 

Polly dashed out but was back in a 
second, wide-eyed. 

"He wants Pat," she exclaimed. "I 
put him on the side porch. He's that 
Mr. Beech who was here Washington's 
Birthday." 

"They both must have come on the 
first train," I reflected. "Tell Pat, and 
call Sue to help us. There's the down 
train whistling now. See if mother is 
ready." 

Mother came in as Polly went out. 
We put on our pink aprons while Pat's 
heels were clattering down the stairs, 
and we heard her laughter greeting Mr. 
Beech on the side porch. Then Polly 
rejoined us, with Sue. 

"Isn't this thrilling!" crowed the 
later. "I'll take off some honey if you 
say so. The hives are full." 

"Yes," agreed mother, "and Polly 
must get some more sweet-peas. That 
big table needs plenty of flowers." 

"Keep an eye out for Henry," said I, 
as they went out the door. Sue obscured 
in her bee- veil. "Jul isn't down yet." 

Jul was down the next minute. She 
always dawdled on the top stairs and 
came over the rest with a run. This 
morning the run extended to the kit- 
chen, where she arrived, breathless. 

"Guess what Henry's bringing," she 
announced. "I saw them from my 
window. The Coolidge twins!" 

"Where are they now?" demanded 
mother.

''Coming across the fields slowly. 
They'll be here in five minutes." She 
went back toward the front of the house, 
pausing at the door to ask, "Breakfast 
at eight, as usual?" 

** Breakfast at eight, though the sky 
falls," answered mother, a trifle grimly 
for her. 

**Such a thing wouldn't be surprising,'' 
I returned, putting the waffle-iron on the 
stove. **It's lucky we're used to emer- 
gencies!" 

"This isn't an emergency," she cor- 
rected, bending to look at the muffins, 
"it's melodrama. All that is lacking is 
an irate father and a villian to carry off 
the heroine." 

*.*If your villian is coming to breakfast, 
he'll have to walk or fly. There's no 
train this side of the Junction till night." 

"Unless your father finds him, help- 
less, by the roadside," she reminded, 
referring to an incident that had become 
a byword. 

"Cheer up, mother! You might for- 
give him after all this time. It proved 
to be only a sunstroke, you remember," 

"A young man delirious in the house 
with six giris is something I cannot for- 
give." 

"But after that experience," I re- 
sponded, "even a kidnapping villian 
would be tame. However, I'm the 
only heroine at leisure and I'm likely to 
stay right here for a little while." 

She shook her head at the way I said 
that. I was feeling pretty lonesome 
with all those men for breakfast and the 
other girls so excited. It isn't much fun 
to hang over a waffle-iron for other 
people's beaux, after going without a 
letter for ten days. Before I could fol- 
low up my grievance. Sue dashed in with 
the honey and flowers, snatched off 
her bee- veil and exclaimed, 

"Henry Fiske and the Coolidge twins! 
Uncle's coming down the road. Break- 
fast right away?" 

"Breakfast at eight," answered mother 
glancing at the clock. It pointed to 
twelve minutes of the hour. 



"Give father five minutes, " I sug- 
gested, "he deserves it. He's been to 
that menengitis case over at the Junc- 
tion." 

She went to the window as father 
drove into the yard and went by to the 
bam. When she turned round she 
looked, — for the first time in my life, 
anyhow, — absolutely stem. 

"Not five minutes, nor even one,'' 
she said firmly. "Breakfast will be at 
eight and he must be ready. Your 
father has brought somebody with him." 

"Enter the villian," I retorted as I 
laid still another place on the elongated 
table. "I guess you're right, mother. 
This is the finish of the heroine. Six! 
Whew!" 

Sidewise, through the window, I could 
see Pat and Mr. Beech on the porch. 
Beyond them, out by the grape-arbor, 
Jul, Sue, and Polly were standing with 
Henry and the twins. The girls all 
had on white dresses, and the whole 
crowd had been decorating one another 
with roses. Presently they began a 
battle with the flowers and their shrieks 
of glee brought Nell and Mr. Parker 
out of the house. 

"Greta," said mother. 

I roused with a guilty start. 

"Go, call you father." She pointed to 
the clock. Everything was ready except 
the waffles, and she poured the first of 
those on the hot iron as she spoke. 
"Hurry. I'll be taking things in." 

I hurried. Anything to get away 
from that bridal-looking bunch on the 
lawn. Without even taking off my 
apron, I ran, down the path, out by the 
apiary and chicken-houses, toward the 
barn where the automobile was still 
chug-chugging. Father met me at the 
door. He was smiling, and the twinkle 
in his eye was not what I had expected 
to see, after his being out all night. 

"Breakfast at eight," I said briefly. 

"Room for one more?" he inquired, 
jerking his head toward the gloom of 
the barn. "I picked him up over at the 
Junction." 



THE GARDEN OF EDEN

Then a man came forward into the 
light. 

"A villian, to carry off the heroine." 
Mother's words flashed through my 
mind. Flashed, — that was all. Every 
other thought was swept away when I 
saw his face. I just stared and stared. 

The man coming to me out of the 
shadows of the barn was the one who 
had been out West six long years, who 
had kept me waiting for a letter ten 
interminable days. He found me in the 
barnyard, in a pink apron, and with my 
face all hot from getting breakfast for 
other girls* beaux ! 

When my powers of speech and action 
returned, I stammered out one word, 
** Waffles!" Grabbing his hand for fear 



he might vanish again as suddenly as 
he had come, I started on a dead run for 
the back door. 

The bridal party was still whe're they 
had been before, but broken into couples 
now and scattering through different 
paths of the garden. At the door, when 
we reached it, was mother, calm as 
usual, but with an odd and subtle smile. 

*'Waffles," I mumbled, conscience- 
stricken, but not half- as sorry as I 
should have been. 

She hesitated only an instant, while 
her smile (which was always serenely 
sweet) grew broader. 

"The waffles are done and eaten," 
she said. "Breakfast was at eight. It 
is now quarter past nine." 



The Garden of Eden 

By Mrs. Charles Norman 



THE Garden of Eden, of which I 
would tell you, does not lie in the 
valley of Euphrates, but a few 
miles back from the Ohio in an ordinary 
piece of ground at the rear of a dwelling. 
It contains no marks of beauty, is sur- 
rounded by no picturesque wall or bow- 
ers of verdure. It is a plot of earth, 
nothing more: and yet it is distinctly 
remembered that early last summer, 
when the owner of the ground disap- 
peared and was sought — he rose in the 
midst of the garden in a manner sug- 
gesting a resurrection, and called out 
solemnly: "This is Paradise". 

All that Paradise contained, at that 
time, was a few lines of something green- 
three different shades, pea green, lettuce 
green and onion green; very youthful 
products, fresh and clean! Yet Eden 
actually existed for that man; for the air 
was sweet, the birds were singing, the 
soil was mellow,the weeds had not begun 
their growth, and the man had a hoe and 
was helping Nature perform her mira- 
cles. It was plain to see how the magic 
worked, 



I wish I could go on and tell you more 
of this talc without hearing the sneers of 
those earth-born mortals who scorn 
Mother Earth. But I hear them and I 
see the smile of the cynic and some highly 
"practical" individuals who demand to 
know how the man's garden turned out. 
I will be very bold to answer that ques- 
tion, that in my opinion it turned out 
when the worker began to feel good. 
It seems to me a highly sensible thing 
to cherish every moment of bliss and to 
open every avenue to true happiness. 

But if anyone desires mc to admit that 
this man's Eden was only partially sat- 
isfying and not all a garden might be — 
I willingly concede it. This, however, 
is only the negative side, and everyone 
knows that expert gardeners have spent 
years at their job. 

Nevertheless, the garden had turned 
out before any products were carried 
into the kitchen or the potatoes were 
dry. The Garden of Eden was not a 
market garden, and this article is not 
intended as a farmer's guide. There 
are many rational people bravely doing 



684 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



their tasks in cities and getting along 
the best they can with narrow quarters 
and missing the restorative contact 
with nature. It is they, to whom I 
would send hope. There are many 
persons in smaller cities who are not 
utilizing the soil to which they have 
access, are not adding anything to the 
productivity or beauty of the earth or 
learning any of the wholesome truths 
it teaches. 

I read in the newspaper of a com- 
pressed apartment house — something 
new and terrible, which the urgency of 
the times has made possible and the 
genius of the city has evolved from its 
seething brain. It is something which 
will squeeze people a little more — 
a rent-reducing, space-saving contri- 
vance, a sort of patent by which one 
small room is, by push-button process, 
convertible into a dining room, a parlor, 
or a bed-room. This room, boudoir, 
presence-chamber and refectory, all 
in one, is, with the addition of a chafing 
dish, all that is needed for a small 
family. Oh, you who have a sense of 
humor, imagine a large family in a 
case like that! But large families are 
not conceivable, at present. 

When I read of the compressed apart- 
ment, I got up and paced the floor, 
until, by the law of the suggestion of 
opposites, there came to my mind the 
line from Genesis: 

"And they heard the voice of the 
Lord God, walking in the garden in 
the cool of the day.'* 

But hCf the man in the compressed 
apartment, did not walk in the garden! 
I knew that. Neither did his wife — 
for the worst feature about compressed 
apartments is that its occupants are 
not only compressed indoors, but out. 
If this man and woman walked any- 
where, it was to the corner to catch 
a car — and more likely they ran. 

Do you wonder I wish to speak of 
gardens, when I think of the huddling 
in tenements, the huddling in flats, 
the great rows of buildings set squarely 



against the street, and the vast and ever- 
increasing multitude who can never 
hear the voice of the Lord God as he 
walks in the garden in the cool of the 
day? 

But gardening is said to be the fash- 
ion now, and there is some evidence of 
this in the splendid array of new books 
on that subject. Even the seed cat- 
alogues are assuming such fine appear- 
ance that, after their spring arrival, 
they haunt otu* dreams. Our first one 
came, this year, on January 20, and 
helped to mitigate the discomfort of 
snow and ice. **If winter come, can 
spring be far behind?" we asked; and 
we proceeded to make out our lists and 
spend evening after evening planning 
that wonderful garden of dreams which 
— it must be admitted — bears little 
resemblance to any we have actually 
had. 

As a matter of fact, a wild-fiowcr 
garden has been my mania — but our 
place is wholly unsuited, being sunny 
and dry. On this point and others 
I have been determined to the point 
of stubbornness — idiocy maybe. I was 
bound to raise asters and labored \^-ith 
them for three years, with the idea 
that it was ignomy to fail; but in spite 
of my careful mixtures of "sand and 
lime and well-rotted stable manure'', 
they were nothing. On the other hand, 
tulips have been the glory of our hill: 
dahlias have been a surprise and a 
delight, and zinnias, with no care save 
that they were thinned, made a stronsj 
hedge as high as my head. Tell mc 
that I will discard zinnias for something 
less coarse, when my taste improves' 
I will not forsake my best friend — 
a flower that has given us a great mass 
of fine color through June, July, August 
and September. This year my heart 
is set (and my hand also) on tall stalks 
of blue larkspur. But I have decided 
not to be too foolish, but to take the 
advice of an old gardener who said: 
"Have what you want in your garden, 
if you can. If not, have what you can/' 



THE GARDEN OF EDEN 



685 



Even a dull person will eventually 
learn some things. It was my idea that 
vegetables and flowers should grow 
side by side, and they can do it — but 
there are difficulties. You know the 
old jingle about a garden well - tilled, 
a wife well-willed and a table well 
filled? It has more truth than poetry. 
It passes belief how much help a small 
garden may be, and how superior the 
vegetables — if they are fresh. Does 
it not sound well, too, to hear of a wife 
going to the garden in the evening and 
picking strawberries or red raspberries 
for breakfast? 

But, if possible, let us have a space 
somewhere for flowers. **The beau- 
tiful is as useful as the useful *' 

'*Rose plot, 

Fringed pool 
Fem'd grot, 

The veriest school 

Of Peace; and yet the fool 
Contends that God is not. 

Not God! In gardens when the eve is 
cool? 
Nay, but I have a sign; 
*Tis very sure God walks in mine." 

You will indulge me in this much 
poetry, observing that, for the most 
part, I have de^lt only with every-day 
things. I have not urged pergolas and 
marble statues and fountains and devices, 
such as the Italians use with pleasure 
to themselves and delight to others. 
The Italian knows his need of fresh 
fruits and vegetables, and he knows his 
need of beauty and provides for it 
with remarkable cleverness. The most 
unfortunate environment is made home- 
like. A ditch, which in our country 
would have no utility, save to receive 
tin cans and old shoes, easily becomes, 
by bridges and arches and vines, a 
retreat to the Italian familv. Little 
walled-up spaces at the rear of the 
house, no landscape to them, just dear, 
individual, private plots of ground — 
these even the poorest enjoy. 

I took a rail-way journey last summer 



across three states and I saw only two 
places, in all the towns, where it seemed 
one could sit down out-doors comfort- 
ably, and in private, and enjoy a cup 
of tea. I am aware that railroads do 
not traverse the best streets and that 
locomotives are not accessories to beauty 
and comfort;' but when all extenuating 
conditions are known, it may still be 
truly asserted that there is no excuse 
for such panoramas of ugliness as our 
towns present. 

Conditions must decide the matter 
of walls and fences. They may be 
unnecessary, an impertinence and dis- 
figurement. In cities, however, — even 
small cities — it sometimes happens that 
one cannot step* out the front door 
without being on dress parade; and if 
the back yard is just an extension of 
other back yards and has no barriers 
or screens, there is no relief from 
constant publicity. This, I contend, is 
harmful to body and mind and soul. 

City houses are ingenious in their 
conveniences. They are so convenient 
that life in them is just about reduced 
to nothing — all the stalwart human 
faculties contracted — as the stomach 
would be, if all its food were predigested. 
There will always be people who will 
do without necessities, if they can have 
luxuries, but there arc others who will 
broaden their lives, if they can see 
the way to do it. Some of them forego 
conveniences, rent a little house way 
off at the end of the car-line and then 
move — where they can breathe and 
hoe cabbages. And Madame does not 
need the foulard silk, which her indul- 
gent and admiring husband sees in 
the store windows and offers to bring 
out to her; but she tells the good man 
as sweetly as she can, that he may 
send her, instead, two big wagon loads 
of good dirt which shall cover the 
clay the builders left around the house. 
Then she is ready to begin. Success 
to you, my dear woman, and to your 
husband, who joyfully helps in the 
digging.

Yet the wood-thrush bathes in its sparkling

And tunes his sweet minstrelsy. 

Only a little wind flower, 

Yet a wayfarer distressed, 
Is soothed by the sight of its lovliness 

And pifices it on his breast.

A kindly deed — a face to hold

THE NEW TITLE 

THE facsimile of oxir new and 
enlarged title, AMERICAN 
COOKERY, formerly The Boston 
Cooking-School Magazine, which was 
promised for this page, fails to be 
completed in time for press. In con- 
nection with this change, however, 
the main thing to hold in considera- 
tion is, that our aim is growth and 
expansion. As a clean, special, high- 
class publication we claim recognition. 
Our subscribers, in large nimibers, 
renew their subscriptions year after 
year; often former subscribers return 
to this special, culinary periodical, 
to secure the simple, unalloyed class 
of work we do. Forward, upward, 
to render better, higher service is 
the single motive that actuates the 
entire management of this publication. 

MODERN HOUSEKEEPING 

OUR day is that of short-cuts, 
labor-saving devices and greater 
efficiency in all forms of labor. In 
steam and electricity man has come 
into possession of forces of wellnigh 
unlimited possibilities. Without these 
forces many a modern undertaking, 
such as the construction of a subway, 
a tunnel, a canal or a steamship, had 
been impossible and futile. In recent 
years the forces of nature, formerly 
known, have been multiplied myriads 
of times and the benefits to mankind 
that accrue therefrom surpass even 
the expectation of dreams. 

The processes of simplification, 
elimination and labor-saving have not 
been excluded from the household. 
In this line much has been done, though 
much more remains still to be done. 
Many seem to think the time has 
come to eliminate most of the work 
of housekeeping, to have a system 
working so well that half an hour a 
day is all the time needed to keep a 
household running smoothly, in order 
to gain time for other and more im- 



EDITORIALS

portant matters. The argument is 
tinanswerable, but the thing itself, 
i. e. the reduction of household labor 
to periods of minutes, simply can 
not be done. Simplify at will, use 
all modem appliances and accessories, 
and we still must face the fact, that 
to keep a house in hygienic condition 
and prepare three meals a day requires 
a good deal of time and labor on the 
part of somebody. 

After all, do we wish to get rid of 
work or to make our tasks a means of 
pleasure and happiness? Besides, as 
some one has said, are there to be no 
duties left in life to perform? The 
most nervous and tired-looking women 
of the day, we suspect, are those who 
are active members of several clubs 
and, at the same time, are trying to 
simplify the ways of housekeeping. 

To supervise a household is one 
thing, to do the everyday work therein 
is quite another thing. In order to 
become efficient housekeepers, what 
we need is not so much the avoidance 
of house work as a growing interest 
and pleasure in a better and more 
satisfactory performance of our daily 
duties. In hard work, cheerfully done, 
is the healthiest way of living. 

THE BALANCED MEAL 

WE hear much about balanced 
meals. People are making 
repeated inquiries about the matter, 
showing how few are they who are 
acquainted with the meaning of the 
term. The subject is rather large, 
complicated and not easily made clear. 
It involves some knowledge of the 
composition of foodstuffs and their 
respective food values. It also involves 
knowledge of physiology, especially as 
to the functions of digestion and 
assimilation of nutrients in the human 
system. Even such terms as calories, 
enzymes and metabolism can not be 
overlooked. 

Chemistry is a very interesting and 
important branch of science, yet 



comparatively few people have the 
time or the inclination to live closely 
up to the requirements of chemical 
formulas. The most of us must be 
content with the general results derived 
from the analyses and researches of 
the chemist and scientist. 

That so little has been known, or 
so little notice taken, of the balanced 
meal in the past is proof, perhaps, 
that the matter is not so serious, 
after all, as some would have us think; 
yet knowledge of every kind is never 
to be despised, and the laws of nature, 
which is truth, should ever be observed. 
The centenarian Comaro, whose fame 
is world-wide, used to weigh his food 
and ate just so many ounces a day. 
He asserts that an excess of even two 
ounces a day would cause him suffering 
and illness. He learned by self-obser- 
vation and experience what kinds of 
food and how much of each were best 
suited and most agreeable to his needs. 
His diet came to consist principally 
of bread, milk, eggs, some varieties 
of fish, fruit and vegetables, with a 
small portion of chicken or lamb, 
occasionally. By the strict obser- 
vance of temperance in both eating 
and drinking he lived in the enjoyment 
of excellent health, both physical and 
mental, one hundred and three years. 

In this matter of diet, the case of 
each individual differs from that of 
every other. Each must, in a sense, 
be a law unto himself. Natural con- 
stitution, occupation, age, time spent 
daily in work or exercise out of doors, 
etc., etc., all must be considered in 
determining a fitting and proper dietary. 
In the selection and combination of 
foods, intelligence as well as old-time 
commonsense is called for. At any 
rate, from the experience and obser- 
vation of ages the consensus of opinion 
is that temperance promotes health 
and well being. While, on the other 
hand, excess in any form tends to 
undermine and destroy the strongest 
constitution.

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



But what is the well-balanced meal? 
How are we to know it? When one 
has sufficient knowledge of foodstuffs 
and food principles, of which there 
are four classes, as well as the processes 
of human nutrition, he will know 
that a balanced ration means, in sub- 
stance, the selection and combination 
of the several classes of foods in such 
proportions as will satisfy the wants 
of the human system at any age, period 
or circumstance of life. Is it not, then, 
plain, that, to determine the well 
balanced meal, scientific knowledge as 
well as a careful study of prevailing 
conditions is required. Exactness here 
must be left to the chemist, the dieti- 
tians in hospitals, sanitariums, and 
like institutions; the average house- 
keeper or dispenser of bills of fare 
must depend on general information 
as to facts and principles that have 
been tried and proven true. Much 
has already been written on this subject. 
Books on dietetics and the science of 
nutrition are numerous. These are 
storehouses of information, from which 
the reader may gain, here a little and 
there a little, instruction until her 
comprehension of the subject will suffice 
for all practical purposes. Our business 
as housekeepers is largely in the prac- 
tical application of the household arts as 
far as these have been developed and 
made known. 

SEATS AND SITTERS 

"/^NE of my hardest tasks,'* said 
^^ a successful portrait painter, "is 
to get my women patrons to sit properly. , 
A woman, even one who walks grace- 
fully, tends to crumple up the moment 
she sits down.*' 

This artist insists that to sit grace- 
fully one must choose a seat where 
grace is possible. Rocking-chairs he 
places in the category with dressing 
gowns and old slippers. They may 
be comfortable with one's feet on a 



stool, but forty-nine out of fifty, he 
says, are too large, too high, or tilt 
back too far for the ordinary woman 
to use. In his own apartments there 
is not a rocking-chair to be seen. The 
type of chair that he favors is one 
with a straight back, and a seat that 
is rather narrow from back to front. 

The artist says that a girl who 
aspires to sit gracefully should choose 
a chair of -such size and shape that 
she can sit well back in it without 
causing her heels to leave the floor, 
and should then hold her chest high, 
and lean forward very slightly — just 
enough to throw the weight of the 
trunk in front of the base of the spine. 
He mentions Gainsborough's portrait 
of Mrs. Siddons, and also the same 
artist's portrait called "The Sisters," 
as showing women who knew how 
to sit gracefully. 

A girl from a school in which the 
teachers are expected to train the 
pupils to graceful poise adds a few 
rules for sitting. 

"It is easy to sit properly," she 
says, "at the dinner table, yet there 
is no place where the difference between 
the graceful and the awkward woman 
is more apparent. 

"In the dining chair, and in all 
small, straight chairs, sit as far back 
in the seat as possible; raise the chest, 
and lean forward very slightly. When 
sitting on a couch, or a chair so broad 
in the seat that sitting far back would 
raise your heels from the floor, do not 
allow an anxious hostess to stuff pillows 
behind you, but sit near the edge of 
the couch, and keep the chest raised 
and the body slightly inclined. 

"Above all, never sit on the base 
of the spine. It is not only an awkward 
position, but one that is injurious to 
health. When leaning back in a chair, 
be mindful of the position of the feet. 
Keep them comparatively near to- 
gether." — Youths Companion.

Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 

IN all recipes wheie flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after wfting 
once. Where flour ia measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful 
is meant. A tablespoonful or teaspoonful of any designated material is a LEVEL spoonful. 



Crabflake Cocktail 

FOR each service, mix one table- 
spoonful and a half of tomato 
catsup, half a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice, three or four drops of tabasco 
sauce, a few grains of salt and half 
a teaspoonful of mushroom catsup; 
turn into a tiny ramekin (two inches 
across the top), set the ramekin on a 
small plate, and beside the ramekin 
set a choice lettuce leaf filled with bits 
of crabflake. In sections where fresh 
crabs are not obtainable, one may often 
be able to get the crabmeat by the 
pound, at a hotel. Hotels purchase 
crabflakes in five pound packages, but 
fish dealers in small cities are not accus- 
tomed to keep such supplies. 

Consomme, Irma 

Prepare a rich consommfe with beef, 
veal and chicken and clarify in the 
usual manner. Serve half a dozen 



chicken quenelles, with three or four 
green peas in the center of each, in 
each plate of soup. 

Chicken Quenelles for Consommfe, 
Irma 
Scrape the pulp from enough raw 
chicken breast to half-fill a cup; cook 
soft white bread crumbs in chicken 
broth or milk, stirring constantly, to 
a smooth paste, and cool the paste; 
to the scraped chicken add one-fourth 
a cup of the bread paste (panada) and 
the unbeaten white of one egg, and 
pound with a pestle to a smooth paste; 
press through a sieve with the pestle, 
then beat in very thoroughly the white 
of one egg beaten dry, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and half a cup of cream, 
beaten firm. Dip two teaspoons in 
boiling water, and in them shape the 
mixture into quenelles; first fill one 
spoon, in the center of the mixture 
set four or five cooked peas, seasoned

with salt, black pepper and butter, 
then cover with the chicken mixture, 
shaping it with a second spoon. When 
all are made, cover with boiling con- 
sonim6 or water and let cook until firm 
throughout. The liquid should not boil. 
Select small teaspoons or use after- 
dinner cofEee spoons. 

Eggs in Ramekin Cups, with 
Pastry 

Select cups of suitable size. Allow 
three hard-cooked eggs for each two 
persons to be served. To cook the 
eggs, set them in an agate dish over 
the fire, cover with boiling water 
{two inches above the eggs), let stand, 
without boiling but on the range, cov- 
«red, for ten minutes, then let heat 
to the boiling point; remove from the 



a third a cup of tomato or Madeira 
sauce and serve at once. For Madeira 
sauce, use brown stock and tomato 
piu*^ (half and half) in making the 
sauce and finish with one or two table- 
spoonfuls of Madeira wine- 

Eggs a la Hussard 
To serve four persons, prepare four 
rounds of fried or toasted bread, six 
tablespoonfuls of chopped, cooked ham, 
four tablespoonfuls of chopped, cooked 
mushrooms, four careftilly poached fresh 
eggs, four slices of broiled tomato, and 
about half a cup of Hollandaise sauce. 
If preferred the bread may be spread 
with butter and then browned in the 
oven. Mix the ham and mushrooms 
and spread over the hot bread; set 
the tomato above the ham mixture,

fire after boiling one minute. Remove 
the shells and cut into even slices; 
for each three eggs, prepare a cup of 
sauce. For the sauce, use two table- 
spoonfuls, each, of butter and flour, 
one-fourth a teaspoonful, each, of salt' 
and pepper and half a cup, each, of 
thin cream and chicken or veal broth. 
Add the sliced eggs to the sauce and 
turn the mixture into the buttered cups. 
Set rounds of flaky paste above the 
mixture to rest on the rim of the rame- 
kin. Reheat in the oven. 

Eggs in Flat Low Ramekins, 
Zingara 

Spread rounds of toast with butter 
and fine-chopped cooked ham; set these 
in flat ramekins, dispose a poached 
egg above the toast, pour over about 



the egg above the tomato and pour 
the sauce over the eggs. 

Tomato Slices for Eggs Hussard 
The slices of tomato may be baked 
or broiled. To bake, set in a buttered 
dish, season with salt and pepper and 
let cook until hot throughout. Transfer 
to the prepared toast with a broad 
spatula. To broil, brush over with 
melted butter, then pat in soft, sifted 
bread crumbs and set to cook in a 
well-oiled broiler. Turn often while 
cooking,

a teaspoonful, each, of salt and paprika; 
add one-fourth a cup of boiling water 
and stir and cook over hot water until 
thickened slightly; add one tablespoon- 
ful of lemon juice. 

Lobster, Cardinal, en Ramekins 
A lobster weighing one pound and 
a half will serve six. There will be 
about a pint (generous measure) of 
solid flesh, cut in cubes, beside the 
soft portions to be added to the sauce. 
Put the body bones — freed of flesh — 
over the fire with a sprig of parsley, 
slice of onion, two or three leaves of 
sweet basil and a few trimmings of 
fresh fish, if at hand; cover with cold 
water and let simmer half an hour, 
then strain off the broth and let reduce 
without boiling. Have ready a cup 
of tomato purfe — strained, cooked to- 
mato — and let this simmer until re- 
duced nearly one-half. Beat two table- 
spoonfuls of butter to a cream, then 
beat in the coral from the lobster — 
if there be coral — first pressed through 
a sieve, and the aoft greenish parts 
of the lobster. Melt three tablespoon- 
fuls of butter; in it cook four table- 



spoonfuls of flour and a scant half 
teaspoonful, each, of salt and paprika, 
then add a cup of the reduced lobster 
broth, half a cup of tomato pur^ and 
stir until boiling; add one-fourth a 
cup of cream or mushroom liquor, 
let boil again; then add the prepared 
butter, and, lastly, fold in the cubes 
of lobster. Add the lobster with as 
few motions as possible to avoid injur- 
ing the shape of the pieces. Turn 
the mixture into buttered ramekins, 
sprinkle with grated cheese and set 
into the oven to become very hot. 
Set a fan from the tail in each rame> 
kin, if desired, 

StuflFed Chicken Legs 
This dish furnishes a particularly 
choice way of serving chicken legs, 
when the rest of the chicken is used 
in other dishes. Remove the legs from 
the chickens, without cutting the skin 
at the joint, that is, separate the leg 
at the joint, but include a short length 
of skin above the joint. Loosen the 
skin from the bone at the foot end; 
then loosen the flesh from the bone 
at the other end, and by scraping

with the back of the knife close to the 
bone, turn the flesh wrong side out 
and away from the bone down to the 
foot end, thus boning the joint. After 
one has been done, the others can be 
done in two minutes each. With a 
sharp knife scrape the flesh from the 
tendons, one after another; wipe the 
flesh and turn the flesh inside. For 
eight or ten legs have ready one pound 
of choice sausage meat and about half 
the quantity of D'Uxelles preparation. 
Mix the sausage and D'Uxelles and 
use to stuff the legs, giving them the 
shape of small hams; turn the skin 
over the top and sew it in place, also 
take a stitch at the lower end. Set 



set an aigrette in the small end and dis- 
pose around a pyramid of cold cereal, 
brushed with beaten white of egg and 
sprinkled with fine-chopped parsley. 
Surround with French chestnuts, shelled, 
blanched and simmered tender in veal 
broth. When done reduce the broth 
to a glaze; return the chestnuts to the 
glaze with salt, pepper and butter, and 
shake them over the fire until well 
coated with the glaze. Serve the broth 
in which the legs were cooked in a browc 
sauce. If preferred the legs may be 
cooled a little, then egged-and-crumbed 
and fried in deep fat. Macaroni or 
asparagus or string beans may replace 
the chestnuts. 

Chaudfroid of Chicken Legs 

Prepare and cook the chicken legs 
as in the preceding recipe, then let 
cool imder a weight. For six or eight 
legs, prepare a cup and a half of cream 
sauce; to this add one-fourth a package 
of gelatine softened in one-fourth a 
cup of cold water or consomm^; take 
out about one-fourth of the sauce; to, 
this add Worcestershire sauce, mush- 
room catsup and kitchen bouquet to tint 
it dark brown. Remove the skin from

straws; keep the straws as long as 
the slices will allow. Take one slice 
for each service. Roll cream cheese 
into ■ egg-shapes, the size of birds' 
eggs. Dispose the pineapple straws, 
nest-shape, in heart leaves of lettuce

Kaiser Rolls 
Soften a cake of compressed yeast in 
one-fourth a cup of boiled water, cooled 
to a lukewarm temperature, and stir in 
about three-fourths a cup of flour or 
enough to make a dough that may be 
kneaded. Knead the little ball of dough 
until it is smooth and elastic. Then 
make a deep cut across the dough in 
both directions, Have ready two cups 
of boiled water, cooled to a lukewarm 



temperature, and into this put the 
ball of dough. It will sink to the 
bottom of the dish, but will gradu- 
ally rise as it becomes light. In about 
fifteen minutes it will float upon the 
water, a light, puffy "sponge." Into 
this water and sponge stir a teaspoonful 
of salt and between six and seven cups 
of flour. Knead or pound the dough 
about twenty minutes. Let rise, in 
a temperature of about 70 degrees F., 
until the mass is doubled in bulk. 
Divide into pieces weighing about three 
ounces, each. {There should be about 
fourteen pieces.) Shape these into balls. 
Set these in buttered pans, some dis- 
tance apart. Cover and let become 
light. Pres-s a "Kaiser Semmeln" cut- 
ter down into the top of each roll 
and give it a slightly rotary motion; 
brush over the tops generously with 
melted butter, and set to bake at otue 
in a hot oven. Bake twenty or twenty- 
five minutes. When nearly baked, brush 
over with the beaten white of an egg, 
and return to the oven to finish baking. 
Bake the biscuit as soon as they are 
cut and brushed with butter. Only by 
this means can the shape and fine 
texture of this form of bread be secured. 

Blitzen (Lightning) Cake 
Beat half a cup of butter to a cream; 
gradually beat in half ^ cup of sugar, 
the yolks of four eggs, beaten light, three 
tablespoonfuls of milk, and, lastly, one 
cup- of sifted flour, sifted again with 
one teaspoonful of baking powder. 



MRS. HILLS BABY BALTIMORE CAKES, LITTLE EASTER SPONGE CAKES. 



SEASONABLE RECIPES

Spread the mixture in a square (shallow) 
baking pan. Beat the whites of four 
eggs dry; gradually beat into them 
three-fourths a cup of sugar, then fold 
in half a cup of almonds, blanched and 
chopped. Spread this meringue evenly 
over the cake mixture, dredge the top 
with sugar and cinnamon and let bake 
about thirty minutes. Cut in strips 
two inches by one inch for serving. 

Dessert Torte 

Beat the whites of six eggs dry; then 
gradually beat into them one cup and 
three-fourths of granulated sugar; con- 
tinue the beating until the mixture is 
dry and glossy. Spread waxed paper 
on a meat board that may be set into 
an oven. Lay a plate nine inches in 
diameter on the paper and draw a 
pencil around it; fill the space inside 
the pencil mark with meringue, making 
it smooth and level on the top. Lay 
the plate down a second time and draw 
a pencil around it, then lay a second 
plate seven inches in diameter inside 
the pencil mark and again drawn a 
line. With spoon spread meringue on 
this two-inch space, then pipe the rest 
of the meringue above. Set into a 
moderate oven to cook about thirty-five 
minutes. The meringue should not 
color until the last of the cooking. 
When cooked invert the solid meringue 
on a serving dish, and set the 
ring of meringue on the edge (the two 
soft sides together); when ready to serve 
fill the center with halves of canned, pre- 
eerved or brandied peaches: set a cone 
or round of vanilla ice-cream on each 
half-peach, and pour raspberry (Melba) 
sauce over the cream. The torte is par- 
ticularly good, at this season, filled 
with very ripe strawberries . and whip- 
ped cream. 

Mrs. Hill's Baby Baltimore Cakes 

Beat one-fourth a cup of butter to 
a cream; gradually beat in half a cup 
of granulated sugar, the beaten yolks 
of four eggs, one-fourth a cup of milk. 



the grated rind of one orange or half 
a teaspoonful of orange extract, and, 
lastly, one cup of sifted flour, less 
two tablespoonfuls, sifted again with 
two level teaspoonf uls of baking powder. 
Bake in a well-buttered lemon-queen 
pan from fifteen to twenty minutes. 
When baked the cakes should be of 
a golden color on all sides. The mix- 
ture makes fourteen cakes. Dry six 
macaroons in a warming oven, roll on 
a board and sift. Melt one cup and 
a half of sugar in half a cup of boiling 
water; wash down the sides with the 
fingers wet repeatedly in cold water, 
cover and let boil rapidly about three 
minutes, uncover and let boil, undis- 
turbed, to 240 degree P. on a sugar ther- 
mometer, or until a long thread will 
spin from the spoon. Or tmtil the sy- 
rup will form a consistent "soft ball" 
when tested in cold water. Beat the 
whites of two eggs; pour on the syrup 
slowly and in a fine stream, beating 
constantly meanwhile; tint very deli- 
cately with a little rose color-paste; 
flavor with half a teaspoonful of vanilla 
and a few drops of almond extract. 
Cut each cake in three even slices; 
mix the sifted macaroon powder with 
enough frosting to make a mixture 
that will spread. Put the layers of 
each cake together with just enough 
of the macaroon mixture to hold them 
in place. Cover the outside with the 
plain frosting. When the frosting begins 
to "set", score it on top with a knife 
and sprinkle it with pistachio nuts 
chopped fine without being blanched. 

Little Easter Sponge Cakes 

Beat the whites of three eggs dry and 
the yolks of four eggs until thick and 
light-colored. To the yolks add the 
grated rind of a lemon or an orange and 
gradually beat in half a cup of granu- 
lated sugar, then two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter; astly, fold in half a 
cup of sifted pastry flour and the whites 
of the eggs. Bake in small oval shaped

BUT half the recipe for the pine- 
apple dessert was needed on 
Tuesday. The other half of 
the can of pineapple, turned into an 
earthen bowl, co\'ered and set aside 
in the refrigerator, will supply fruit 
for this morning's breakfast. The 
remnants of the fish, cooked on Tues- 
day, and the potatoes, left over from 
dinner on Wednesday, provide the 
materials for the fish cakes. Before 
setting the fish away on Tuesday, 
the flesh was picked from the skin 
and 1 ones with a silver fork, dressing 



and sauce added and the whole was 
ready for use when needed. Now, 
on Thursday morning, cut the cold 
potatoes in halves, lengthwise; take 
a portion equal in bulk to the fish. 
If the quantity of fish be small, and 
anchovy paste (put up in jars) be 
convenient, a little of this vrA\ make 
up for the deficiency of fish, and more 
potatoes may be used. Cover the 
potatoes with boiHng water to whicli 
salt is added. Cover and let boil 
\'igorously about five minutes, let drain. 
and dry off on the stove then press 
through a rieer; add the fish mixturt-, 
butter and milk, salt and pepper as 
needed; beat thoroughly, then shape 
into flat round cakes; pat these on 
both sides in flour. Have ready a 
frying pan in which some shreds cf 
fat salt pork have been slowly cooldnp: 
when these are crisp and lightly colored, 
skim them on to a hot platter, put in 
the fish cakes and let cook until browned 
on one side, then turn to brown thf 
other side. If convenient, use butter- 
milk or sour milk for the waffles. 
Sift together one cup and a fourth ol" 
flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, and 
one level teaspoonful and a half of 
baking powder. Sift half a teaspoon- 
ful, scant measure, of soda into one 
cup of the buttermilk or sounnilk. 
and stir thoroughly, then add to the 



OUR DAILY BREAD 



701 



flotir with the yolks of two eggs; mix 
thoroughly, beat in the whites of two 
e^gs beaten dry, and two tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter. Do not add the 
whites of eggs until the waffle iron 
is hot and the family is ready for the 
waffles. Have a cloth on a fork with 
which, to grease the iron. At once 
put a spoonful of the mixture in each 
division of the iron and let cook until 
thoroughly browned. With a gas 
flame or a coal fire burning uniformly 
close under the iron, waffles may be 
cooked well and expeditiously. The 
recipe Will fill the usual size of waffle 
iron five times. These waffles may 
be eaten from the fingers without 
butter or syrup. The latter does not 
seem appropriate after fish. 

For dinner, the calf's liver, left from 
that purchased for Wednesday's break- 
fast, seems to be the article that should 
be presented. Braised liver is a much 
prized dinner dish, but for this method 
of cooking a whole liver is prefer- 
able. Then, too, if hashed, poached 
eggs may accompany it, and this 
provides a substantial article for the 
children, one of whom may not be of 
age to eat such articles as liver. The 
poached eggs may be served above 
the hashed liver or on rounds of toast 
around the liver. 

To prepare the liver, cut it into 
slices and pour over it boiling water 
to cover; let stand five or six minutes, 
then drain, wipe on a cloth and chop 
fine. Melt a tablespoonful of butter 
in a saucepan, put in the hashed liver, 
cover and let simmer very gently about 
one hour, stirring occasionally. Then 
add a' dash of paprika, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and two or three tablespoon- 
fuls of hot water or broth, and serve 
when mixed thoroughly. 

The potatoes should be set to bake 
after the liver has been cooking about 
fifteen minutes. Beet greens, even 
when young, require long cooking, 
probably about two hours; drain care- 
fully and season with salt and plenty 



of butter. After dinner chop fine 
whatever is left of the green vegetable, 
beet greens or spinach, press it com- 
pactly into a bowl, and set aside in 
the refrigerator that it may be ready 
to unmold for supper. Add a few 
drops of onion juice to the French 
dressing served with the chilled vege- 
table. For a change, use part whole 
wheat flour, in making the biscuit. 
For the pudding, blanch one cup of 
rice (bring quickly to the boiling point 
in about three pints of cold water, let 
boil two minutes, drain, rinse in cold 
water and drain again), add three 
cups of boiling water, or part milk, 
and half a teaspoonful of salt and 
let cook in a double boiler until ten- 
der. Do not stir but keep the grains 
distinct. Turn the rice into a dish, 
and return the double boiler to the 
fire with one pint of milk; sift together 
two tablcspoonfuls of cornstarch, half 
a cup of sugar and half a teaspoonful 
of salt, then stir into the hot milk; 
continue to stir until the mixture 
thickens, then cover and let cook 
ten minutes. Beat the yolks of two 
eggs, add two tablcspoonfuls of sugar 
and beat again and stir into the hot 
mixture, then carefully fold in as much 
of the rice, as is needed to make a 
pudding of good consistency. Each 
grain of rice should be separate and 
distinct in the mixture, which will 
thicken more after it is set into the 
oven. Flavor with half a teaspoonful 
of vanilla or with a grating of orange 
or lemon rind. Turn the mixture 
into a buttered pudding dish. Beat 
the whites of the two eggs dry, then 
beat in, gradually, four tablcspoonfuls 
of sugar; spread the meringue over 
the pudding. This should be ready 
when the potatoes and biscuits are 
taken from the oven; reduce the 
heat and let cook ten or twelve minutes 
without taking on any color, then in- 
crease the heat and let color very 
delicately. The rest of the rice can 
be used the next day.

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



For the soup at supper, cook half 
a can of tomatoes, two slices of onion, 
two branches of parsley, half a chili 
pepper, four slices of carrot and half 
a teaspoonful of spiced herbs, tied 
in a bit of cheese-cloth, twenty minutes. 
Strain through a sieve fine enough 
to keep back the seeds. To the pulp 
add the lamb broth or liquid from 
the shoulder of lamb cooked on Wed- 
nesday. Add salt as needed. 

If a little more consistency is desired, 
add two teaspoonfuls of potato flour 
stirred into a little cold water, let 



boil ten minutes, skim and it is ready 
to serve. While the soup is cooking, 
spread a tiny bit of butter on the 
center of Boston crackers, split in 
halves, and let brown slightly in the 
oven. Toast the biscuit, pulled apart 
with the fingers, and prepare the 
French dressing. Allow a tablespoon- 
ful of olive oil and a scant half teaspoon- 
ful of vinegar for each service. 

The meals for this day are simple 
and require only a short attendance 
in the kitchen ; yet dishes well done re- 
quire carefxil attention.

Brick and Mortar Gardens 

By Virginia Richmond 



IT is a discoiiraging prospect, is it 
not? that little patch of ground 
behind the city house, often shut 
in by other buildings, and almost as 
often simply a dumping-ground for 
debris. To the owner of such a place, 
who also lives in it, there is every 
incentive to spend money and labor 
on it, for he has the future before 
him; and a backyard, granting un- 
limited fertilizer and care, will yield 
as good results as any other bit of 
ground where the same conditions pre- 
vail. But most city houses are occu- 
pied by yearly tenants, whose hope 
of reaping what they sow is so tmcer- 
tain that any effort toward improve- 
ment seems a waste of energy. 

To the inexperienced gardener, it 
looks like too large a contract to be 
undertaken, this making the wilderness 
to blossom like a rose; yet it can be 
done in a short time and at small cost, 
if the gardener will be satisfied with 
a few simple things, and is not led away 
into experimenting with rare or diffi- 
cult plants, for the latter ask every- 
thing in the way of care and nourish- 
ment before they will yield anything 
in return. 

Subsoil and stones, such as compose 
the backyards of most city gardens, 
do not look like a promising field for 
cultivation. They cannot be expected 
to produce prize specimens, but with 
a little patience, judgment and care 
they will give abundant greenery and 
color from spring tmtil fall, and bring 
a bit of country freshness between 
the confining walls. 

Cultivation, that is the essential 
point. The grocer will, for a quarter, 
bring 4a barrel of well decomposed 
manure. Economically distributed close 
to the roots of the individual plants, 
and with plenty of wateti a little care, 
and a reaaonable amount of sunshinei 



a great deal can be done, if the soil is 
thoroughly cultivated. By cultivation 
is meant deep spading and turning 
over of the grotmd, breaking the clods, 
picking out the stones, extirpating the 
weeds, and hoeing and raking tmtil 
the texture of the earth is made fine 
and light. 

Of course, the first step toward the 
transformation of the backyard is dis- 
posing of the trash; but only brickbats, 
old metal and such need be absolutely 
removed. All that can be burned, 
especially old barrels and boxes, should 
be burned, and the ashes scattered, 
as they are a valuable fertilizer. If 
there are droppings of lime and mortar, 
not in large lumps, these, too, may 
be spread evenly over the surface before 
it is spaded. The most difficult soil 
is that which is not only poor, but has 
the quality of forming hard clods; for 
whatever nourishment it possesses is 
locked up in these lirnips, which plant 
roots cannot penetrate. Therefore sand, 
sawdust, anything which, once mixed 
with such soil, will prevent it from 
clinging together again, increases its 
fertility, even if it adds no nourish- 
ment. Where the ground is of this 
character, a liberal dressing of rather 
fine coal ashes from the cellar furnace, 
which will cost nothing, will be helpful. 

Then the ground must be well spaded, 
hoed and raked. A laborer will charge 
about a dollar and a quarter for spading 
a patch forty feet square, and it will 
probably take him little more than two 
hours, because, unless the hirer is 
beside him, he will not break the clods 
he turns over, and will skim off only 
the cream of the stones which rise 
to the surface. Spading and picking 
boulders are the only back-breaking 
processes. All the rest, including hoeing 
and raking, can be done by the gardener 
hioiflelf.

• 

This work of preparing the soil need 
not necessarily be deferred until spring. 
If the garden is begun later, there will 
be no immediate results, it is true, 
for planting-time for annuals is over; 
but in the late summer, roots of peren- 
nial plants may be set out, and they 
will have time to establish themselves 
before winter and will bloom the next 
spring or summer. Even the late fall 
is not too late to begin, for although 
nothing can be planted, if the soil is 
opened and prepared, frost will pene- 
trate and pulverize it, and throw up 
more stones, and snow, which has a 
pertain amount of fertilizing power, 
will sink into and enrich it. 

The average city-dweller is too inex- 
perienced in gardens, and too busy, 
and has too many more pressing de- 
mands upon his resources, to spend 
much time, skill or money on his back- 
yard. But it is possible to make it 
attractive at small expense, and with 
very little knowledge, and only as 
much labor as will be interesting. A 
little work tells for a great deal in a 
small space. If too much is attempted, 
neglect and consequent failure will 
result, so it is best to start with modest 
plans. A flower border two or three 
feet wide next the boundary fence 
all around, with a square of grass in 
the middle, is the usual arrangement, 
because it is the simplest and gives the 
greatest results with the least work. 
Vines should be planted close to the 
fence and trained against it on wires; 
and if the wires are run in the same 
direction as the cracks of the fence, 
they will be invisible. Then may come 
a row of the taller flowering plants, 
and on the edge a line of low-growing 
things. Do not make the mistake of 
stocking the border in the spring with 
potted plants, covered with flowers. 
The instant effect is all that could 
be wished, but after the existing crop 
of flowers has faded, the plants, which 
have been forced to exhaustion in the 



greenhouse, will perish, or stand still 
and do nothing for the rest of the 
season. If plants are bought at all, 
they should be young, thrifty ones 
which have never bloomed. A few 
geraniums and a heliotrope are a good 
selection. Roses are not desirable be- 
cause they ask for rich soil, and, if 
they do not have it, yield only a few, 
poor flowers. Moreover, their season 
of bloom is short, and as they take 
up much room and are subject to many 
diseases and insects, they are not pro- 
fitable occupants. Baby ramblers may 
possibly be excepted, as they are small 
and the space they fill may well be 
spared, in consideration of the splendid 
blotch of color they make when in 
bloom. 

Where soil is extremely poor, any- 
thing which is patient enough to grow 
in it should be gratefully adopted, 
even some of the common, wild things, 
roots of which may be obtained during 
a day's trip in the country. Virginia 
Creeper, and Trumpet Vine, which 
is wild in some districts, are desirable 
for the fence. Common Elder is a 
clean, quick-growing shrub; and as 
for the despised Pokeweed, it is so 
handsorhe a plant that, if it were rare, 
it would be a garden aristocrat. The 
Alianthus, which is really a tree, is 
well worth planting as a shrub, since 
it requires no attention, and its tropical 
leaves are free from all disease. As 
for Mint, even a broken sprig of it 
will root easily, and it spreads so quickly 
as to become a nuisance, if it is not, 
kept in check; but it is deliriously 
fragrant, and is much pleasanter to 
look at than bare ground. 

Country friends are always ready 
to contribute something from their 
gardens; only, as they do not realize 
the limitations of the city back-yard 
as regards soil and exposure, their 
contributions may not thrive. Sweet

What is a Sandwich? 

THE answer to that question would 
have been easy, in that far-off 
f)eriod of bliss, when wc were going fish- 
ing for minnows under the sawmill 
dam, and begged Katie for "aw jest a 
couple uv sam\viges". Indeed there was 
no such question capable of disaission. 
They just were, that's all. A sandwich ? 
Why, the idea! What should it be but 
a slice of pink, boiled ham with a dab 
of mustard, if you were old enough for 
condiments, entirely surrounded by 
bread and butter? 

And such bread and butter! The 
kind that grew on country pantry 
shelves after much mixing and many 
l>eatings, that was baked the loveliest 
tender brown, and smellcd, when it 
came out of the oven — A-a-a-h — U-u- 
u-u-m. It doesn't live in cities. And 
butter that dripped clover sweetness 
and all the freshness of green growing 
things, transmuted into firm golden 
pats, covered with a salty cloth in a 
stone crock on the cellar floor. 

Oh, dear! Why could not that supply 
have been saved by some sleeping- 
beauty magic until this degenerate 
day when unworthy imitations are 
worth their weight in diamonds.' The 
descendants of that bread-and-butter- 
making family of blessed memory would 
now be sailing giddily upon the top wave 
of finance, and sticking up their noses 
at' those other poor things, whose for- 
bears dealt with such trash as oil and 
railroads. 



Those were sandwiches, of a truth. 
But never in this wide world would 
they recognize their grandchildren. The 
same f amil y name they have kept , 
truly, but how changed their indentity. 
They have shrunk in size, become 
skinnier and skinnier as to the buttery 
layer, lost their crusts, which were the 
best part of their country ancestors, 
and which would make your hair curl, 
if you were to believe the tales of some- 
who were supposed to know cverj' thing. 
But their insidcs! Faith, they have 
multiplied in variety beyond all reason 
or belief. 

They are never sliced any more, be 
they "ha-aam — er t-o-o-o-ngue — cr 
ch'k'n", but chopped up, fine as fine, 
to conceal their real identity from too 
inquiring minds. And, maybe, they are 
not fleshly food at all. They may 
chance to be just greenery-yallery mixcd- 
up cheese and olives, or plain lettuce 
with leaky dabs of salad-dressing, or,may- 
be, those mashed-up pimentoes, which 
are nothing in the world but expurgated 
red peppers. They may be something 
or other masquerading as chicken salad, 
or even a fried egg. They may be 
skimpy layers of scraped raw beef with 
outsides of gluten health - bread, or 
generous slices of hot roast, with floods 
of gravy over the top. They may 
be diaphanous as tissue paper, or an 
entire-course dinner between crisp tri- ■ 
angles of goldy brown toast. 

They may cost ' five cents and they 
may cost seventy-five. They may live 
on a thick white plate, with an aquar-

ium globe upside down over their heads, 
and they may be borne reverently 
upon a silver platter, on a lace doiley, 
with an olive to right and a pickle to 
left, and a lettuce-leaf cup of extra 
mayonnaise teetering a little to the 
northeast. 

They may be what a dear old lady, 
who had never by any chance eaten one, 
called a "cold dog*', with thick yellow 
mustard down his back and a split fat 
roll for a covering, and they may be 
fried oysters dripping catsup gore. Eat 
them with forks or what was made 
before them. Anything that has a 
top and bottom, with something eat- 
able in the midst, is a sandwich. Any- 
thing, with the lid off, made in pretty 
patterns of mashed up things out of a bot- 
tle that makes you wonder whether they 
really are all right, with little sprinkles 
of egg-yolk over the top, to be eaten 
only with forks, and served at the begin- 
ing of keep-your-hat-on luncheon parties 
and outrageously expensive dinners, 
are French cousins to our old friends. 

Even the family name is strangely 
different. A canap6 is a far cry from 
that sandwich we munched from one 
hand, while we twiddled an angleworm 
from the end of a stick up and down 
under the ripples of the wash from the 
sawmill-dam. And for one more such 
luncheon, the modem sandwich and 
all its French relations might pass on- 
ward out of sight and out of mind, 
unwept, unhonored and unsimg. 

But they don't seem to grow any 
more. Not in cities, they don't.

When is Economy not Economy? 

FALSE economy has been respon- 
sible for many a failtire. 
' '^And its greatest devotees have been 
• its most absolute victims. 

"Economy" should mean only a wise 
disposal of means to secure ultimate 
results. 

On the contrary, it has come to 



represent only the niggardly self-denial 
and stinginess that thwarts every nat- 
ural desire and cripples native ability 
by the chilling atmosphere of con- 
scious poverty. 

"Economy is the road to the poor- 
house," says one — and it is. 

Can not every one of us recall some 
poor creature who pinched, made over 
and darned; who staid at home, "peeled 
the potatoes thin", "saved the nut- 
shells to kindle the fire", grew round- 
shouldered picking up pins, denied 
herself reading matter, because of cost; 
had guests only in stmmier to avoid 
expense of extra heat; gave up pleasant 
accomplishments always to "do some- 
thing useful", and finally came to a 
desolate, friendless, poverty-stricken old 
age by resaon of this very narrowing 
of her relations with her fellow beings. 

The wealthy ones of earth, if they 
have made their own, will be foimd to 
have spent liberally — but wisely. Ex- 
penditure in the right direction, and 
at the right rate, is economy. 

"You never reap from a field that has 
not first been sown," says the head of 
a great chemical company, that has 
never hesitated to spend money in 
outfitting and supporting a promising 
employee. 

"If you had only fifty dollars in the 
world, what wotdd you do with it?" 
asked a hesitating sotd of a man who had 
built himself up from nothing to suc- 
cess. 

"I would spend it at once," was the 
answer, "for a good suit of dothes, 
knowing it would help me to earn more." 

That was the reply of a man who 
felt ability within himself. 

The man who constantly acts as if 
the dollar in his pocket were the last 
one he wotdd ever have, is consdous of 
the lack of ability, unless he is the 
victim of early niggardly training. In 
either case, he needs to "brace up", 
and realize that repression and denial 
are not the virtues they were once 
''cradced up" to be, but

and growth of individtiality is the 
eternal demand. 

''Economy consists of going without 
something you now want, for the sake 
of sometime, in the future, having 
something you very likely may not, 
then, want,'* defines some one. It is 
a sneer, — but think it over. 

Real economy implies seeing things 
in true perspective, — not seeing small 
details near at hand so large that they 
look greater than important matters. 
You've heard about the copper cent, 
held dose to the eye, that hid from 
sight the whole farm. The brass button 
on the soldier's coat is not greater than 
the soldier. 

It is as false economy to cripple the 
present for the future that may never 
come, as it is to discount the future for 
the present. 

What is real economy under some 
circumstances, is not so under others. 
Louise, a stenographer, after a wearing 
day at the office, sits up late, sometimes, 
daintily darning fine black hose. Her 
maiden aunt after whom she is named 
has impressed it upon her that she 
should be ''economical." 

Louise, the maiden aimt, has no 
driving duties, lives on an assured 
income, — ^ the interest on inherited 
money, has no way of earning more 
money than the darning saves, and so, 
in her case, it may possibly be a merit 
to keep her clothes in perfect condition 
by hours of careful darning and mending. 
But with Louise, the stenographer, it 
is diflEerent. 

Her work-filled day leaves her jaded 
and in need of outside "good time," 
rather than eye and nerve trying darn- 
ing in the evening. 

Better save the nerves than the 
stockings. 

An evening of ** jolly good time" 
in the open air, with good company, 
would send her back to the office, not 
jaded as she often goes at present, 
but bright of eye and alert of brain. 
And the consequence might very well 



be an increased usefulness that would 
lead to increased salary, enabling her 
to wear new instead of darned hose. 

Economy is not an end in itself, but 
a means to be studied out to the perfect 
accomplishment of a desirable end.

The Studio Tea Room 
26 West 40th, Street, 

New York City. 
To the Editor 
Boston Cooking School Magazine, 

WHEN asked, to-day, how I thought 
of so many dainty dishes to serve 
in my Tea Room, I answered, "I get 
them from 'The Boston Cooking School 
Magazine' ". The magazine has been 
of untold help to me and I would like 
to pass on the knowledge of it to others. 

I began my work with no capital, 
no knowledge of cooking and very 
little idea of business methods; now I 
have one of the most successful small 
tea rooms in New York City. 

I started with a handsomely furnished 
studio and two people who wished food, 
now I have about one hundred people 
per day — on an average, for luncheon, 
dinner and tea. You can not imagine 
what a comfort the "50 Cent Luncheons" 
for 20 business men, given in the 
January number of your magazine, were 
to me. Those menus gave me a new 
lease of life. 

This year at Christmas time I made 
a specialty of English Goodie baskets, 
attractively put up and suitable for 
a gift. Each basket contained: 

6 Individual Pliun Puddings 

6 Individual Fruit Cakes 

6 Individual Mince Pies 

The cost of this basket was four dol- 
lars and fifty cents. Orders are taken 
for pies, cakes and sandwiches, t. c. l.

A Vanity Luncheon 

MAY was the daintiest of spring- 
time brides, but as the wedding 
day drew near, and we, her five faithful 
bridesmaids, had not yet seen the trous- 
seau, we were athrill with ciuiosity. 
Her taste was so exquisite and her needle 
work so fine that we could hardly 
wait. Finally, a few weeks before the 
wedding, the aforementioned five were 
bidden to a luncheon given by May's 
married sister. Upon the invitation 
cards a miniature colored fashion-figure 
had been pasted. Beside it the follow- 
ing verse was artistically printed in 
gold: — 

*'Come to the Dwelling of Vanity Fair, — 
Fashions from Paris we'll show you! 
Beauty and Springtime and Youth wiU be there,— 
Here's that the Trio may know you! 
One O'clock Luncheon. 
691 Drayton Boulevard. 
April Twenty-first." 

Upon arriving in a body, we were 
shown to an upstairs room where May 
and her sister, in black gowns, French 
cbiffures and complexions, and the most 
elegant of French accents and gestures, 
were displaying hats. The room was 
lighted by candles and filled with 



mirrors. Fashion-plates and bright- 
colored fashion pages were hung all 
about, while the hats, huge crepe- 
paper affairs, were arrayed on standards. 
Great bunches of paper flowers gave 
the room a festive air. 

One by one, the guests were seated 
at a mirror, and with many comments 
and compliments, each was fitted out 
with a marvelous hat, in her own par- 
ticular color. To each hat was pinned 
a verse, such as the following: — 

"You merry little tomboy with the lively dash- 
ing manner. 

May you keep me neat and charming all the 
year.— 
* Do not use me for a tennts-ball» or equal suffrage 
banner, 

But remember, I'm a hat, a hat, my dear." 

Another was: — 

"I am the hat for a maiden demure. 

Gentle, coquettish and shy; 
Meekly I'll charm you and gravely allure. 

Nlodest yet fetching am I." 

Still another was : — 

"I'm a naughty little hat. 
Do not ask me what I'm "at"; 
When those eyes are 'neath my brim. 
No use trying to be prim, 
No use saying I'm sedate. 
Only trust I'll stay on straight." 

When the hats were duly "sold", 
we wore them down to the dining-room 
to a delicious spring-like luncheon. 
White hyacinths held the center of 
the round table, and there was a nose- 
gay of violets at each plate. The candles 
were yellow, while violet satin ribbons 
were caught from the chandelier above 
to each of the seven places. The 
color -scheme so far as possible was 
violet, white and gold. The favors 
were tiny gold vanity boxes. 

After the luncheon was over, we were 
ushered, with accompanjdng music and 
ceremony, to a pretty upstairs room, 
where the lovely trousseau was dis- 
played to our delighted eyes. 

A foolish "Vanity Party" worthy of 
the name? Perhaps, but I do not 
think so. We were all intimate friends 
happy "together in the love of "Beauty 
and Springtime and Youth." H.c.Le b.

**Carrot Conserve." "Cucumber Relish." 



709 



THE last thing on earth which was 
guessed at a Culinary Guessing 
Contest, was the above concoction, the 
recipe for which is given below: 

Dice carrots until very small and cook 
very tender, cooking the water out of 
them. When cooked allow one quart 
of carrots, one and one-half coffee cups 
of sugar, and the grated rind and juice 
of a good sized lemon. Cook again 
until thick. This can be made any 
time through the winter when other 
jam supplies run low. - It has a very 
rich flavor on the order of quince or 
melons or orange mamjalades. 

''Horseradish and Beet Relish." 

One of the most appetizing relishes 
ever eaten is that made of pickled beets 
and grated horse-radish. This relish 
keeps fresh all winter. 

Allow one cup of horse-radish to a 
quart of chopped beets, after they are 
pickled. 

One woman has disposed of a large 
quantity of this to her friends and 
acquaintances. While fresh horse-rad- 
ish is more desirable in making this, 
the bottled answers very well. 



Large partly ripe cucumbers are 
liked best for this purpose. 

Cut the cucumbers in halves, length- 
wise, remove seeds and soft portion, 
then grate and measure; allow one- 
half as much vinegar as there is pulp. 
To each quart of pulp allow two even 
teaspoons of salt, four teaspoons of 
grated horse-radish, and one fourth a 
teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Mix well 
and bottle. If corks are used, seal 
with wax. Use cider vinegar, c. m. a.

"Mighty Good Dog Biscuit." 

FOR a hot breakfast dish or a cold 
picnic lunch, try this, a favorite 
among the Mexicans, with the allur- 
ing name of "dog biscuit". 

Common biscuit dough is rolled very 
thin and cut as usual; then a thin 
slice of bologna sausage is laid between 
two of these, the edges pressed lightly 
together, and they are baked in a quick 
oven just like ordinary biscuit. People 
who will not cat bologna usually are 
exceedingly fond of these, for the meat 
is thoroughly cooked and its flavor 
permeates the dough. l. m. c. 



Eve Exonerated 



Grandma Eve was planning dinner 

In a worried sort of way, 
Adam really was much thinner 

And that noon she'd heard him say: 

'I am tired of prunes and peanut?, 

I just hate to see a date, 
And the garden truck this garden cuts 

Is enough to nauseate!*' 

So she planned a toothsome entree. 
Donned her fig-leaf overskirt» 

Started out to search the country 
For some new kind of dessert. 

Something pungent, apt to tickle 
Adam's tummy as he'd gnaw. 

Tempting to his palate fickle — 
Pity our first mother-in-law! 



She was doing tragic thinking, 

When that famous snake, the brute. 

Came a-creeping-crawling-slinking- - 
Slyly said, "Just try this fruit!" 

So for grandpa's sake she tried it, 

Everybody knows the rest. 
Generations have implied that , 

Otherwise, we'd all be blest. 

You can grasp the moral easily, 

The problem need not baffle. 
Desserts should always simple be — 

Just hand him out an apple. 

Or in Latin — "Quae fuerant vitia mores sunt!" 
Though the thing was once quite wicked, it is 
now a stylish stunt!

Proper Food to Serve with Meats 

Meat is digested in the stomach, 
the digestive fluids of which are acid. 
We suppose this is the reason why the 
question of the propriety of eating 
bread or other starchy food with 
meat arises. Theoretically, green salad 
plants and vegetables deficient in starch 
are indicated as the proper accom- 
paniments of meat and fish. At the 
same time, we must remember that 
bread and other starchy food, rice, 
macaroni, etc.. are largely digested by 
the ptyalin of the saliva in the mouth; 
the digestion begun in the mouth is 
continued only a short time in the 
stomach, being arrested when the mass 
becom s impregnated with the add 
se::retions of the stomach. But in 
a state of health, the digestion of the 
starch will be completed by the pan- 
creas and the intestine. In disease, 
if there is overacidity of the stomach, 
it might be well to limit the food 
taken at one time to such articles as 
calls for acid to digest it. Then, when 
starchy food is eaten, take it alone; 
as the presence or sight of food calls 
out a flow of the juices that digest it, 
the flow of acid fluids would be depressed 
snd the saliva in the mouth and pep- 
sin in the stomach would keep the 
starch in good condition for the final 



digestion^in the pancreas and intestine. 
Also, as bulk of food makes for ease in 
digestion, in a normal condition of 
health, we should think it best to take 
some starchy food at a meal in which 
fish or meat was eaten.

J pound French fruit 
Maraschino 

2 ounces gelatine 

1 cup cold water 



1 pound French chest- 
nuts 
1 cup sugar 
i cup water 
1 quart milk 
The yolks of eight eggs 
i cup sugar 

Castellane Pudding 

Shell, blanch and .cook the chestnuts, 
then pound in a mortar, with the sugar 
and water, cooked together five minutes, 
and pass through a sieve. Make a 
boiled custard with the milk, yolks of 
eggs, and the half cup of sugar; add the 
gelatine, softened in the cold water, and 
strain into the chestnut mixture. Set 
into a pan of ice water and beat with a 
whisk until the mixture begins to set. 
Let the fruit, half a cup of chest- 
nuts, pineapple, cherries, etc., all cut in 
small pieces, stand some time covered 
with maraschino. When the mixture 
begins to set, drain the fruit and put into 
a mold, alternately, with the chestnut 
preparation. Let stand until very cold 
and set. Serve with whole chestnuts, 
cooked in syrup and flavored with 
vanilla. This amount will serve eigh- 
teen people. 

Mont Blanc 

Press one pint of cooked chestnuts 
through a sieve; add one-third a cup of 
sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt and a 
teaspoonful of vanilla, mix thoroughly 
and shape in a dome on a serving dish. 
Beat one cup and a half of cream, one- 
third a cup of sugar and half a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and spread or pipe 
it over the chestnut pur6e. 



Query 2154. — "Recipe for Raised (yeast) 
Doughnuts." 

Yeast Doughnuts 

About seven o'clock in the morning, 
crumble one or two yeast cakes into a 
cup of scalded-and-cooled milk; .mix 
thoroughly, then beat in about one cup 
and a fourth of bread flour. Beat 
until smooth, cover and set aside until 
well-puffed up and full of bubbles 
(about one hour). Add two eggs, half 
a cup of sugar, one third a cup of melted 
butter, half a teaspoonful, each, of 
salt and ground mace, and flotir enough 
for a soft dough. Nearly four cups of 
flour (in sponge and dough) will be 
needed. Knead the dough until smooth 
and elastic, cover and let stand until 
doubled in bulk. The time of rising 
will vary, but probably by eleven o'clock, 
at the latest, the dough will be ready 
to turn upon a floured board. Pat the 
dough into a sheet about three-fourths 
an inch thick. Cut in strips three- 
fourths an inch wide, twist and lengthen 
these, then shape like the figure eight. 
Let stand on the board, closely covered, 
until light throughout. Fry in deep 
fat, dredge with confectioner's sugar.

Query 2155. — "In a dessert containing 
milk, gelatine, cornstarch, eggs, etc, what is the 
correct order of adding the thickening ingred- 
ients to the milk?" 

Order of Adding Ingredients 

We do not, as a rule, cook gelatine ; 
eggs are cooked delicately and starch 
is cooked thoroughly. This then gives 
the order in which they should be 
added to the milk. Scald the milk, 
add the starch and let cook fifteen 
minutes; add the eggs and stir until 
*'set"; remove from the fire and add 
the gelatine, previously softened in cold 
water.

across the top, are used to hold sauce 
for oyster, lobster and other cocktails. 
See illustration in "Seasonable Recipes" 
in this issue. Ramekins of this same 
size, holding sauce tart are, are set on 
a plate on which fried fillets of fish, 
fried oysters, lobster chops or other 
similar dish is passed. Such use is 
permissible, when the article and the 
ramekin of sauce are passed on the same 
plate. Creamed fish, oysters, lobster, 
crabflakes, chicken, sweetbreads, etc., 
may be served in ramekins. When 
covered with buttered crumbs, either 
with or without grated cheese, the dish 
becomes en ramekin au gratin. If 
the sauce be highly seasoned with tab- 
asco, paT)rika, cayenne or chili peppers, 
it is called Deviled Lobster, crabflake 
etc. Tomato or Bechamel sauce may 
replace the cream sauce, when the name 
of the dish is changed accordingly. 

Sliced Eggs in Ramekins 

Hard-cooked eggs, cut in slices or 
cubes, may be served in ramekins, 
mixed with any of the above mentioned 
sauces. Mushrooms fresh or canned, 
may be used with eggs or any article, 
in any variety of sauce. 

Eggs Cooked in Ramekins 

A tablespoonful of sauce or cream 
may be turned into a buttered ramekin; 
above this break an egg, season with 
salt and pepper, pour on another table- 
spoonful of sauce or cream (prefer- 
ably hot) and let cook in hot water 
in the oven until the egg is *'set*'. 

Eggs with D'Uxelles in Ramekins 

Cook as above substituting d*uxelles 
preparation (See Seasonable Recipes) 
for the cream or sauce. Fine-chopped 
ham or chicken and soft, sifted bread 
crumbs, mixed with cream, may replace 
the d'uxelles. 



Query 2157. — "If baked potatoes are removed 
from the oven as soon as they are soft, is any 
considerable quantity of the starch dextrinized?" 



Dextrine in Baked Potatoes 

We haVe not seen tabulated resalt.> 
of experiments in determining the ooir- 
position of baked potatoes, but think 
it doubtful if there be any appreciable 
quantity of dextrine present in a 
baked potato. Probably, if any of 
the starch be dextrinized, it is that 
contained in the skin or so close to it 
that it is rarely eaten. Dextrine is 
present in the crust of a well-baked 
loaf of bread. _

on but one side. 

Welsh Rabbit (with Cream and 
Egg-Yolks) 

Prepare as above, using the yolks of 
two eggs, beaten and mixed with half 
a cup of cream, in place of the ale. A 
Welsh rabbit, at the present time, if 
not when the dish was first named.

Query 2159. — "How long does it take to 
cook mushrooms."? 

Time of Cooking Mushrooms 

Fresh mushrooms will cook in from 
ten to fifteen minutes. 



Query 2160. — "Recipe for English Muffins." 

English Muffins 

Soften a yeast cake in half a cup of 
lukewarm water. Add this to a cup of 
scalded-and-cooled milk, into which two 
tablespoonfuls of butter have been 
melted. Add also half a teaspoonful of 
salt and one cup and a half of sifted 
bread flotir. Beat the above mixttire un- 
til it is very smooth. Then cover, and 
set to rise. When the sponge is light, 
beat into it about two cups, or two and 
one-fourth cups, of flour, continuing the 
beating some few minutes (eight or ten), 
to make a tough batter. Cover, and let 
stand until again light. The mixture is 
now ready to use, or it may be cut down, 
covered, and set into the refrigerator 
until morning. When ready to bake, 
cut the dough into twenty-foiu* pieces. 
Knead these with flotired hands or on a 
well-floured board (the dough is rather 
soft). Then pat them to the size of the 
rings. Have the board well-floured, 
and the muflSn rings well-buttered. Put 
the rings on the board and the dough 
in the rings, and cover close with a 
pan or cloth. When the dough a 
little more than half fills the rings, 
remove the rings and dough with a 
spatula to a well-heated and buttered 
griddle. Keep the griddle of uniform 
heat, and, when the muffins are baked 
on one side, tiun muffins and rings, and 
bake the other side. When the muffins 
are baked, cut through the crust, then 
tear apart with the fingers (as a cracker 
is split), and toast the halves over a 
bed of coals. Spread the rough side 



with butter as soon as toasted, and serve 
at once. The muffin rings used for 
this recipe were two and three-fourths 
inches in diameter. Rings of a larger 
size may be used. Toasted muffins 
are served with marmalade and tea 
as a light lunch, or with a green veg- 
etable salad and cheese as a salad 
course. 



Query 2161. — "Which is the most approved 
article or utensil for serving water at the table. 
the pitcher or the caraf^?" 

Utensil for Water 

Whether a caraf6 or a pitcher be 
used in suppl3ring water at the table 
is a matter of individual taste. The 
pitcher is certainly the easiest to keep 
in good condition. A caraf6 may be 
kept clean and free from discolorations 
on the inside by shaking in it rice 
or potato parings and water, and then 
by washing and rinsing. 



Query 2162.— ''What is the proper width 
for hems of plain tablecloths and napkins?" 

Width of Hem for Tablecloth, etc. 

A little less than one-fourth an inch 
is the approved width of hems for 
common table linen. 



Query 2163. — "Please give a list of diff- 
erent hot breads with the distinguishing features 
of each." 

Names and Distinguishing 
Featiires of Hot Breads, etc. 

To name and feature correctly the 
various kinds of hot breads requires 
much research and discussion and it 
can not be attempted with any degree 
of thoroughness or finality. We will 
refer to a few of the more generally 
known varieties. The terms Gems and 
Muffins seem to be used indiscrimin- 
ately for drop batter preparations baked 
in utensils divided into spaces for indi- 
vidual portions. 

Griddlecakes or stone cakes were 
formerly elementary preparations of 
flour and liquid baked on a circular

present time eggs and butter are often 
added, but shortening is not added to 
make a crisp, rich cake. 

Pancakes are made of flbtir, eggs, 
milk cream or butter and admit of the 
introductions of grated potatoes, either 
raw or cooked, cooked rice etc. Pan- 
cakes, like griddle cakes, should be 
eaten at once, from the pan or griddle. 

Waffles are artistically shaped pan- 
cakes ; the name is related to the German 
name meaning honeycomb. On account 
of their crispness, they are not as 
easily spoiled as the ordinary pancake. 
Waffles are baked on specially construc- 
ted irons which allow a large heated 
surface to come in contact with the 
dough, thus producing a quickly and 
evenly baked, light-brown product. 

Flapjacks, slapjacks, batter cakes and 
hotcakes are probably local names for 
griddle cakes. 

Scones are a dough similar to Amer- 
ican biscuit dough, cut in shapes and 
baked on a griddle, first on one side 
and then on the other. Eggs are 
often used in the dough and the shapes 
are baked in the oven.

Query 2164.— "What is the difference be- 
tween doughnuts and crullers? Is it correct 
to use the term biscuit in connection with 
thin batters, raised with yeast and poured 
into muffin pans to rise?" 

Doughnuts and Crullers 

Some authorities call fried mixtures 
in which yeast is used, doughnuts, 
and fried mixtures, lightened with soda 
and cream-of-tartar or the equivalent, 
crullers. Others call a * fried mixture, 
circular in shape with a hole in the center 
a doughnut and a fried mixture that 
was cut into strips and twisted before 
frying, a cruller.

We should call a yeast batter baked

yeast biscuit. 



tins. When baked and cold invert, 
spread a little white boiled frosting 
over the top and at the center coil 
a little rose tinted frosting, sprinkle the 
whole with chopped pistachio nuts. 
The recipe makes about twenty little 
cakes. Three-fourths a cup of sugar 
and one white of egg will give an ample 
quantity of frosting. Take out two 
tablespoonfuls of the frosting to tmt 
for the center. Do not use the frosting 
until it is cold and will hold its shape. 
Then the pink frosting may be handled 
to leave a dot of white at the center 
and it will also stand up a little and 
show lines or shadings of white here 
and there. 

Rice Croquettes, Easter Style 

Blanch three-fourths a cup of rice; 
add three cups of milk and half a tea- 
spoonful of salt and let cook in a double 
boiler imtil the grains of rice are tender 
and the milk is absorbed. Add one- 
fourth a cup, each, of sugar and butter 
and the beaten yolks of three eggs; 
mix carefully, cover and let stand about 
five minutes to cook the eggs, then 
turn on to a buttered plate. When 
partly cooled, from into egg -shapes

Creamy Sauce 

Boil one cup of sugar and half a cup 
of water, as in making boiled frosting, 
then pour in a fine stream on the white 
of one egg, beating constantly mean- 
while. Beat occasionally until cold,

The Home Nurse, By Dr. E. B. 
LowRY. Cloth, Price $1.00, Chicago: 
Forbes & Co. 

Dr. E. B. Lowry, the popular writer 
on health topics, has brought out an- 
other very useful book, entitled, "The 
Home Ntu^e". It gives helpful dir- 
ections for the care of the sick in the 
home and tells how to co-operate with 
the physician in providing for the com- 
fort and cure of invalids. Full di- 
rections for first aid to the injtired are 
also given. Technical terms are avoided 
and a complete index makes it possible 
to refer quickly to the desired informa- 
tion. 

The writer is an authority on nursing 
and lectures on the subject in one of the 
leading medical colleges. The instruc- 
tions may therefore be depended upon 
as conforming with the best medical 
knowledge and practice. Physicians 
will welcome the circulation of this 
excellent book; for it will facilitate their 
efforts, it is a veritable doctor's assistant. 

It is to help the home nurse that the 
book has been prepared. It explains 
to the untrained ntu*se how to aid the 
physician by carrjdng out his directions 
intelligently A book of this character 
is very useful in the home for directions 
and guidance in times of need. 

Foods and Household Management, By 

Helen Kinne and Anna M. Coolby* 

Cloth, Price $1.10. New York: 

The MacMillan Company. 

The voltune treats specifically of 

foods, their production, sanitation, cost, 

nutritive value, preparation and serving. 

These topics being closely interwoven 

with the practical aspect of household 

management and they are followed by 



a study of the household budget and 
accounts, methods of buying, house- 
cleaning, and latmdering. It includes 
about one hundred and sixty carefully 
selected and tested recipes, together 
with a larger niunber of cooking exercises 
of more experimental nature designed 
to develop in initiative and resourceful- 
ness. It is intended for use in the 
course in household arts in high and 
normal schools, whether the work be 
vocational or general in its aim." 

Thus it will appear this volume 
is quite the most extensive, elaborate, 
and scientific text -book of household 
arts yet published. With this text- 
book and a skillful teacher for guidance, 
classes in domestic science may be 
led on safe and sure grotmd to the 
latest and best attainments in the

representative, meritorious and easily ad- 
optable methods of food preparation 
that are known, and practiced all over 
the Orient by various nationahties. * 
His theory of cooking is not uninter- 
esting. 

All human beings are naturally gifted 
■with more or less ability, when occasion 
requires, to prepare food for themselves. 
The true art of Cookery, however, is 
not the possession of many, especially 
when it is exercised for the highest good 
and pleasure of others. This truly 
specialized and praiseworthy function 
demands good judgment, an inherent 
sense of fitness and proportion in the 
choice and blending of food ingredients, 
reliable guidance, and after that practice 
and ever more practice. 

But cookery should not be made 
a difficult task by minute descriptions 
of compositions and combinations — as 
is true of many cook books — in such 
a way as to cause the average house- ,

keeper bewilderment or discour^ement. 
Of course, excellent results in the art 
of cookery require a general knowledge 
of and experience in the art, on the 
part of the cook, yet, it should also 
be left with her to make a fair attempt 
at it, and use her own judgment, con- 
siderably, regarding preparation and 
results. Cookery is neither practical or 
successful when it is too scientific, 
because such success is largely depend- 
ent on the taste of the cook and those 
for whose enjoyment it is prepared, 

CiviliEation has taught human beings 
to be careful in their selection of food- 
stuffs, and again, it has taught them, 
on the whole, to prepare the food in a 
way to make it more nourishir^ and 
palatable. Thus, the common reasons 
for cooking are already known to every 
person, which are, namely: 

To do away with the hurtful sub- 
stances in foodstuffs, and to cause 
destruction to microbes and other for- 
eign matter in flesh and in vegetables. 

To assist mastication and hasten 
digestion of food through proper com- 
binations of variouseatables ;and, finally, 

To use or serve them in the best 
style, suited to the customs and con- 
ceptions of civilized people. 

Oriental Cookery, like all else Oriental, 
is not based on strict science, but on 
natural and happy combinations of 
food ingredients and flavors which many, 
many years' experience on the part 
of different peoples has taught them. It 
is naturally harmoniously and easily 
done, and is dependent for its successful 
result on good, and wholesome ideas 
in general cooking, and anyone with a 
little courage can do it, too, without 
minutely following the given guide in 
recipes. 

Oriental cookery is valued not only 
because of its economy, because one 
can get the most out of the least mat- 
erial used in the preparations of a food, 
but it is also recognized and esteemed 
for its general body-building and nour- 
ishing character, and although it is 
solid and substantial, it is often dainty

for the house, and be benefited by the 
cutting. 

With annuals, which are raised from 
seed, as with perenials, it is wise to- 
choose a few old-fashioned, hardy var- 
ieties which grow readily and flower 
profusely. Backyard conditions are not 
favorable to rare or exotic plants. 
Only every-day things will give results 
which make such gardening worth while. 

Seeds of annuals may be planted 
in the open ground as early in the spring 
as the weather is settled and the earth 
warmed by the sun. They must not 
be sown when the ground is saturated 
with moisture, or they will rot instead 
of germinating; and if they are sown 
in a dry time, the earth must be kept 
reasonably damp by watering, so that 
the tender rootlets of the new plants 
will not perish of drought. Proper 
-directions for sowing are printed on 
the seed packets, but they do not 
insist as strongly as they should on 
the need for regular watering, both 
before and after germination. Of course, 
seedlings must not be continually flooded 
— the state of the soil must be the guide; 
and nothing must be watered when 
the sun is shining on it, as sunshine 
bakes wet foil into a crust, and the 
earth about plants should always be 
broken and friable. 

Choose a sunny, protected comer 
for the seeds, and, if the ground has 
been dug the previous fall, it should 
be spaded and raked again before either 
seeds or plants are placed in it. This 
second digging is a trifle compared 
with the first breaking of ground whidi 
has never been cultivated. The more 
earth is stirred and pulverized, how- 
ever, the more productive it will be, 
and the better wiH be the results ob- 
tained. The seeds may be sown in 
rows, each row being marked by a 
stick bearing a number. Then a memo- 
randum should be kept of the different 
varieties planted, with the number of 
the row placed opposite the name 
of the variety. In this was a beginner 
who cannot recognize difierent seed- 
lings at sight, will be able to identify

them when they appear. Of course 
they will come up too close t4^ether, 
but they should not be thinned at once, 
as many will die of their own accord. 
Of what remain, the least vigorous 
specimens in a crowd should be talcen 
out to leave room for the stronger 
ones to develop. 

After the seedlings have two or three 
pairs of leaves, they should be taken 
up and separated carefully, disturbing 
and exposing the roots as little as 
possible, and planted in the border 
where they are intended to remain. 
As the aim is not to raise speciment 
plants, but to secure a mass of color, 
seven or eight of the same kind should 
be planted near together in a row or 
group, and care should be taken that 
groups of varieties blooming at differ- 
ent times should be alternated, so that 
no part of the border will at any time 
be empty of flowers. 

Of all annuals, the Nasturtitim is 
the most cheerful and constant bloomer, 
beginning in June and continuing until 
killed by frost. There are tall varieties 
to train against the wall, and dwaris 
which form a little bush. They must 
have sunshine, but ask nothing else 
except water. Petunias are another 
standby — not the large-flowering sorts, 
which are not profuse bloomers, but 
the bedding kinds, which cover them- 
selves with color. Caliopsis, annual Lark- 
spurs, both tall and dwarf. Calendula, 
French and African Marigolds, Cali- 
fornia Poppy, annual garden Poppy, 
Candytuft and Sweet Sultan have all 
proved successful in a subsoil backyard. 
This may seem a limited list, but it 
will yield beauty from spring to 
autumn and repay the gardener a thou- 
sandfold. 



A Sympathetic Dog 

The fare at a certain boarding- 
house was very poor. A boarder who 
had been there for some time, because 
he could not get away, was standing 
in the hall when the landlord rang 
the dinner-bell. Whereupon an old

Hygienic Crumbles 

MISS CLEE who is an ardent 
theorist in the matter of hygienic 
living, concluded her somewhat tedious 
remarks by descending from generali- 
zations to concrete instances, as she 
nibbled at a cracker. 

"You say," she declared, with calm 
and patronizing pity in her tones, 
"you say that pepper and other condi- 
ments are not injurious if used in 
moderation. My friend, that is a 
ipistake. The lining of the stomach, 
as you know, is composed of a delicate 
membrane — almost exactly like the 
lining of the eye. Now, candidly, 
would you put pepper or mustard 
into your eye? You would not. And 
why? Because it would cause indes- 
cribable suffering. And so, although 
you may not be aware of the fact, 
the condiments that you take into 
your stomach cause inflammation and 
suffering, which you call indigestion. 
Do I make my point clear?" 

Fanner Grant moved uneasily in 
his chair; he had enjoyed the corned- 
beef dinner, and the only drawback 
to his enjoyment had been the sight 
of his guest nibbling crackers in pre- 
ference to his own more substantial 
meal. 

"I s'pose you've got the rights of 
the case," he admitted, grudgingly. 
"But I just couldn't stand it to live- 
on them hard-backed, wafer things 
that ain't got a speck of taste to 'em." 

"Try one," tu^ed the advocate of 
the simple life. 

Farmer Grant took the offered edible 
gingerly ; then a sudden thought smote 
him. 

"Turn about is fair play," he said. 
bluntly. "I'll give in that pepper 
and mustard and vinegar and sicb-

Miss Clee declined to rub "uhyfginic 
crumbles" in her eyes. 



LITTLE Prince Henry, aged 13, 
is the practical joker of tlie 
British royal family. Here is his latest. 
His sister, Princess Mary, wrote him 
the other day while he was visiting in 
Cornwall, asking him to send her some 
of the flowers which according to the 
newspapers were blooming in profusion 
in the "English Riviera." "You know 
how fond I am of early spring flowers," 
she wrote. Next day there arrived 
at Buckingham palace a beautifnl 
basket addressed to Princess Mary. 
The writing was that of Prince Henry. 
When the princess opened the basket 
she found, tastefully tied up with 
heliotrope ribbon, a hugh bunch d 
— cauliflower.

BOSTONS NEW FISH PIER 



Opening of Boston's New Fish Pier. Means Much 
to the Housewife 



By Frederick Roche 



THE opening of the new Boston 
Fish Pier, the $3,000,000 plant 
in South Boston, which is to 
take the place of Boston's famed T wharf 
as the center of the fresh fish industry 
of the Atlantic Coast, is an event of 
no small importance to American house- 
wives. It means that the country's 
fresh fish supply will be better handled 
and that the individual housewife will 
be able to get better fish for her table 
than ever before, and at no greater 
price. 

The officers of the Boston Fish Mar- 
ket Corporation, builders and managers 
of the vast and unique plant at South 
Boston, the largest and most complete 
fish market in the world, have set high 
ideals for themselves. They believe 



that to make the fresh fish business a 
success they must induce the housewife 
to use more fish, and that this can 
best be accomplished by placing a bet- 
ter grade of fish upon the market, and 
at the same time educating the house- 
wife to know good fish and to cook it 
properly. 

The actual work of setting their won- 
derful new plant in operation, once 
finished, the fish men plan a campaign 
of education for the consumer. They 
plan to show the man who eats fish and 
the woman who cooks it, that there 
may be a great deal of difference in 
the taste of two fish of the same variety, 
caught at the same time, but handled 
and cooked differently. They also plan 
to prove to the housewife that there 



748 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



are a number of varieties of fish not 
generally eaten — which at least the 
housewife would refuse to buy luider 
their trade name — which are really 
very tasty and have an extensive sale 
as food in other countries. 

The fish dealers have begun their 
work for the attainment of their ideal 
by constructing at South Boston the 
biggest pier in the world, given over 
exclusivUy to the fishing industry. 
This pier is of concrete and is 1 200 feet 
long and 400 feet wide. Upon it stands 
two rows of stores, also of concrete, 
clean and sanitary. The motto that 
cleanliness is next to godHness has been 
the watchword in the construction of 
the pier and no detail has been omitted 
which would work to keep the pier 
absolutely clean. Adequate drainage 
has been provided and facilities ar- 
ranged for washing every inch of the 
pier and of the tile-lined stores each 
day. The fish dealers intend to see 
that absolutely no dirt is allowed to 
collect — a striking contrast to T wharf, 
which from the time it was first used 
as a fish pier, 30 years ago, went un- 
washed until it went out of existence 
as the center of the country's fisheries. 

Even the personal appearance of the 



employees of the new pier has been 
taken into account and the men who 
actually handle the fish have been pro- 
vided with neat uniforms, constantly 
changed, so that they will always pre- 
sent as clean an appearance as possible. 
The facilities for keeping the fish landed 
at the pier in excellent condition are 
unequaled anywhere. Ice, made in 
the great cold storage plant at the head 
of the pier, will be delivered, crushed, 
to the stores each morning and an effort 
will be made to see that all the fish 
landed is iced as soon as weighed. 

The reaction in favor of better hand- 
ling of fresh sea-foods has not stopped 
with the dealers, but its influence has 
been felt by the fishermen. They have 
had impressed upon them the fact that 
to get the best prices for their catch 
they must bring it to port and deliver 
it to the dealers in an A-I condition. 
The wholesale dealers believe that this 
movement for marketing better fish 
will extend before long to the retail deal- 
ers and expect that radical changes will 
be made in the handling of sea-foods 
by the last named. 

The fish dealers believe that the high 
price of meats and other food-stuffs is 
constantly calling the attention of the

housewife to the vast possibilities of 
fish and feel that, when these possibilities 
are realized by the women of this 
countryjthe extent of their business will 
rapidly increase. Fish men at T wharf 
claim that in the past a large percentage 
of the fish has been spoiled either by 
improper handling or cooking. The 
average housewife, they say, knows 
but one or two ways of preparing fish 
and these but imperfectly. A short 
time ago a cook-book prepared by the 
New England Fish Exchange was put 
on the market just to prove that the 
manner of preparing fish for the table 
can be varied indefinitely. Expert cooks 
have claimed any variety of fish can 
be prepared for the table so that it 
will be extremely palatable even for 
those who have a natural aversion for 
sea-foods. The United States govern- 
ment has set its cookery experts to 
work on the problem and there is rea- 
son to believe that before long the gov- 
ernment presses will be turning out 
expert advice for the housewives on the 
subject of preparing fish for the table. 



THE MODERN FISHING SCHOONER 

The average housewife, it is said, 
knows but half a dozen varieties of 
fish: cod, haddock, halibut, mackerel, 
salmon and swordfish. They frequently 
buy what is known as Boston "blue 
fish," in reality, pollock. This, the fish 
dealers say, is a strong argument in 
favor of giving more euphonious names 
to the salt water finny tribe which are 
used as food. It is a fact that the 
"salt cod fish," which the housewife

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



■ from which she makes fish 
balls, is frequently hake. It is also a 
fact that the housewife will not buy 
either pollock or hake under those 
names. 

While the fish dealers at Boston have 
no hope that the housewife will imme- 
diately adopt the government's sugges- 
tions about eating dog fish they believe 
it is a fact that the time is at hand for 
the American people to dismiss their 
prejudices against certain extremely 
palatable varieties of fish, prejudices 
due solely to the unfortunate appella- 
tions of these fish. 



The railroad facilities of the new pier 
have been so arranged that fresh fish 
can be shipped to all parts of the 
country. There is no reason why a 
housewife in the middle of the country 
should not be able to purchase excellent 
fish, at a reasonable figure, caught in the 
Atlantic Ocean and landed at Boston. 

The United States government has 
been trying for a long time to tell the 
housewife that its experts have found 
fish to be an excellent and a cheap food. 
The fish dealers of Boston are taking 
up the same work. Is the housewife 
ready to listen ?

Bucolic Opinions on Fletcherizing 



By Helen S. Gray 



WHEN Horace Fletcher was giv- 
ing a course of lectures at 
Elbert Hubbard's in East 
Aurora, he was accompanied by a stu- 
dent, Mr. Granger, who told what Flet- 
cherizing had done for him and illustra- 
ted his talkbydoing the deep knee-bend- 
ing exercise. It was remarkable with 
Tvhat ease he did it. "One of the tests 
of endurance used in gymnasiums", said 
he, "is that called the deep knee-bending 
exercise, which consists in lowering 
the body until it almost rests on the 
heels and then rising to full height. I 
underwent this test at Battle Creek 
and was able to do it almost 3000 
times in succession, but I was sore 
afterwards. Then I heard of Fletcher- 
izing and adopted it. At first, it took 
me about three hours a day to eat 
my meals, but in a week or ten days 
I had gained facility so that I could 
get through eating in the time that 
others do, and I found I was eating 
only one-half or two-thirds as much 
as I had formerly. After one month's 



experience with Fletcherizing, I went 
down to Yale to undergo some tests 
Prof. Irving Fisher was conducting. 
Few of the meat-eaters could do the 
knee-bending test more than 300 or 
400 times in succession, and after it 
could hardly walk down stairs, so 
weakened were their leg muscles by the 
ordeal. The maximum number of 
times reached by meat-eaters was 
800-900. One vegetarian athlete at 
Yale made a record of 1200 times with- 
out exhaustion, after which he ran 
around the gymnasium and walked 
several miles. At Battle Creek, a 
dozen of the vegetarian nurses and 
doctors had done the test 1800 times, 
and one did it 2400 times, after which 
he went on with his regular work. I 
did the knee-bending test 5002 times, 
without stopping, in two hours and 
nineteen minutes. I could have con- 
tinued for a while longer, but it was 
getting monotonous for the spectators. 
Then I had a plunge in the tank and 
felt no muscular soreness the next

day or afterwards. By a vegetarian 
diet and Pletcherizing I had eliminated 
fatigue toxins from my body." 

Talk about "the doins" and about 
Pletcherizing spread through the village 
and created no little amusement and 
scorn among those whose chewing 
is confined to a quid of tobacco. They 
did not attend Mr. Fletcher's lectures 
nor read his books. What they heard 
about Pletcherizing was that it means 
prolonged chewing, and their imagina- 
tions supplied the information as to 
how prolonged. 

"Eat and gi' done with it", was the 
hired man's comment on Pletcherizing, 
and his views represent the consensus of 
bucolic opinion. "They say that man 
Fletcher talks entertainingly about his 
theories in a way that 'ud call a horse 
from his oats. To chew so long any one 
'ud have to be a millionaire t' afford the 
time. Nobody 'ud hire a man t' 
work for him who minces around 
when he eats. The man that's quick t' 
eat is the one that's quick t' work. 
You watch a table full of men eatin'. 
Those that swaller her down and clean 



it up are the workers. Of course I 
don't believe in swallerin' food kuU 
nor that a man should choke himself 
t' death eatin'. I'd like t' take that 
man Pletcher arotmd and show him 
how animals eat. If you see 'em 
takin' a little dab out of the top of 
the heap and mindn' and lickin' 
around, you may know they ain't 
no good. The horse that at the first 
mouthful bites clear to the bottom 
of the manger and swallers it, is always 
a big strong horse. I've seen horses 
so crazy t' git t' their feed that they'd 
kick the side of the stall as they scooped 
up a mouthful of oats. I know a horse 
thirty years old that plants his feet 
on the cornstalks I feed him and then 
from the way he makes them corn- 
stalks disappear you'd think they was 
goin' down a cuttin' machine". 

Some of the waitresses adopted 
Pletcherizing, much to the contempt 
of the cook. Some lessons in physical 
culture they took were the last straw 
for her patience, and she told them 
she believed "in folks' gittin' physical 
culture out of their work". 



SPRING BLOSSOMS, JAPANESE FASHION 



A Fortnight in Berlin 

First Impressions of Young American Tourists 

By Mary D. Lindsay 



ONE afternoon in early July four 
of us, American girls, arrived 
for the first time in Berlin. 
Our impression as we passed through 
the suburbs was of bright cleanliness 
and red geraniums, and as we came to 
know the city better in the days that 
followed, this opinion deepened. Every- 
where are broad streets, neat white 
houses and well kept flower beds. 
There are no slums in Berlin, the people 
hide their poverty under a smiling 
front, for the government so orders it. 

We drove at once to our pension and 
there were introduced into a strange 
world. Up to the fourth story we went, 
and in a long dark hall met the stout 
and tightly laced Frau. She beamed 
upon us and, in very good English, bade 
us welcome. Her servants, however, 
spoke no English and we had to adopt 
an elaborate system of signs to explain 
our simplest wants. Even the bedroom 
furnishings surprised us. They were 
very elegant and, as we soon learned, 
very unstable. The beds were covered 
with what appeared to be lace curtains, 
and when we examined the bed clothes 
underneath we discovered that they 
consisted of a feather mattress stuffed 
in a huge white case. On a cold night 
this covering was deliciously warm, 
but at more temperate times there was 
no happy mean possible between smoth- 
ering with it or freezing without it. 
The room was so crowded with its other 
furnishing that my wardrobe of necessity 
stood in the hall. I found, to my 
horror, on observing it, that a large 
artificial palm adorned the top. As 
this palm shook threateningly whenever 
the door of the wardrobe was opened, 
my discomfiture may be imagined. 

With high hopes, as otu* lunch that 
day had been light, we heard the gong 



for supper. The dining-room was an- 
other revelation. Down the long tab'e 
ran a strip of gray crepe tissue paper. 
On this a lace doily reposed and, scattered 
at equal intervals, stood vases of bright- 
colored everlasting flowers. Artificial 
smilax woven in and out between the 
vases completed the effect. Around 
this table were seated a cosmopolitan 
group, and we, it seemed, were to separate 
and sit among them. In my position 
between a smiling Pole, who spoke no 
English, and an Englishwoman who 
plainly showed her disapproval of four 
girls alone in Berlin, I looked around 
for the others. Jane was working hard 
at a "ya*'and*'nein" conversation with 
an ugly little Dutchman ; Louise beamed 
in silence upon a black mustachioed 
charmer from Chili, and Bess, between 
two Germans, sat looking around at 
the rest of us. A surreptitious wink 
from her almost upset my social calm. 
After the meal, which was distressingly 
meager, with its queer smoked meats, 
raw fish and sour rye bread, we re- 
paired to the drawing-room for tea and 
conversation. Here three of us man- 
aged to draw together, and from the 
bulwark of each other's society to siu*- 
vey Louise. She had yielded to the 
charms of Chili and sat on a settle 
near him as he played the latest Ger- 
man ragtime. Incautiously she leaned 
back with disastrous results. The back 
of the settle was only ornamental, and, 
insulted with this rude treatment, it 
came down with a crash. 

After that mishap we fled and went 
out to view the city by lamp light. 
We arrived home to experience another 
example of German thrift. The porter 
retired at ten, so it was necessary to 
walk up the foiu- flights. By pushing 
a button the lowest stairs were lighted 
753 



754 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



for a minute and then plunged in dark- 
ness again. In that minute we were 
supposed to dash up that flight and 
push the next button, and so on, until 
worn and breathless we arrived at otir 
landing. Even in the day time we 
must needs walk down, for the porter 
could not be bothered to come up for 
us. And, indeed, we found this custom 
true in even the department stores 
of Berlin. One rides up and walks 
down. 

From this pension we sallied forth 
every day to see the city. Our trips 
to the American Express and to Cook's 
for mail led us along the Unter den 
Linden, that beautiful broad avenue 
with its palaces and interesting shops, 
each of which from its advertisements 
is the principle marketing place of the 
Kaiser. This street leads down to 
the stately archway called the Brandon- 
burg gate. It has five passageways, 
and soldiers stand constantly, on guard 
at the central one, through which none 
but the Kaiser may pass. This gate 
opens on the other side upon an avenue 
running, perpendicular to Unter den 
Linden, into the Victoria Platz. In 
the center of this square rises a huge 
coltimn adorned at the sunmiit with a 
flashing bronze victory. Marble statues 
of many of the generals in the Franco- 
Prussian War stand near the central 
column, and before the Reichstag, which 
faces the platz, rises the monument of 
Bismark, lord of all he surveys. We 
often crossed this square on our way to 
the Thier Garten which lies just across. 
This Thier Garten is a great park and 
through it runs the avenue of Victory. 
On either side of the broad white road 
the monarchs of Prussia and Germany, 
in white marble, stand at equal intervals. 
The brilliant flower beds around them, 
the dark trees behind, form a wonder- 
fully effective setting for all this mag- 
nificence. If you leave this road and 
wander through the daisy-starred grass 
under the beautiful shade trees, you 
will come suddenly upon a statue of 



Goethe or Schiller or some other Germail 
poet, and in one spot you will find a 
sand pile with many little children play- 
ing merrily. We sat down to watch 
the lovely scene one day, and were 
immediately accosted by a man with 
a ticket; "No thank you," we said, "we 
do not care for any." With much 
gesticulating he managed to convey to 
us the idea that one must buy a ticket 
before he can sit down. This offended 
our sense of the fitness of things and 
we rose at once. 

If you turn in the other direction 
along the Unter den Linden,you pass the 
Museum of Arms, a great armory of 
war implements dating from time im- 
memorial, the tmiversity buildings and 
the Royal Opera House. At this end 
the street widens out to a square, around 
which are grouped the royal palaces, 
the Dom and art galleries. One may 
visit these at a grice, and we went one 
day to the Emperor's winter palace. It 
is an enormous affair covering a whole 
block in itself. We donned huge carpet 
slippers, that our feet might not scratch 
the royal floor, and were led through a 
small portion of it. The guide explained, 
in German, the marvelous sights we 
saw. Magnificence of gold and silver, 
velvet hangings and frescoed ceilings 
past all imagining, it was far too gor- 
geous to be beautiful. From there we 
crossed the street to a building only 
less imposing, the royal stables. Here 
we journeyed past miles of horses 
and vehicles. Each prince must have 
his own carriage for every occasion 
and all are preserved that the people 
may observe them. So there are in- 
numerable royal baby carriages, dog 
carts and coaches. The royal harnesses 
fill yet another room. We were rather 
surprised to see but few royal automo- 
biles. There also is the favorite horse 
of Frederick the Great, stuffed; he has 
grown seedy with age, poor thing, and 
there, too, is the horse of the Emperor 
William. We came out and fled to the 
Dom, where seats are free. This is 



A FORTNIGHT IN BERLIN 



755 



the state church, quite as magnificent 
as the rest of Berlin; all the apostles 
and reformers stand in niches, and the 
stained glass windows show symbolical 
figures in many brilliant colors. Here, 
as elsewhere, the best pew is reserved 
for the Emperor. To the side of the 
church opens a chamber containing the 
tombs of former rulers. Certain spaces 
lie vacant in a manner that must seem 
but too suggestive to the present royal 
family. Nearby are two art galleries. 
The National Museum exhibits picttires 
of German artists only, and the Kaiser 
Fredrich has a fine collection of paint- 
ings from all times and countries. 
Here we were enraptured with our first 
view of Raphaels, Murillos, Rembrandts 
and Velasquez. 

As we went about we gradually 
learned the small tricks of the town 
that make life cheaper and easier; that 
taxis are delightfully inexpensive, that 
motor-buses cost next to nothing, if 
you sit on the wooden seats in back 
instead of the leather cushions farther 
front, and that they do not stop, but 
you must nin and leap on them as 
they slow down. We learned to buy 
"eis chocolade*' a delicious mixture 
of chocolate and whipped cream, and 
that, to order lemonade aright, we 
must ask for lemonade naturale citrone. 
We found a cheap restaurant on Unter 
den Linden, and learned where to buy 
opera tickets for less than fifty cents. 
The Royal Opera House was closed, 
but the Krol Opera produced Wagner 
very creditably. One is required by 
law to check his hat and coat there, 
and the least murmur during the per- 
formance is greeted with an angry hiss 
from the audience, who listen with true 
love of music and applaud vociferously 
between acts. We also discovered the 
charms of the Ice Palace where the most 
graceful dancing imaginable is performed 
by a ballet on skates. One grows ac- 
customed, too, to the omnipresent sol- 
diers. They stand guard at all the 
palaces; they march with playing bands 



past one's window at five o'clock in 
the morning, and many other times a 
day, and they are always visible, 
singly or in groups, on any street of 
the city. The small boys of Berlin, 
who here as elsewhere follow a brass 
band, must live in a continuous state 
of excitement. 

We went one Stmday to the Zoological 
Gardens to see the animals and the 
people. Everybody was there, and we 
sat fascinated watching the streams 
of humanity. Adorable chubby Ger- 
man children came in great numbers, — 
sweethearts in Sunday best, who made 
love quite openly, and the respectable 
aged as well. All sorts of costimies pro- 
menaded past, from the full-skirted 
French bonne to the latest creation in 
slimness from Paris. At simdown there 
was scarcely a vacant seat in the huge 
beer garden, adjoining. The crowd 
talked and laughed and listened to the 
two bands, which took ttuns banging out 
American coon songs and comic opera. 
This is only one of the many places in 
Berlin that is crowded on a Sunday, for 
that, as we were told, is the general 
holiday of the people who have no other 
play time. A trip up the Spree River, 
one other day, showed us literally miles 
of beer gardens, thousands of little 
tables covered with neat red cloths, 
set out under the trees. They are all 
packed on Sunday. 

We took two trips out from Berlin. 
One day we did what every one else 
does, went to Potsdam. In an Ameri- 
can Express Company motor you ride 
for twenty miles through the strange 
Grunewald forest. The griass tmder- 
neath is burnt yellow and tall straight 
pines, whose lower branches have died, 
reach up like brown poles to the top 
where dark pine growth casts a shade 
over the whole. At the end of the forest 
one changes to a motor boat and glides 
over a channing lake, past wooded 
shores and glistening castle towers, to 
meet the motor at the other side and 
ride to the inn at Potsdam. There i^

delicious dinner, which is thrown in 
with- the rest of the trip, awaits one, and 
after it you are prepared for sightseeing. 
We first visited the old church that 
Frederick the Great used to attend. 
It is hung with captured battle flags, 
which doubtless gives great satisfaction 
to the present Emperor when he comes 
to worship there. In this church Fred- 
erick lies buried. Napoleon once stood 
over his tomb and said to his men : **Take 
off your hats, gentlemen, if he had been 
living, I should never have been here." 
Then on past the summer palace of 
the Kaiser, full of modern magnificence, 
to Sans Souci, the home of Frederick. 
This is truly a beautiful place. The 
house itself, a long, one-storied building, 
is a marvel of simple elegance. Two 
rooms interested us especially, the li- 
brary lined with book shelves and looking 
out through long French windows on 
the beautiful terrace, and the chamber 
of Voltaire. Frederick, who hated him 
cordially, yet could not bear to part 
with him, had it especially prepared for 
a surprise when Voltaire was away on 
a visit. Monkeys and parrots decorate 
the walls and furnishings and point 
with pleasant satire to Voltaire's talk- 
ativeness, his vanity and ugliness. In 
the picture galleries we noticed that the 
benches were particularly narrow and 
hard. Frederick, we were told, had 
once seen a lackey asleep on a settle 
and had had these made uncomfortable 
on purpose. But the real charm of 
the place is in the grounds. There 
are fountains and statues near the 
house, and to one side a raised mound 
with eleven stone slabs, the resting 
place of Frederick's favorite hounds, 
where he wished to be buried himself. 
To the front of the house stretch 
magnificent terraces copied after Ver- 
sailles. They arc kept in perfect con- 
dition with flower beds and velvety 
lawns and nicely clipped boxwood, and 
to one looking down from the house to 
the fountain at the bottom they are 
a delight in their conventional loveliness. 



On our other trip we went out into 
the real country to a little place called 
the Spreewald. It is a very low fertile 
district through which branches of the 
Spree wind and interwind for many 
miles. The only roads are the water- 
ways and the people who hav'e always 
lived there still keep the old peasant 
costume. We took the train for Lubbe- 
nan and walked through sunny fields, 
abloom with onion flov/er and the bright 
blossom of the red bean, to the little 
town. It is a quaint old cobble stone 
village, where the plaster cottages open 
directly on the street and where we saw 
barefooted women spreading great piles 
of onions out on the pavement to dr\\ 
At the landing we stepped into a punt 
and were poled along all day. Our 
guide, with his great black mustache, 
was a revolutionary looking individual, 
and, indeed, we found that he was out 
of the good graces of the government. 
He had turned Socialist and had insulted 
his superior officer in the Army, so his 
license for poling had been taken away 
and he requested us to pay him unosten- 
tatiously that he might not be fined. 
Down a long staight avenue bordered 
with willows we glided, until the bend 
in the stream brought us into a bright 
hay field where forget-me-nots grew along 
the bank. We turned up a bypath for 
pond lilies once. Other travelers in 
their punts passed us, and once a load 
of bright red carrots on its way to mar- 
ket floated by. Often we came upon 
some small settlements, a few houses 
with flower beds around them, and prejtty 
peasant girls bustling about, and often 
our stream led through stretches of 
shady woodland. Little boys pelted 
us with cornflowers tied in nose gays, 
and scrambled eagerly for our pennies, 
and once the idyllic spell was broken 
Ijy cheap ragtime ground out of a hurdy 
gurdy. We spent the whole day in 
this i^caceful manner. 

One of our table acquaintances at 
the pension assured us that we had not 
seen the real Berlin. **Go along Fried-

erich Strasse after twelve," he said. 
Friederich Strasse is a narrow business 
street always crowded. It reaches the 
whole length of the city. **The Ger- 
mans may try to embrace you at that 
hour, but sla[) them and you will have 
no trouble." In spite of the fact that 
we were American, we hesitated, and 
left Berlin without seeing its life. 
Characteristically our last act in the 
city was to quarrel with the porter over 
his tip. We were glad we had seen the 



great clean city and we admired its 
handsome avenues and buildings. But 
we knew that the government was over 
it all, that it ate up huge taxes in all 
this grandeur, that every business had 
to report to it, and that even we, insig- 
nificant as we were, could not be sick, 
or leave the city without its knowledge, 
and this feeling irritated us. We longed 
for a freer air, and with real joy boarded 
the southbound train, and yet we wished 
we might visit Boston again. 



Wanderlust 



"It's joy-time again," shouts the robin, 
The dawn is a-throb with his cheer. 
And, in the ghid hush of the night-fall. 
Hear the hylas chant, far and near, 
Their heart-stirring chorus of welcome, 
To herald the green o' the year. 

"Come, Lightfoot," the low winds are calling, 

"The grass is of emerald sheen. 

Anemones whiten the wood- ways. 

Frail bluets are starring the green. 

And the 'red-wings' are flashing their fire 

In haunts where the swamp willows lean." 



"Gay-tassclcd are poplar and alder. 

And mellow the tint of the sedge. 

The fern:^ and the mosses are weaving 

Rare beauty by brook-side and ledge, 

A palpitant joy stirs the maples 

That brightens the whole woodland's edge.

"Come, Lightfoot, the patteran beckons. 
Come, haste while the morning is young. 
Where pranking the trail of the Maytime 
Your gypsy-gay blossoms have sprung. 
And music of gypsy-glad carols 
From thicket and tree-top is sung."

What Constitutes a Good Table? 



By Anna Mitchell 



THE answer to this question will 
vary as much as people vary. 
What is one man's meat is another 
man*s poison. A noted divine once 
said, **We judge people by what they 
can and what they cannot do without." 
It may seem a mundane mcithod by 
which to judge character, but this de- 
partment of household management 
certainly does throw side lights on the 
person behind the scenes. If the food 
is simple, well cooked and well served, 
we know that there is sincerity of pur- 
pose behind that home; but if the bill 
of fare consists of pretentious names of 
dishes that are intended to contain 
questionable ingredients, then we know 
that a p^ame of bhiff is being attempted 



by some one. If a person of intelli- 
gence is obliged to accept this as a 
steady diet, his self-respect will event- 
ually become impaired, for his standards 
of morality must necessarily become 
lowered. 

There are conditions that hold in the 
average boarding house and the second- 
class restaurant. A story is told of 
an Irish mechanic who changed his 
boarding house. A friend he had known 
at the first place met him one day and 
said: Well, Pat, how do you like the 
new boarding house? I hear they have 
napkins there." Napkins *'be blowed," 
replied Pat, **rd rather have corned 
beef and cabbage." It is evident that 
Pat preferred food to service. People

who are sensitive to environment will 
find that the digestive fluids are accel- 
erated or retarded by the way food is 
put on the table. A brain worker has 
a much more sensitive digestion than a 
laboring man; hence the necessity for 
him that table appointments shotdd be 
made attractive. At the sight of dirty 
table doth or badly washed dishes, he, 
at once, feels a lack of appetite. This 
is caused by the organs that supply the 
digestive fluids, shutting up at the sight 
of any thing repulsive and refusing to 
work. Hence flowers, bright silver, 
and dean table linen are necessary ad- 
juncts to the table of a brain worker. 

The French have acquired an envia- 
ble reputation as masters of the culinary 
art. Now this is due, first, to the fact 
that they are a people of artistic tem- 
perament, which ensures a sense of the 
fitness of things ; and, secondly, they have 
a great capadty for details. This, added 
to their thrifty ability to make a little 
go a great way, supplies what is most 
essential in the making of a good cook. 

The Germans and the English are 
noted for thdr thoroughness, therefore 
deanliness and system in their house- 
holds are thdr strong points, but the 
ability to make the table attractive is 
essentially a French prerogative. It is 
this feature of French life that appeals 
so strongly to moneyed Americans who 
have built up one entire section of Paris. 

But we are not concerned about those 
whose leisure and money enable them to 
seek and find that which is most accept- 
able to the palate, we are interested in 
finding some way by which the best 
things in home making may be brought 
within reach of the great mass of our peo- 
ple who must of necessity stay put. If 
any one staying in Paris shotdd stroll 
along the section of the dty where the 
public markets are situated about eight 
o'dock in the morning, he would meet 
any number of French women hturying 
home with a twine bag in their arms. 
In this bag are the vegetables they have 
just purchased. The total expenditure 



is not more than one frank (20 cents) 
and it has covered provisions for three 
meals. There will probably be a couple 
of soups made from the contents of the 
bag, besides vegetables served in solid 
form, and there is sure to be parsley for 
garniture. A little further on we will 
meet the baker's man canying a load 
of crisp, browned bread sticks on his 
shoulder. The French, like the English, 
depend entirely on the public bakery 
for their bread supply. They are very 
partial to French small cakes of which 
dessert usually consists, with the addition 
of fresh fruit. Unlike the English, com- 
parativdy little tea is drunk. 

The bigness which characterizes every- 
thing in this country leads to an 
extravagance in the average American 
table. Estimating dosely on food sup- 
plies is regarded as a form of meanness. 
We often hear of help, particularly Irish 
hdp, who throw up good places, because 
they think the mistress calculates more 
dosely on supplies than is consistent 
with what they have h^ard of this land 
of plenty. 

The Domestic Sdence Schools are 
doing much toward eradicating these 
false ideas. A great deal was expected 
from the introduction of cooking into the 
public schools, some years ago, but it is 
quite doubtful whether the results, in 
practical making of the homes, have 
justified expectations. 

The pupil, in many cases, takes home 
modernized methods only to be met with 
strong opposition from her mother's hard 
and fast habits, which she is not inclined 
to change at the young person's dictum. 

How many old housekeepers sniff at 
a cookbook. I have heard them say, 
**I never measure anything, I just use 
my own judgment." Now they do not 
advert to the difficulty of transferring 
this judgment, acquired by long years 
of practice, to the young novice, without 
the assistance of rules. Occasionally 
you will find a mother of rare common 
sense, who will see the necessity of train- 
ing her daughter early in systematic 



WHAT CONSTITUTES A GOOD TABLE?

maimer. The instructon received in this 
way is the most valuable. The mother 
when properly equipped is the best 
teacher of the household art, 

A friend of mine, who is very particular 
about her table, says the earliest thing 
she can remember her mother saying is, 
"If you serve only bread and butter, see 
that it is put on the table in an appeti- 
zing manner. 

There is an unsolved problem confront- 
ing people who are obliged to board 
and this number increases as the various 
avenues of employment for women 
have increased. In boarding * 'there are 
many men of many minds" to be satis- 
fied. How can the proper average of 
food and service be brought about at a 
minimum cost? Three wholesome, well 
cooked dishes are better than six lacking 
in these requirements. We have become 



a nation of dyspeptics, because we eat too 
many different things and thus place 
on the digestive organs too much strain 
in the effort to assimilate. 

The Public Gjonnasium and the 
Public Lectures on Hygiene have done 
much, in recent years, toward educating 
the public in the best way to avoid the 
necessity for taking drugs. What we 
need now are free lectures on dietetics, 
so that girls who are about to assume 
the responsibility of housekeepers may 
learn the value of foods. If some of the 
time now given, by yotmg matrons, to 
bridge could be conserved and directed 
to a systematic study of cookery, the 
beneficial results would be far reaching. 
Fewer people who can keep house would 
take refuge in the boarding house, and 
who shall say that the number of divorces 
would not be lessened thereby? 



The Road 



There's a lusty bluebird singing, where the 

purplf lilacs sway. 
There s a drift of apple blossoms where the 

wanton breezes play: 
And the trilliums, pale beauties, their pearly 

censers swing, — 
For in the fragrant forest depths they hear the 

voice of Spring. 

Here's a flash of gold a-blow in the young 
broom trees, — 

Overhead a mist of green courts the scented 
breeze. 

Come, oh, come a-gypsying, come to Spring- 
time's meet, — 

You with yearning faces leave the bustling 
city's street. 

There's a blue-eyed violet peeping through a 
fern-embroidered screen: — 

There's a turquoise sky above us raining dew- 
drops for its queen. 

April weeps, then, with a sunbeam, laughing 
dries her azure eyes. 

And a knot of rainbow ribbons 'midst her 
golden locks she ties. 

Here's the road to summer days, o'er the path 

of Spring — 
Merry May is just ahead, where the hawthornes 

swing. 
Who this maid will follow, hasten lagging feet, — 
Laugh, and flee the shadows, dreary, in the 

city's street.

Eliminating Non-Essentials 



By Eleanor Robbins Wilson 



EVERY successful housekeeper 
who is a satisfaction alike to 
the inmates of her* household 
and herself, in some early stage of the 
domestic routine, has experienced a 
great sifting process and thereby con- 
clusively settled the perplexing opera- 
tion of separating home-making essen- 
tials from non-essentials. 

While each home is a law unto itself, 
and each home-keeper's problems are 
largely individual, all share the common 
desire for the best mode of procedure 
in dispatching their duties and crave 
the common reward of increased free- 
dom. **A wide margin of leisure is 
as beautiful in a man's life as in a 
book", said Thoreau. Had these lines 
been penned during the last decade, 
they might have read, — ''A wide 
margin of leisure is as beautiful in a 
woman* s life as in a book**; and the 
heartiest feminine "amens" to the 
sentiment would come from the house- 
keeping contingent. 

How, then, are we to attain this 
desired leisure? 

Only by becoming efficient workers 
and managers. To be the first means 
merely living up to Grandmother's 
adage, *'make your head save your 
heels", plus the intelligent use of 
twentieth century labor saving devices. 
To be the second means mastering the 
art of conserving all the good things 
which contribute to the artistic and 
material comfort of the home. Prom- 
inent among these good things are 
time, money, and the house mother's 
health. 

Owing to the fact that the domestic 
woman remains at home while the 
husband, out in the fray of business 
affairs, is continually enlarging his 
mental horizon through new view- 
points, it often happens that the two 



grow apart and are more widely sep- 
arated in later years than when they 
first came together. It, therefore, 
becomes the absolute duty of each 
housewife to arrange her household 
affairs so that each day she may be able 
to devote some definite period, however 
small, to the broadening of her interests. 
Prentice Mulford tells us that it is 
thinking the same thoughts that ages 
us most, and that new thought is new 
life. So brightening otir prosy, house- 
hold planning with fresh, recreative 
ideas becomes of paramount importance. 

The only short-cut to this coveted 
leisure lies through system. In other 
words, it means an intelligent survey 
of each day's necessary duties, classi- 
fying them as regards relative import- 
ance and then performing them with a 
due regard to sequence. 

I know of no more profitable under- 
taking for the average housekeeper 
than an occasional minute criticism 
of her methods. One by one, let her 
review her daily duties and find just 
where her waste energ}'' is going. Each 
period of such concentration should 
bear fruit. And it is only by apphdng 
improvement that we can hope to lift 
the performing of common household 
drudgery to the dignity of a science 
and the art of home-making to a 
profession. 

Not long ago, an acquaintance of 
mine wore a pedometer dtu*ing her 
morning work and foimd, in an incredibly 
short space of time, that it registered 
three miles! It is needless to add that 
today finds her eliminating many non- 
essentials and the proud possessor of 
some worthwhile labor-savers. 

So, my dear homekeeper, let me 
repeat the admonition to face your 
several duties and try to lay your 
finger on the weakness thereof. It

ELIMINATING NON-ESSENTIALS

you are making yoiirself foot-weary 
and uncompanionable through unneces- 
sary steps, canvas the question thor- 
oughly and see how it may be avoided. 
Perhaps, the answer lies in curtailing 
the dusting by putting away super- 
flous bric-a-brac, silver, fumittire, etc., 
in fact, everything that does not 
directly contribute to the comfort or 
well-being of the family. Or, may be, 
a separate set of working utensils for 
the upper floor, a re-arrangement of 
the Idtchen furniture, or simply a 
large tray for removing dishes from 
the table would obviate the trouble. 
A desirable papier-mache tray, size 
22 X 16 inches, sells for $1.25. Its 
light weight and cheapness are suffi- 
cient recommendation. Perhaps, you 
are spending a disproportionate length 
of time in ironing. During the hot 
months there are many times when 
paper doilies may be substituted for 
linen ones. These come in both round 
and oval patterns. The latter shape 
placed over asbestos mats serve admir- 
ably for the hot dishes. The use of 
paper napkins will often save laundering 
damask, and there are many occasions 
when paper toweling answers one's 
purposes most effectually. 

Many young mothers are simply 
martyrs to pride. Babies certainly 
do look adorable in white, but there 
are innumerable times when dark frocks 
may be used to advantage and even 
when rompers should take the place 
of dresses. In the choice of fabrics, 
too, lies another means of time-saving. 
Seersucker, Japanese nets, and cotton 
crepes require no ironing, and the 
latter material is as desirable for 
undergarments as for gowns, and is 
the ideal underwear cotton for the 
home^abiding as well as the traveling 
woman. 

Cooking and dish-washing are time- 
consimiers. But even these may be 
simplified and performed in shorter 
periods by the employment of proper 
culinary implements, Bre^d £^nd cake 



mixers are almost indispensable, paper- 
bag cookery has its welcome niche, 
doing away with the washing of greasy 
pans, and the fireless cooker, at times, 
proves itself a boon. Doubtless there 
is no more valuable help for the cookery 
problem than the study of nutritive 
food values, and learning to serve a 
dietary appropriate to the season. 
During the summer months we shall 
gain in health as well as time by letting 
fresh fruit and plain ice cream take 
the place of rich puddings and pies, 
in discarding heavy meats and gravies 
for succulent vegetables, nut and egg 
dishes, and by partaking of an occas- 
ional picnic luncheon in the garden or 
on the veranda. The use of paper 
plates in the refrigerator is by no 
means a small help in the lessening of 
dish-washing. Size 6x7 sell at $.40 a 
hundred, while those measuring 8x9 
are $.50 per hundred. 

In planning her moments for recrea- 
tion, the efficient housewife has, per- 
force, become Janus-faced. She has 
learned that it is yesterday's lack of 
repairs that too often robs tomorrow 
of its play-hour. • The gap in the screen 
that keeps her swatting flies, the refrac- 
tory damper that takes extra time to 
coddle, the broken spring on the door 
that necessitates extra steps, the clogged 
pipe, etc., that are a drain on both 
time and money, cheat her of the mo- 
ments which might richly be used in 
more advantageous directions. In the 
domestic realm, as elsewhere, it is 
"trifles that build the tomb of great 
things." 

The modem housekeeper has no 
better yardstick for measuring the 
progress of her domestic ideals than a 
backward glance at out- worn methods; 
no better way of counting her riches 
than enumerating the thousand and 
one golden advantages that have blos- 
somed in the place of her fore-mpther's 
essentials. 

One of the best housekeepers I 
know is a woman who has outgrown 



762 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



the semi-annual orgy of house-cleaning, 
and her shining panes and fresh window 
draperies are but an outward adver- 
tisement of the indoor cleanliness and 
order. This house is an average home, 
but the smooth-running of its domestic 
machinery makes it unusual in many 
respects. The laundry is in the base- 
ment. On the first floor there are four 
rooms, reception hall and pantry; on 
the second floor, four chambers and 
bath. The maid's room, storeroom and 
quarters for keeping traveling para- 
phernalia are on the third. It is this 
third floor that differs so widely from 
the customary attic, inasmuch as the 
storeroom harbors not outworn cloth- 
ing, decrepit house fiunishings, crippled 
furniture or files of old papers and 
magazines. It is the rule of this house- 
hold that nothing useless or outgrown 
be kept. If broken furniture is worthy 
of restoration, it is immediately repaired 
and again pressed into general usage. 
If it seems wise to discard it, it is either 
given where it may render further 
service, sold to the junkman or sent to 
the chopping-block. Magazines, proving 
sufficiently valuable, are bound and 
added to the family library, others 
are sent to the Salvation Army or some 
place where they will be equally wel- 
come, while all cast-off clothing is 
charitably passed on. Thus, the store 
room is an orderly apartment, containing 
a few chests and a number of neatly 
labeled boxes wherein are housed the 
family furs, winter clothing and bedding 
in summer, and vice versa. 

The floors are of hard wood through- 
out this home. From week to week 
the rugs are given careftd attention 
and, at regular intervals, like the 
mattresses, receive a thorough sunning 
and airing. Light-weight blankets are 
laimdered with the home washing, 
while heavier ones are cleansed by 
professional cleaners. Painting, paper- 
ing, floor polishing, and general repairing 
are done at opportime moments and 
draperies are laundered as frequently 



as necessary. Thus the old-time cyclonic 
upheavals, dignified as Spring and 
Autunm housecleaning, are unknown 
disturbances in this ever-attractive 
abode. 

All hail to the modem domestic 
science that is teaching the habit- 
bound housewife the value of eflS- 
ciency — that intelligently directed en- 
deavor in the home plays a colossal 
part in making the world over into a 
more satisfactory dwelling place! It 
is an occupation of the most compre- 
hensive scope, and we cannot separate 
it from, any of the interests which 
enter people's lives. 

We read much in present day jour- 
nals tending to show that up-to-date 
women can not afford to waste either 
time or money in doing housework. 
Housework, they tell us, we shall get 
rid of by gradual socialization. One 
after another we shall turn over the 
various branches of home work — 
cleaning, sweeping, bed-making, cook- 
ing, etc., to business organizations. 
We shall then be free to throw the 
weight of our intelligence and support 
into the larger civic housekeeping, — to 
raise the standard of health, schools 
and roads in our respective commimi- 
ties. But the question arises, would 
this greater freedom from household 
duties build entirely for social uplift? 

I believe that the rank and file of 
American housewives are less ambitious. 
They are content, as yet, just to lift 
their household operations to a business 
basis, to have the tools of their craft, 
and to know how to use them effi- 
ciently, — which, in other words, spells 
a small margin of leisure. 

While few of us can attain to the 
idealism of Hamlet's words, "There 
is nothing either good or bad but 
thinking makes it so", we know the 
mental attitude which we bring to our 
labors has much to do with the quality 
of our work and, indirectly, in the effect 
of our work upon us. Home-making 
to countless women is still a labor of

love and robbing the home of its 
industry would be like removing its 
very heart. A home divorced of its 
industry must lieeds forfeit much of 
its individuality and atmosphere — 
two of its most precious possessions — 
to take in the commonplaces of the 
public hostelry. Is not privacy one 
of the most hallowed features of our 
homes? 

To me, prevailing conditions seem 
rather to call for a firmer grounding 
in household economics, which is pro- 
ductive of inventiveness. And inven- 
tiveness, as we all know, leads to better 
and quicker ways of doing things. It 
develops a finer discernment of essentials 
and non-essentials, and alertness of 



vision wherein we learn **to keep the 
eye single" to the proper valuation 
of comfort. For the crown of home- 
making is happy living. Therefore, 
the solution of the problem lies not in 
wholly shedding household tasks, but 
in discovering such elimination of non- 
essentials as is practicable. 

We grumble much about being bound 
to the wheel of complex living, when, 
in reality, we are frequently only 
tethered by trifles. Let us begin today 
to ascertain the true essentials of home- 
keeping and into the limbo of dis- 
carded things we shall not only toss 
many inferior methods, but much of 
our false pride, our pseudo-hospitality 
and our slavery to * 'appearances**. 



A Square Deal for the Milk Bottle 

By Alice E. Whitaker 



WHEN bu)dng milk do not hunt 
for bargains. Find a reput- 
able dealer, ask for proof that 
his milk is of low bacterial count and 
then be willing to pay a reasonable 
price. In any city and in many large 
towns, it is possible to go to the office 
of the Board of Health and see the 
score card of your milk man; this will 
help you to judge of the quality of his 
milk. 

In cities, it is scarcely possible to buy 
good milk at less than ten cents a 
quart and special milk for babies is 
often twelve and fifteen cents a quart 
and is well worth the price. Remember 
that this milk is safer than the tra- 
ditional **milk from one cow" that our 
mothers were so anxious to get for 
their little ones. 

Housewives, who can remember the 
tin cans used some years ago, now realize 
the advantage of the glass bottles which 
show the amount of cream and, what 
is yet more important, they disclose 
any dirt which always means danger. 



No matter of whom you buy milk, it 
is wise occasionally to lift the bottle 
high enough to look straight up at the 
bottom of it. If there is the slightest 
sediment or discoloration, make com- 
plaint at once. Make this examination 
yourself, for when asked about it the 
milk man, if dishonest, may give the 
bottle a sly shake and deftly hold it in 
the air for a second to prove that there 
is no sediment visible. 

In 1630, when John Cotton is credited 
with sa)dng that nothing was cheap 
in the Colonies but milk and ministers, 
it is recorded that milk was but a 
penny a quart in Salem, Massachu- 
setts. At that rate, it probably mattered 
little if a half pint was wasted now and 
then, or if two or three quarts turned 
thick and was given to fowls or pigs. 
Today the situation is altogether differ- 
ent. The housewife considers carefully 
whether she shall take a pint or a quart 
and, at ten cents a quart, she is care- 
ful that none goes to waste. When 
water will answer the purpose as well 



764 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



in cooking, she makes it take the place 
of milk. 

Milk should have at least thirteen 
per cent of solids, but there is too much 
fear of dilution by water and too 
little attention paid to other dangers 
to its quality that may come from the 
kitchen. The producer of the milk 
and the man who handles it for market 
may have taken care to have it of gilt- 
edge quality, yet the woman in the 
kitchen can undo all their work in a 
very few minutes, for kitchen sanita- 
tion is yet in the elementary stage. 

When the milk bottle, taken from the 
back or front steps, is carried directly 
to the pantry or refrigerator, stop and 
think what may have happened. The 
prowling cat, looking at the cream 
through the glass, sometimes laps the 
top of the bottle hoping for a stray 
drop. The bottle that stands for two 
or three hotirs between the milk man's 
early call and your breakfast time 
gathers a coating of dust, although it 
may not be noticeable. If the top of 
the bottle is not wiped off, this dust or 
other contamination is washed into 
the milk as it is poured from the bottle ; 
therefore, it is better to wipe off the 
rim or neck of the bottle with a wet 
cloth as soon as the milk is brought 
into the house. 



While milk should be kept cold and 
in the bottle, replacing the little cap 
at once after any is poured out, man>' 
housekeepers hasten to empty it into 
a pitcher before it is set into the refrig- 
erator. Perhaps the pitcher was wiped 
with a dish towel, instead of being 
scalded and inverted; possibly, after 
filling with milk, it is left standing 
on the kitchen table for an hour or so, 
in spite of the fact that exposure in a 
warm place is certain to be followed b}' 
development of harmful bacteria. 

When the last of the milk is used, 
the bottle should be washed and not 
allowed to stand about the kitchen, to 
be taken hurriedly to hold tea and 
coffee or perhaps acid or greasy liquids. 
It is true that at the milk stations, 
or where the milk is bottled, the bottles 
are washed and sterilized, yet they 
should always be kept for their la\s^ul 
purpose of holding milk. 

Put bottles out each day. It is a 
common fault of both mistress and 
maid to allow from three to even seven 
or eight bottles to acctmiulate before 
they are set out. This increases the 
work of the milkman even to the 
point of making an extra trip for col- 
lecting what could be handled easily 
in the morning's delivery, if the bottles 
were returned systematically each day. 



Arcady 



Know you the wonder-land that smiling lies 
Just on beyond the turning of the way. 
Where every mead is blossom-pied, and skies 
Are bluer than the depths where salt waves 

play? 
Know you that fair land dreaming in the sun? 
Tis there old Pan his reed-born magic blows, 
In some dim glen where murmuring waters run 
And where each listeninp^ leaf its emerald throws. 
This is the realm of visions and of song. 
Beyond the world's pain-laden thoroughfare, 
Sweet as the fancies to young lovers born; 
Nor is the sunset's pearl and rose more fair.

Polly's Course in Designing 



By Elsie Spicer Eells 



I 



DO believe that is the school 
teacher coining up the hill," 
said Mrs. MacDougall as she 
looked up from the doughnuts she 
was frying. **ril just have time to 
finish these doughnuts and put on a 
clean apron before she gets here. I 
wonder if it is John or Joe who has 
been getting into a scrape." Mrs. 
MacDougal had never been favored 
with a visit from the school teacher 
when some of her brood had not been 
transgressing. 

"I came to talk with you about your 
daughter, Polly," said the teacher as 
she struggled to regain her breath after 
the long climb up the hill to the Mac- 
Dougall farm. "Polly!" exclaimed her 
mother in amazement! **What has 
Polly been doing? I thought that, of 
course, it was one of the boys who had 
been up to some mischief." The 
teacher explained smilingly that it was 
not a misdemeanor this time which 
had prompted her visit. Polly Mac- 
Dougall was .the most artistic child it 
had ever been the teacher's privilege 
to instruct. **I hope," said she, "that 
you will see to it that Polly has the 
opportunity to cultivate her talents." 

Mrs. MacDougall, busy mother of 
seven that she was, did not forget the 
teacher's words as the years went by. 
The boys left school early, but Polly 
was allowed to go to the high school 
in the neighboring town. Mr. Mac- 
Dougall, however, had his own ideas 
about Polly's High School course. His 
brother's daughter in the city was 
earning w^hat seemed to Mr. MacDougall 
a fabulous sum as a stenographer. He 
asjjired to have Polly do likewise and 
his brother had told him that a steno- 
grapher who was a High School grad- 
uate secured a better position than one 
who was not. 



"Will you have to be a stenographer 
after all?" asked Polly's art teacher, 
to whom she had confided her aspira- 
tions and fears. Polly had only one 
year more in High School and there 
was a course in designing at the Insti- 
tute in the city upon which she had 
set her heart. It was a very modest 
little dream, for it was a one year's 
course. Polly knew that course would 
enable her to earn enough money to 
carry her on to further heights. The 
most tantalizing thing about it was 
that it would cost only a little more 
than the course in stenography which 
her father wished her to take. "I 
think mother sympathizes with me," 
Polly said, "but father's heart is so 
completely set on the stenography 
that I'm afraid there is no other way." 

The idea of the "other way" pre- 
sented itself to Polly one Saturday, 
when she accompanied her mother on 
a rare trip to the city to do some shop- 
ping. They passed a" wonderful shop 
window where "steamer baskets" full 
of fruit were displayed. Polly's artistic 
eye saw ways of arranging the fruit 
even more attractively and her nimble 
fingers longed to try. Polly was very 
quiet on the way home. At last, she 
said, "Mother, why couldn't I arrange 
farm baskets for Thanksgiving and 
Christmas gifts? I wonder if the stores 
that sell steamer baskets wouldn't 
let me display some baskets, just to 
see if they wouldn't sell." Mrs. Mac- 
Dougall saw no objection to the plan 
and the art teacher was very enthu- 
siastic about it, when Polly talked 
the idea over with her. She volunteered 
to go with Polly to make arrangements 
at the shops. 

Thanks to the art teacher's persua- 
sive eloquence and Polly's eager eyes,

'^Economics changes man's activities. 
As you change a man's activities you 
change his way of living, and as you 
change his environment you change his 
state of mind. Precept and injunction 
do not preceptibly affect men; but food, 
water, air, clothing, shelter, pictures, 
books, music, will and do affect them." 

**He who makes war on business 
removes the roof from homes, takes the 
bread from mouths, leaves htmian bodies 
naked to the storm — replaces confi- 
dence with fear, hope with dread, love 
with hate — and robs men of their 
right to work." 



WOMAN'S PROBLEMS 

THE franchise for women in the 
United States is coming. That it 
has not been granted more speedily is 
a matter of surprise, for, in general, the 
men of this coiintry are inclined to 
give their women whatever they ask 
for, we might say, everything they take 
a fancy to. In some states, what is 
called machine politics is largely at 
fault, for the continued rebuff of peti- 
tions for woman suffrage; in other 
states — notably Massachusetts — the 
spirit of conservatism, which has fas- 
tened itself on both men and women is 
cause of the backwardness in accepting 
or adopting this destined reform. 

But with the possession of the ballot, 
not all of woman's problems will be 
solved ; suffrage for women will not usher 
in a millennium of peace and leisure. 
Housework and housekeeping must go 
on just the same, and yet time be found 
to aid in the conduct of affairs of town 
and state. Women of means, whose 
children have already been placed in 
life, may find pleasure and profit to 
themselves and in a measure be useful 
to the state by entering upon these 
larger fields of activity. But how about 
the wife of the young man and the pro- 
fessional man with salaries of less than 
two thousand dollars a year? 

To get rid of the drudgery of house- 
work is the cry of many women to-day. 
Is not the teaching of children as mon- 
otonous as housework ? Does not teach- 
ing keep both the men and women 
engaged in it as tied down and tmable 
to take part in the things that are thought 
to give a broader view of life as does 
housekeeping or homemaking f 

There is one phase of this revolt from 
the kitchen that has not yet been 
fully presented; it is well known that 
bread, meat, delicatessen supplies, etc., 
provided from outside of the home, 
cost about twice as much as the same 
items prepared in the home, and, at 
the same time, the former are rarely 



feDitORIALS

^qual to the latter in nutritive value 
and flavor. How is this discrepancy to 
be made good ? More families are living 
on two thousand dollars per year or 
less than on incomes above that figure. 
Not every young woman can earn the 
difference in cost of food cooked at 
home and cooked food bought outside 
the home. 

French women, it is said, take hold 
enthusiastically and become co-workers 
with their husbands in the conduct of 
their business, knowing full well that 
CO partnership is needful to support 
a family. The time is rapidly approach- 
ing in this country, even if it be not 
already here, when women in some 
way must help either in keeping down 
the expenses of the household or in 
adding to the income of the family. 
Natural fitness should decide which 
procedtu'e is best adatped to each 
individual case. And, besides, the time 
has not come when all women are 
desirous of throwing overboard the 
responsibilities of individual home-mak- 
ing. J. M. H. 

AESOP ON EATING 

MR. AESOP, owing to the pecu- 
liar , form which he gave his 
yams, is usually thought of as the 
George Ade of ancient Greece, we 
believe. One of his fables —that one 
about the attempt of the members to 
freeze out the stomach —ranks him, 
in the mind of the dietitian, at least, as 
the Horace Fletcher of Doric days. 
You know — the hands and mouth and 
the teeth one day had the primeval 
equivalent of a htmch that the stomach, 
while it got all the food, yet did none of 
the work. An equitable distribution of 
labor : that was what they wanted, and 
wanted quick. It is not told that they 
took the time to suggest a get-together 
conference with an eighteen-course ban- 
quet, or that they even suggested a com- 
promise. What they did was to cut off 
forthwith the enemy's food-supply. 
The hands agreed to carry no more 



food to the mouth, the mouth to receive 
none, and the teeth to chew none — 
which action of the teeth showed no 
daring originality, it seems to us, in 
view of the resolution already taken by 
the hands and the mouth. The inevit- 
able happened. The members were 
soon overwhelmed with fatigue; the 
hands felt like a ton of fabulous brick, 
and the mouth became parched and 
dry and the legs wobbly. A council of 
work was held and the strikers voted 
to return to their jobs, freely admitting 
that the stomach in a modest way had 
been keeping up its end, and that in 
co-ordination of all the members of the 
body alone is there strength. 

There, we submit, is a good fable. 
It points the larger lesson of co-operation 
and getting down to practical hygiene 
shows the inter-relation of the various 
digestive functions. We cannot speak 
for Aesop's subscribers, but certainly 
many men and women of to-day have 
yet to learn that the stomach is not 
placed in the system for ormanental 
purposes; that it has very vital work to 
do; and, above all, that conditions must 
be favorable, if it is to be efficient work. 
The usefulness of the hands and of the 
mouth and teeth in feeding most people 
take for granted and let* the matter 
stop there, when, as a matter of fact, 
the work of digestion has scarcely 
begun. The teeth have chewed the food 
(if one is a fletcherizer) and the saliva 
has mixed with it a substance or 
**enzyme" called "ptyalin", which 
changes the starchy portion of the food 
into dextrine and maltose, the only 
forms in which the system can assimilate 
starch. In the stomach there takes 
place the equally important work of 
digestion of the nitrogenous part of the 
meal — such foods as lean meat, beans, 
peas, cheese, eggs and most nuts. 

And yet we think the stomach has 
nothing to do ! A fair amount of nitro- 
genous food it could get away with, but 
three meals of the ordinary sort, it has 
been found by careftd experiment, give 



768 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZlNfi 



the stomach twice the amount of work 
it was meant to do. The result? — 
Huge amounts of food leave the stomach 
in an undigested state and rot (by all 
means, let us be Anglo-Saxon where 
possible) in the intestine, giving off 
poisons that are carried by the blood- 
stream to every part of the body for 
the crippling of muscles and nerves. 
Conmion results of -these poisons are 
headaches and biliousness, for which 
we usually blame the poor, overworked 
stomach, which itself has been seriously 
affected by the poisonous processes. 

Thus we see how the stomach is at 
the mercy of a perverted appetite, and 
how important is good team-work be- 
tween the stomach, on the one hand, 
and the selection of food, both as to 
amotuit of nitrogen present and to quan- 
tity, on the other. 

Pure foods, for which we are fighting 
so valiantly to-day, also play an impor- 
tant role in stomach digestion, for 
poisons taken into the system in impure 
foodsare quite as vicious as the poisons 
formed in the intestine from too much 
food. 

Fiuther team-work should exist between 
the mind and the stomach. One does 
not need to be a psychotherapist to 
believe in the influence of mental states 
upon digestion. Professor Pawlow of 
St. Petersburg, experimenting upon dogs 
fotmd that, when the animals were 
annoyed, the flow of gastric juice ceased, 
while when they were in a playful mood, 
the gastric juice flowed in abundance. 
Music, it was shown, especially stimu- 
lates the flow of the juice, so that even 
the cabaret might be made to assist a 
recreant digestion. 

Again, the stomach shares the general 
tone of the system. If the body is 
tuned up to concert pitch, so that it 
rings true and responds readily to the 
demands made upon it, the stomach, 
other things being equal, will be found 
working efficiently. If, on the other 



hand, the system is all nm down the 
chances are the stomach will be doing 
the work of half a stomach. For this, 
if for no other reason, exercise is impor- 
that — especially outdoor exercise, — 
also deep breathing, fresh-air sleeping, 
plenty (but not too much) sleep, just 
enough food of the right kind, and whole- 
some, cheerful thoughts. These are 
simple things that keep us keyed up for 
strenuous living, the stomach no less 
than the rest of the body. x. c. o'd. 



SPRING 



There's a glinting of blue, there's a sprinkle of 
gold. 
There's a haze in the skies over head. 
There's a budding of leaf, there's a stirring of 
life 
In the heart of the hyacinth bed. 
From the maple a voice from the willow a sign. 

From the marshes soft odors that bring 
To the eyes that can see, to the ears that can 
hear. 
The news of the coming of Spring. 

There's a voice in the breeze, there's a sign in 
the sun. 
That whispers of Winter's farewell; 
There's a mist o'er the lake, there's the call of 
a bird. 
There's the echoing tones of a bell. 
There's a song in my heart though my hands 
to their task. 
The task of the winter must cling. 
And my soul makes reply to earth, ocean and 
sky. 
A welcome — a welcome to Spring!

Canapes, Indienne 



POUND in a wooden bowl one- 
fourth a cup, each, of chopped, 
cooked ham and chicken; add 
one-fourth a cup of butter, one table- 
spoonful of chutney, one-fourth a tea- 
spoonful, each, of curry powder and pap- 
rika and salt as needed , and pound again ; 
then press through a sieve. Have 
ready some rounds, diamonds or finger- 
shaped pieces of bread, buttered and 
browned in the oven and then cooled. 
Spread these with the mixture, set a 
slice of hard-cooked egg in the center, 
and the canapfe are ready. 

Tomatoes a la Tartare 

Very small hot-house tomatoes are 

usually selected for this dish, served 



as a prelude to a formal luncheon or 
dinner. Hot-house tomatoes are easily 
peeled without recourse to boiling water, 
which impairs the flavor, a chief re- 
quisite in an appetiser. Remove a 
portion of the tomato around the stem, 
to make space for a small spoonful of 
sauce tartare. Chill the tomatoes thor- 
oughly, set them on croutons of bread 
(prepared as above), fill with the 
sauce and serve at once. Small salad 
forks should be provided for this hors 
d'oeuvre. 

Clam Croquettes 

Canned clams may be used. If fresh 
clams are at hand, scrub and wash the 
shells thoroughly, and rinse in cold 
water. Put them into a large saucepan 
with about a cup of boiling water* 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



cover and let steam until the shells 
open. Remove the clams from the 
shells, retaining all the liquid. Let 
the liquid settle, then strain through a 
cloth. Chop the clams, but not too 
fine. For eight large croquettes, melt 
one-third a cup of butter; add one-third 
a cup of flour, a scant half-teaspoonful, 
each, of salt and paprika, and let cook 
until the flour is absorbed; add one cup 
of the clam broth and one-fourth a cup 
of cream and stir until the sauce is 
smooth and boiling; add one teaspoon- 
ful of lemon juice, and one cup and a 



and let cook in a moderate oven about 
twenty minutes. For twelve filets or 
turbans, prepare a pint of sauce. Use 
one-fourth a cup, each, of butter and 
flour, half a teaspoonful, each, of salt 
and paprika, one cup and a half of fish 
stock, half a cup of thick tomato pur^e, 
a teaspoonful of beef or vegetable 
extract, a tablespoonful of grated horse- 
radish and a tablespoonful of lemon 
juice. Use the cooking liquid of the 
fish as part of the stock. Serve the 
fish around a mound of whole fried 
potatoes and the sauce in a bowl. 



FILETS OF FLOUNDER. CZARINA STYLE, WITH WHOLE FRIED POTATOES 



half of the chopped clams; mix, add 
one egg, beaten light, and let stand 
over boiling water until the egg is 
cooked. Turn on to a buttered dish. 
When cool, shape, cover with beaten 
egg, roll in crumbs and fry in deep fat. 

Filets of Flounder, Czarina Style 
Remove the filets from one or two 
flounders. Trim the filets to the same 
size and shape. Cover all the bones 
and trimmings with cold water; add 
two or three slices, each, of carrot and 
onion, two tablespoonfuls of dried mush- 
rooms and three branches of parsley. 
Let cook half an hour, then strain off 
the broth. Roll the fllets into turban 
shapes, press into each a buttered tooth- 
pick, squeeze over the juice of half a 
lemon and set into a buttered dish; 
pour around a little of the fish stock 



Whole Fried Potatoes 

As the fat bubbles (from the water 
in the potatoes) during the whole time 
of cooking, we might perhaps speak of 
these potatoes as boiled in fat. Have 
the potatoes pared, soaked in cold water 
an hour or more, then dried on a cloth. 
Select rather small potatoes. Let cook 
until they can be pierced with a skewer; 
drain on soft paper at the oven door, 
and serve at once. The potatoes should 
be mealy and without any flavor of 
fat. As many may be cooked at once 
as the frying kettle will conveniently 
hold. 

Sweetbread Rissoles 
Prepare flaky pastry. Use three cups 
of pastry flour, three-fourths a cup of 
any preferred shortening, half a tea- 



SEASONABLE RECIPES 



STRING-BEAN. SALAD, WITH SLICED EGGS 



Spoonful of salt, and cold water as 
needed. Roll into a sheet, then fold 
in one-third a cup of butter. Roll the 
pastry into a sheet and cut into rounds 
about three and a half inches in diame- 
ter. Set a rounding teaspoonful of 
■creamed sweetbread mixture at one 
side of the center ; cut out, nearly, three 
or four small rounds on the other half 
of the paste, brush the edge around the 
mixture with cold water, and fold over 
the other half, pressing the edges 
together; bake about twenty minutes. 
For a cup and one-fourth of sweet- 
breads in cubes, make one cup of 
cream or bechamel sauce. Use three 
tablespoonfuls of flour in place of the 
two commonly used. 

Potato Salad 
Cover a piece of fancy brisket (corned 
beef) with cold water ; let heat gradually 
to the boiling point, then simmer until 



tender. It will take about eight hours. 
Set the meat aside, partly covered, to 
cool. The next day cook some pared 
potatoes and a carrot, nicely scraped, 
in the broth, using separate dishes. 
When these are cold, cut the potatoes 
in half-inch cubes, the carrots in smaller 
cubes. Chop fine in a tray, all together, 
three slices of leek or two of Bermuda 
onions, three branches of parsley, one 
chili pepper or half a green pepper, 
eight stuffed olives and three small 
cucumber pickles or slices of green 
tomato pickle. Add these to three cups 
of potato and half a cup of carrot; 
add also one-third a cup of oil, four 
tablespoonfuls of red wine or real cider 
vinegar and half a teaspoonful of salt. 
Mix together and shape on a serving 
dish in a mound. Spread mayonnaise 
dressing over the mound; set chives, 
cut in bits, and chopped parsley at 
the top of the mound, a wreath of car-

at the base. Surround the whole with 
thin-and-neatly trimmed slices of the 
corned beef. 

Stringbean Salad 
Fresh cooked or canned beans may 
be used. For a pint, chop fine two 
slices of leek or half a thin slice of Ber- 
muda or Spanish onion; add three 
tablespoonfuls of oil, one-fourth a tea- 
spoonful of paprika, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, half a chili pepper, chopped 
fine, and one tablespoonful and a half 
of cider or red-wine vinegar. Mix 
thoroughly and turn on to a plate. 



Macedoine of Vegetables in To-

Cook very gently two cups of canned 
tomatoes, two branches of parsley, a 
branch of celery leaves, one or two table- 
spoonfuls of mushroom trimmings (peel 
and stalks), two slices of onion with 
two cloves, a small bit of bay leaf and 
half a teaspoonful of salt, fifteen min- 
utes; strain, add one-fourth a package 
of gelatine, softened in one-fourth a 
cup of cold water, and a few drops of 
tabasco sauce. Chop line the cooked 
white of one egg. Cut in small bits 
any cooked vegetables at hand, as okra,

and any egg that is left to the tomato, 
which has been cooled somewhat; stir 
until the tomato holds up the vegetables, 
then use to fill the molds. Serve, un- 
molded, on heart -leaves of lettuce, with 
French, mayonnaise or other salad 
dressing. A piece of green pepper or 
a chili pepper may replace the tabasco; 
also mushroom catsup may replace the 
mushroom trimmings, or both may be 
omitt«d. 

Creamed Onions, with Parsley 

Cook the peeled onions in boiling 
water until tender, adding salt when 
about half cooked. For six

in one large or in individual dishes and 
sprinkle generously with fine-chopped

Chestnuts and Bermuda Onions

Select onions of about the same size; 
parboil the onions fifteen minutes, drain 
and set into a buttered casserole. For 
about eight onions, add one cup of 
thick tomato pur4e, a chili pepper, 
with seeds removed, or a green pepper, 
cut in shreds, four branches of parsley, 
about a teaspoonful of salt and boiling

done. It will probably take from half 
to three-fourths an hour to finish the 
cooking. One-fourth a cup, each, of 
butter and flour, creamed together, 
may be stirred with some of the hot 
liquid, then poured into the casserole 
ten minutes before the cooking is com- 
pleted. 

Dinner Rolls 
Mix a cake of compressed yeast with 
one-fourth a cup of scalded -and -cooled 
milk; add to one cup of scalded-and- 
cooled milk with half a teaspoonful of 
salt, a tablespoonful of sugar and about 
one cup and a half of bread flour. 



smooth and elastic. Cover and let 
stand to become light; shape to fit a 
French roll pan. When again light 
bake about twenty-five minutes; brush 
over with beaten white of egg and return 
to the oven a moment to set the glaze. 

Rye Flour-and-Oatmeal Bread 
Pour two cups of milk, scalding hot, 
over one cup of oatmeal; add two table- 
spoonfuls of butter and let stand until 
lukewarm, then add one-fourth a cup 
of molasses, one teaspoonful of salt, 
one-third a cake of compressed yeast 
mixed with half a cup of scalded-and- 
cooled milk, two cups of white bread 
flour and three cups and one half of 
rye-flour. Mix the whole to a smooth 
dough, adding more rye-flour if needed. 
Knead until smooth, using white flour 
on board and hands if required. Let 
stand overnight. In the morning shape 
into two loaves; when again light 
bake one hour. 

Tomato Jelly 
Turn a can of tomatoes into a sie\'e 
and let drain. To this liquid (no pres- 
sure is to be used in seciuing this) 
add the thin yellow rind (cut off with 
a sharp knife), and the juice of a lemon. 
Let boil ten minutes, then add a cup 
of sugar for each cup of juice, measured 
before cooking, and let boil to 220" F.

ripe or water is used in canning, — the 
result is like a thick honey. The addi- 
tion of a few apple parings with the 
lemon peel would, in this latter case, 
produce a firmer jelly. The jelly is 
particularly good with meats. 

Strawberry- J am Tarts 
Make flaky pastry by the recipe given 
so many times in these pages. Roll 
into a sheet and cut into rounds with 
a large cutter. With a pastry tube, 
having a small round opening, cut a 
circle of little rounds, without removing 
the tiny pieces of paste. Set a generous 
spoonful of strawberry jam in the center 
of the plain rounds, disposed in a bak- 
ing pan, and brush the edge with cold 
water; set the other rounds above and 
press the edges firmly upon the edges 
wet with cold water; brush the whole 
with milk or water; dredge with gran- 
ulated sugar. Bake from fifteen to 
twenty minutes. 

Strawberry Short Cake 
Sift together two cups of sifted pas- 
try flour, half a level teaspoonful of 
soda, a slightly rounding teaspoonful 
of cream of tartar and half a teaspoonful 
of salt; with two knives work in one- 
third a cup of shortening, then mix to 
a soft dough with milk. Spread the 
mixture, smooth, in two buttered pans 
about seven and a half inches in dia- 
meter. Bake about twenty minutes. 



Spread the smoothest side of each cake 
generously with butter; put plenty of 
sugared berries on each and set one 
above the other; pipe whipped cream 
above and surround with sugared ber- 
ries. The cake will be at its best, if 
the berries, cut in halves, are mixed 
with sugar half to a full hour before 
serving. 

Oatmeal Cookies 

Beat one cup and a half of butter to 
a cream; gradually beat in two cups of 
granulated sugar, three eggs beaten 
light, two-thirds a cup of milk, four 
cups of oatmeal, four and one-half 
cups of sifted fioiir, sifted again with 
one teaspoonful, each, of soda, salt and 
cinnamon, and one cup, each, of raisins, 
currants and nut meats. Chop the 
raisins and nut meats. Knead and roll 
into a sheet, cut into rounds and bake. 
The recipe will make about seventy 
cakes. 

Hot Fudge Cake in Muffin Pan 
Beat half a cup of butter to a cream; 
gradually beat in one cup of sugar, the 
beaten yolks of two eggs, three ounces 
(or squares) of chocolate, melted over 
hot water, half a cup of molasses, hf^lf 
a cup of sour milk, half a cup of hot 
water, two cups of sifted flour, sifted 
again with one teaspoonful of soda, 
and, lastly, the whites of two eggs, 
beaten dry. Half to a whole teaspoon-

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



ful of cinnamon may be added with the 
soda. Bake in a hot well-buttered 
mufiin pan about half an hour. Serve 
hot as a dessert dish with 

Marshmallow Sauce 

Boil one cup of sugar and half a cup 
of hot water five or six minutes after 
boiling begins. Do not stir after the 
syrup boils. Cover and let boil rapidly 
about three minutes, then uncover. 
Remove from fire; add half a pound of 
marshmallows and beat until they are 
melted. Flavor with vanilla. Serve 
hot. 

Hickory Nut Cake 
Cream two-thirds a cup of butter; 
gradually beat in one cup of sugar, 
one cup of hickory nut meats, chopped, 
the beaten yolks of three eggs, one cup 
of milk, three cups of sifted flour, sifted 
again with two slightly rounding tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, and, lastly, 
the whites of three eggs beaten dry. 
Bake in a well-greased pan (with tube) 
about forty-five minutes. When cold 
cover with confectioner's frosting and 
decorate with boiled frosting. Use a 
plain copper tube for stems, the leaf 



tube for leaves and a small five-pointed 
tin tube for the blossoms. 

Confectioner's Frosting 

Stir sifted confectioner's sugar with 
boiling water to make a frosting that 
will spread without running from the 
cake; more sugar will be needed in the 
frosting for the sides than for the top. 
Flavor with a little grated rind and 
juice of lemon. 

Ornamental Frosting 
Melt one cup of sugar in half a cup 
of boiling water; wash down the sides 
of the saucepan to remove grains of 
sugar; cover and let boil three minutes 
to dissolve the grains of the sugar; 
uncover and let boil, undisturbed, to 
238" F, Pour in a very fine stream on 
the white of an egg, half beaten, beat- 
ing constantly meanwhile. Continue 
the beating until the frosting is cool, 
then beat in a scant teaspoonful of 
lemon juice. Keep the frosting covered 
with a damp cloth (this must not touch 
the frosting) whUe using it. The frost- 
ing for the leaves and stems, shown in 
the illustration, was tinted green and 
the flowers pink with color paste.

Menus for Family of Five 

(One Week) 

Man with gall stones Woman in good health Boy 9 years of age 

Girl 5H y^rs of age One maid 

With gall stones, richly cooked food, meat more than once a day in small 
quantity, sugars and fats are all to be avoided. Sweet vegetables and fruit, 
also yolks of eggs are to be omitted from the dietary. The quantity of food is 
to be cut down and no excess of food taken. Bread, in moderation, well- 
cooked cereals, fresh fish of the white varieties may be eaten; lean beef, lamb 
and chicken, once a day are allowable. Potatoes are thought to be serviceable. 
Many physicians, who consider sugar the only article that must be eliminated, 
give one egg (yolk and white) per day and no fat other than a little butter. 
The Carlsbad dietary for gall stones forbids sugar and butter absolutely, 
but allows a smalj quantity of meat daily. Sir H. Thompson commends oat- 
meal, barley, macaroni, dry lentils in the form of pur6e, rice, tapioca, arrow 
root cooked with weak broth, apples cooked without sugar, celery, lettuce, 
asparagus, kale, tomatoes, potatoes. 

From this you will see that the children must be fed quite differently than the 
man. They need a generous quantity of protein, some sweet, fat and starchy 
foods. 

Children need meat once a day, eggs once a day, plenty of milk, easily digested 
vegetables and fruit. Rice and other puddings in which milk and eggs are 
used, are valuable for children, but should not be eaten by one having gall stones. 
For such, use saccharin for sugar and the whites, only, of the eggs. Children 
shoidd have fresh fruit — carefully selected and fully ripe — - daily. The best 
hotir for this is mid-time between breakfast and dinner. Cooked fruit may be 
eaten with the meals.

THE stewed peaches were cxxiked 
on Thursday. They were cov- 
ered with cold water and, after 
standing two or three hours or overnight, 
were cooked quickly; about one-fourth a 
cjip of sugar was added after the peaches 
were well plumped and tender. One 
pound of peaches was purchased and 
about one-third of them was cooked at 
this time. Sometimes, for a change, 
cook the soaked peaches in the momii^, 
while preparing the breakfast, and 
serve them hot. 

Thtu^day night, before washing the 
supper dishes, pare the potatoes, to 



let them stand overnight in cold water. 

The popovers will need to cook at 
least forty-five minutes, thus the tnixing 
cA these is the first thing to be attended 
to in the morning. Personally we get 
the best results when using ahot iron pan 
having large round cups, but others 
succeed best with the brown earthen 
cups, and still others use tin muSSn pans. 
If an iron pan be used, set it on the 
range or in the oven to heat. For a 
dozen popovers, beat two eggs light, 
without separating the white and yolk — 
uang an egg beater; add two cups of 
milk, and continue to beat while two 
cups of sifted pastry flour and half a 
teaspoonful of ^t are gradually beaten 
into the liquid. Put a scant level 
teaspoonful of butter into each cup and 
poiu- in the mixture. The oven ^ould 
be quite hot, but not of such temperature 
as to brown the top of the popovers 
before they have risen to their full 
height. 

At once set the cereal to cook. If 
it has been cooking over night in the 
fireless cooker, take it out, add boiling 
water, if needed, and set over the fire 
to reheat. Cut the potatoes in halves, 
lengthwise, and these halves in two or 
three pieces, each, and let cook in boil- 
ing salted water until tender; while 
these are cooking set the fish to btoil 
and prepare the maltre d' h6tel butter. 



OUR DAILY BREAD

the coflEec and the toast; directions for 
making- the coffee and the toast were 
given previously. To make the butter, 
beat three tablespoonfuls of butter to 
a cream; gradually beat in one or two 
tablespoonftds of lemon juice and a 
tablespoonful of fine-chopped parsley. 
Do not set the fish into the oven to 
melt the butter, the heat of the fish 
should melt it sufficiently. Butter may 
be spread over the fish, a little lemon 
juice squeezed on and then a sprinkling 
of chopped parsley added ; but the butter 
spreads more easily after creaming 
and the flavor of the lemon juice and 
parsley are brought out better when 
mixed with the butter. 

A scrod is a young, and thus small, 
codfish or haddock, split down the back 
with the backbone wholly or partially 
removed. Scrod is always broiled. The 
fish may be set in a covered dish and kept 
overnight on the lowest shelf of the 
refrigerator. In the morning wipe with 
a damp doth and set into a hot, well- 
greased broiler. Turn occasionally 
while cooking, but cook principally on 
the flesh side; cook the skin side till 
well-colored and crisp; the flesh side 
will not brown as weU. The fish will 
cook in ten or twelve minutes. Set the 
broiler over a plate on a sheet of brown 
paper, press the back of a fotu- pronged 
fork down upon the fish in such a manner 
that two prongs of the fork will be on 
cither side of a wire of the broiler, now 
gently draw the fork down the wire 
the full width of the fish, thus separat- 
ing the flesh from the wire of the broiler; 
repeat this with each wire on one side, 
then turn the broiler and free the fish 
from the wires, in the same manner, on 
the other side, then slide the fish, skin 
side down, upon a hot platter. Spread 
the fish with the butter and take at 
once to the table. Drain the potatoes, 
sprinkle with salt, which will draw out 
more of the water and tend to make 
the potatoes mealy. Serve the toast 
in a rack that each slice may retain 
its crispness. Later on, serve the peaches 



and popovers — taking out the fish 
dishes on the way to the range. 

After breakfast is cleared away, mix 
the bread and make the plain pastry, 
given on page 502 of the November 
ntmiber; the ingredients for the paste 
were: three cups of sifted pastry flour, 
six ounces (three-fourths a cup) of 
shortening, half a teaspoonftil, each, of 
salt and baking powder and nearly 
three-fourths a cup of water. This will 
make two large pies, one with two and 
the other with one crust, and possibly 
one or two tarts. Take one-third of the 
paste, and roll it into a rectangular 
sheet ; on one half set little dots of butter, 
and fold paste over the butter, on half 
of this surface; set dots of butter and 
fold the other half of the paste over 
the butter (use three or four table- 
spoonfuls of butter) ; pat the paste with 
the rolling pin, then roll into a sheet and 
use as the upper crust of the pie. For 
the filling pour boiling water over three 
cups and one half of sliced rhubarb, 
let stand a moment, then drain. Beat 
two eggs; add two cups of sugar, three 
tablespoonfuls of flour and three-fotu'ths 
a teaspoonful of salt, mixed together, and 
turn into the plate lined with plain 
paste; add two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
here and there in little bits, a grating 
of lemon or orange rind or of nutmeg, 
brush the edge with cold water and set 
the upper crust in place; bake about 
half an hotu*. 

The pastry can be begun while the 
milk is scalding for the bread, but, give 
the mixing of the bread precedence, 
that the bread may be baked as early as 
possible. If preferred, mix the bread 
Thursday night, using one-third of a 
cake of yeast; "cut down" the bread 
the first thing in the morning, then 
shape into loaves at the first opportune 
moment thereafter. To mix in the 
morning, pour two cups of scalded milk 
into the mixing bowl over one cup of 
dry oatmeal; add one-fourth a cup of 
molasses or sugar, two tablespoonfuls 
of shortening and half a teaspoonful 



•• .

THE BOSTON COOKING-vSCHOOL MAGAZINE 



of salt; when the liquid is lukewarm, 
add a cake of compressed yeast, broken 
into and mixed with half a cup of luke- 
warm milk or water; mix thoroughly, 
then stir in two cups of sifted bread 
flour and three cups and a half of sifted 
rye flour. A little more rye flour may 
be needed. Knead the dough until 
smooth and elastic. Use white flour 
on the board in kneading. Set the dough 
aside until doubled in bulk, then shape 
for two bread pans. When again light 
bake about one hour. The first rising 
will take about four hours, the last 
•about one hour. This bread tastes 
good and is most wholesome. 

If the pie be not baked when the early 
morning work in the kitchen is finished, 
pare the potatoes for dinner, and cover 
them with cold water; cut the stalks of 
asparagus to the same length and tie 
them in two bunches; wash the cress 
and wrap in a cloth; set the root end of 
the endive in a bowl of cold water, and 
dispose this and the cress in the refriger- 
ator; make the French dressing, then, if 
the oven is available, make the sponge 
cake for supper. The ordinary sponge 
Cake is apt to be tough and dry; sponge 
cake made of potato flour is tender, 
delicate and light as down. A ^'spring 
form" pan is of advantage in cooling 
the cake, but any new, ungreascd. pan 
may be UwSed successfully, if in cooling 
the cake the ends of the pan be propped 
up to leave the cake suspended from 
the bottom of the tin. Cooled in this 
way, the cells that make up the cake 
are not compressed in the least, but 
rather elongated and the cake is par- 
ticularly light. For the cake take the 
grated rind and juice of half a lemon, 
five fresh eggs, one cup of granulated 
sugar and half a cup' of i)otato' flour. 
Beat th« yolks until very light-colored 
and thick, and the whites, until dry; 
gradually beat the sugar into the yolks; 
add the rind, grated, and juice and the 
flour; cut and fold, (or turn the mixture 
over and over with a slittcd spoon), 
until the ingredients are blended, then 



cut and fold in the egg-whites. 

In mixing a • true sponge cake, a 
stirring motion is not used; the air beaten 
into the eggs, which makes for lightness, 
would be lost, if the mixture be -stirred. 
This point* is essential to the, success 
' of a true sponge cake. Break down the 
bubbles and the cake will be tough and 
heavy; for in a true sponge cake baking 
'powder or cream of tartar and soda 
have no place. The cake should bake 
about fifty minutes; when baked- it 
should be a light golden brown. - In the 
ordinary spring-form sponge-cake pan 
the mixture should- rise to within . an 
inch of the top of the pan. The oven 
must be very moderate, but amenable 
to increase of heat at -the- last. • In- ser\'- 
ing do" not ciit, but tear apart with two

' V An hour before dinner the oveii must 
be hot "for the meat; This is the filet 
from under ' the rump, and it- weighs 
about three pounds. - It- is a piece of 
solid, tender meat, without waste^ -but 
lacking in flavor. To add to its flavor, 
mushroom .' sauce is served with it ; 
tomato sauce may be used in place of 
the sauce given. Rub over the meat 
w^th salt and flour, set slices of fat 
salt pork or bacon above the meat, and 
baste with the fat in the pan every ten 
minutes. After the meat has been 
cooking twenty minutes, cook the pota- 
toes in boiling, sal ted water ten or fifteen 
minutes, then drain and set them on the 
rack around the meat ; baste the potatoes 
with the dripping each time the meat 
is basted. Set the asparagus to cook, 
upright, in a tall saucepan — part 
of a double-boiler is a suitable dish — 
Use boiling, salted water; the tips need 
not be covered with water; cover the 
dish and the tips will be cooked in the 
steam. • 

For the Holljandaise sauce, cream 
one-third a cup of butter; beat in three 
egg-yolks, one at a time; add one-fourth 
a teaspoonful,- each, of salt and black 
pepper, and the juice of half a -lemon,

that you may finish the sauce after 
the rest of the dinner is on the table. 

When the meat and potatoes are done, 
remove to the serving dishes and set 
into the warming oven. 

Pour off all the fat, then turn into 
the pan about a cup and a half of beef 
broth or water and liquid from the can 
of mushrooms as is convenient. Return 
the pan to the fire and let the liquid 
simmer imtil the browned meat-juices 
are taken up by the liquid. Put three 
tablespoonfuls of the fat or dripping 
into a small saucepan; when hot, add 
three tablespoonfuls of ordinary flour 
or twice the quantity of browned flour 
(flour cooked and stirred in the oven 
imtil brown throughout) and one-fourth 
a teaspoonful of salt; stir and cook 
until frothy, then add the liquid from 
the pan, cooled a little, and stir until 
boiling. More salt may be needed. 
Add the mushrooms, whole or cut in 
halves, lengthwise, and let stand to 
become hot without boiling. See that 
bread, butter, water and the salad are 
on the table. Pour the mushroom sauce 
into a hot bowl or sauce boat. Set 
the dish of creamed butter and egg- 
yolks over boiling water; add half a 
cup of the asparagus water and stir 
constantly until the mixture thickens; 
add the lemon juice, mix, set the aspar- 
agus on two slices of toast, tips towards 
each other; pour over the sauce and 



take all the dishes to the table. 

About an hour before supper,put over 
the fire, in a double boiler, half a cup 
of sifted, soft bread crumbs, a peeled 
onion into which six cloves have been 
pushed, and one pint of milk; let cook 
about an hour; remove the onion and 
cloves, add half a teaspoonful of salt, 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of paprika and 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and beat 
thoroughly. When the timbales are 
unmolded, turn the sauce arotmd them 
and press a sprig of parsley into the 
top of each timbale. 

For the timbales beat six eggs without 
separating the whites and yolks, add a 
scant teaspoonful of salt, a dash of 
pepper, a teaspoonful of fine-chopped 
parsley, twenty drops of onion juice 
and one cup and a half of rich milk, 
Stir until well mixed and turn into 
well-buttered timbale molds. Set the 
molds on many folds of paper in a bak- 
ing pan, and pour in boiling water to 
half the height of the molds. Let bake 
in a moderate oven until the mixture 
is firm in the center. The water should 
not boil during the cooking. About 
twenty minute of cooking will be needed. 
Remove the cups from the water and 
let stand to contract two or three 
minutes before unmolding. While the 
timbales and sauce are cooking the 
strawberries may be hulled and the 
table made ready.

German Home and Kitchen Proverbs 

By Kate Hudson 



UNTIL very recently the German 
wife and mother has been con- 
spicuously absent from the 
ranks of her "New Woman** sisters; 
for, though there may have been an 
occasional *' Emancipated One,** as 
the Nineteenth Century used to call 
her, the majority of home-makers con- 
fined their attentions to the Kaiser's 
"Church, Kitchen and Nursery.*' In 
the first of these departments woman 
took a very back seat — or, should we 
say, pew! — but in the other two she 
reigned supreme, and right royally 
laid down the law. That the women 
also largely made the saws and sayings 
of the Fatherland, the following German 
proverbs may testify. 

The thrifty German house-wife is 
saving from choice, quite as much as 
from necessity; she always — it*s bom 
in her — "Stretches herself according 
to her bed-clothes; so that her feet 
may not come uncovered.'* And, by 
way of proving that "A penny saved 
is one twice-earned,'' and that the 
"dollar is the dollar's son,** she not 
only carefully attends to what comes 
in and goes out of her kitchen, but also 
does most of her own sewing. "Home- 
spun, home-made, and clean are the 
handsomest gowns*' says she, and com- 
forts herself, when less fashionably 
dressed than American Edna or French 
Celestine, by any one of the following 
pertinent dictums: "There are those 
who*d wear a cow's-tail, were it the 
fashion;" or "Stupidity and Vanity 
grow on the same bush;" or "Silk and 
velvets put out the kitchen fire." 

She meets the various fortunes of her 
work-a-day with all sorts of suitable 
sayings. She wotdd, probably, prefer 
to go visiting, but remembers that 
"The wife and the cat belong at home," 
and, while hoping that something or 



someone may turn up to break the 
monotony, recalls that "Much may 
happen between Twelve and dinner- 
time!" The crash of perfectly good 
china will be met with "Alas! how 
soon do luck and crockery go to smash !" 
and the little n\irse -maid's complaint 
that the washerwoman is cross and 
goes about looking "as if her parsley 
had been spoiled by the hail," or as if 
"the chickens had run off with her 
bread," with the request to be sure and 
stroke "Minna's fur the right way," 
because, as everyone well knows, Minna 
has got to "be handled like a raw egg." 
When, along about three o'clock, a 
friend drops in "for coffee," the two 
ladies chat away in most picturesque, 
proverb - decorated language. The 
announcement of someone's engage- 
ment gives rise to "Love and good 
judgment never did and never will 
walk hand in hand;" the tolerant 
"Every saucepan sooner or later finds 
its lid;" or the more acrid "Crooked 
saucepan, crooked lid." A contradicted 
report brings "Lies have short legs and 
can't run far," the exceedingly true 
''maybe'' is half a lie," and "The tongue 
has no bones, but gives many a hard 
knock." Incompetent Frau Schmieder 
is described as "eating cake to save 
bread,** and as "himting for a lost 
penny with a three-penny candle;" 
both ladies will then sigh yes, yes, 
"Money is a good slave but a bad 
master," and will discuss Herr Schma- 
lix, who has amassed a fortune in 
six short years, despite the fact that 
"Luck comes a-limping and goes a- 
nmning." One lady will sagely remark 
"Gold shows no stains and rusts not," 
and the other will regret that "Some 
have the money and others but the 
purse."

Foot Ease for the Housewife 

ONE of the first requisites for the 
hoiisewife's comfort is to be pro- 
perly shod. The house shoe is, pre- 
ferably, of soft pliable kid or canvas 
with low broad heels capped with 
rubber. A fairly heavy sole insures 
the greatest ease for those who are 
compelled to stand much. Great care 
shoidd be exercised in the fit, as shoes 
that are either too large or too small 
inevitably produce corns. 

If these should appear, much relief 
can be obtained by rubbing with 
pumice stone, 

A com remedy which our foremothers 
swore by was a poultice made of bread 
crumbs that had been soaked in cider 
vinegar for half an hour or longer. 
This was bound on the affected toe 
over night; after which the com was 
easily dislodged. This is in line with 
the treatment that prescribed the bind- 
ing on of salt pork rind for a sore 
or stubbed toe, and I have heard more 
than one old Yankee Graybeard testify 
to it's efflcacy. 

There is nothing much more disas- 
trous for the foot's well-being than 
wearing a boot that is too short, for 
enlarged joints or bunions are the 
painful result. Some relief is afforded 
such a condition by wearing bunion 
plasters, which help lessen the pressure. 
Where there is much inflammation 
surrounding the joint, an occasional 
painting with tincture of iodine will 
alleviate the suffering. 



People whose feet have a tendency 
to perspire excessively should use borax 
in the footbath and then dust the feet 
thoroughly with lycopodium. 

Mr. Weston, the champion walker, 
after a long sprint, always bathes his 
feet in warm water in which a generous 
amount of sea-salt has been dissolved. 
On removal from this bath, he rubs his 
feet enthusiastically for some moments 
with a rough, coarse towel. For tired, 
aching feet there is no better treatment. 
Swollen feet are sometimes benefited 
by bathing in water in which wood- 
ashes have been boiled. It is under- 
stood that the water is strained before 
using. 

Some women cannot take a ramble 
of any length without incurring blistered 
feet. This can be obviated, at the out- 
set, by rubbing the soles of the stockings 
worn with pure castile soap, and by 
softening the soap with water and 
applying to the sides and bottom of 
the feet. 

In summer, when the feet seem to 
tire most easily, a satisfying sense of 
refreshment follows a dusting with 
talcum powder, slipping on fresh hosiery 
and a change of shoes. 

Not only the shoes but the surface 
on which one stands has much to do 
with foot-fatigue. The favorite foot- 
rug for those who are obliged to stand 
a great deal is the fibre matting made 
from "Coir", the outer husk of the 
cocoanut. It "gives" most agreeably 
to the tread. Rugs of this material, 
placed in front of the stove, table

sink, or wherever the housewife must 
stand for long periods, will contribute 
mudi toward foot comfort. 

In cold weather, chilblains are often 
the housekeeper's bane. Tincture of 
myrrh diluted with warm water is 
very healing; while bathing night and 
, morning with witch hazel is also bene- 
ficial. An old-time remedy much" 
favored by our grandsires was a poul- 
tice of roasted turnip and one that 
often proved effectual in the most 
stubborn cases. 

It is the height of folly for the domes- 
tic woman to slight either care or 
shoeing of her "trilbies", for, day in 
and day out, ill-treated feet retaliate 
by handicapping a good deal of worth- 
while efficiency. e. r. w.

Table Center Piece 

AVERY pleasing centerpiece for 
the dinner table is a small 
fern dish or brass jardiniere in which 
the seed of the grape fruit has been 
freely planted and given six or eight 
weeks to get well started. 

The glossiness and freshness of the 
foliage is beautiful and the effect 
on the table excellent. 

A Garden Symphony in Yellow 

MORE and more are we working 
out distinct color schemes in 
house furnishing, wearing apparel, and 
now in gardening. 

No color is more noticeable in nature 
and none more important or practical 
than yellow. 

A long, irregular shaped border in 
varying shades of yellow affords a 
vast amount of beauty and enjoyment, 
not only to those who plant and own 
it, but to all passers-by. 

By beginning in a modest way and 
raising one's own plants from seed, 
this need not be at all expensive. 

One might almost start in as did 
the woman who has what she calls 
her friendship garden^ her different 



friends giving her a plant, a few btilbs 
or seed of their own raising. This 
particular garden is an old-fashioned 
one and most attractive. 

A number of wild flower roots can 
be taken up and transplanted with 
good results, such as brown-eyed 
Susans and golden rod. This border 
should contain marguerites, coreopsis, 
both annual and perennial, in all the 
yellow hues, marigold, zinnias, hel- 
iopsis, dahlias, calliopsis, gladioli, 
snap-dragons, cannas, golden glow, 
and sun flowers. 

For low bedding plants, use old- 
fashioned portulaca, CaUfomia poppies, 
pansies, daisies, nasttutiums and the 
annual coreopsis. 

The double, yellow hollyhocks make 
a pretty, striking back ground as 
does the golden glow when used in 
large clumps. 

Lemon lilies are beautiful and 
fragrant. 

One is greatly surprised, after giving 
attention and study to this color 
scheme, to find what an astonishingly 
large number of yellow flowers there 



are.

A Little Knowledge is a Dangerous 

Thing 

* * /^^ OME , go home with me" , said Julia 
V_> Hill one night after school, 
some time after I had matriculated at 
the temple of learning in the little 
town to which our family had recently 
moved. As I was a green little city 
girl, who had been made to feel my 
abysmal ignorance of the essential 
features of country life, I felt highly 
honored by this unexpected attention 
from the tall girl who seemed so wonder- 
fully capable. 

Needless to say, I accepted the 
invitation with joy, with the necessary, 
tho* hateful proviso, if my mother 
would let me. Julia looked down upon 
me from her superior height and 
gave me the impression t!hat she did 



r 



HOME IDEAS AND ECONOMIES 



787 



not have to ask her mother for such 
privileges, but did only as she herself 
pleased. 

However, the desired permission was 
readily given, as my mother, in com- 
mon with most city-bred people, had 
a vague idea that a farm is the safest 
of places for children, and the Hills 
lived on a farm on the edge of the town. 

We were soon on our way and Julia 
amused herself and amazed me by 
exhibiting various feats of strength 
and skill, such as vaulting fences, 
pulling herself up into trees, and jump- 
ing over a little brook that meandered 
across the road. If her object was 
to arouse my envy, she was wholly 
successful, for it was my passionate 
desire to do all the things denied to 
me by reason of my small siz^ and 
puny strength. To be tall and strong 
was the height of my ambition, and 
I think Julia must have divined it, 
for she ** showed off" with all the superb 
self-satisfaction of a twelve year old 
girl who is taller and stronger than 
any of her school mates. 

On the way she confided to me her 
special reason for such condescension. 
Her mother was away for the evening, 
and she must get the supper and do 
the other work. **And", said she, 
**I must make biscuit, if there is not 
enough bread." 

Town-bred as I was, the natural 
thing to do under such circumstances 
would have been to send to the bake- 
shop, and I said so, only to be withered 
by the scorn with which she repudiated 
the idea of having * 'baker's bread". 
And again I felt the sickening sense 
of inferiority that always oppressed 
me in the company of girls who were 
skilled in housewifely arts. 

Noticing my evident discomfiture, 
Julia proceeded to dilate upon her 
various accomplishments in the culi- 
nary line, beside which my ability to 
lead my class in mere book studies 
was as nothing. 

The farm-house was large and roomy, 



and full of interest to me, because her 
father had been a sea-faring man, 
and had a collection of curios, common 
enough to dwellers by the sea, but 
strange and new to one who had seen 
no greater body of water than Lake 
Michigan. Jtdia's exhibition of these, 
with a natural pride in their ownership, 
by proxy, completed my subjugation, 
and I was in a very fit condition of 
humility, when she announced that 
it was time to begin getting supper, 
and we repaired to the kitchen. 

To build the kitchen fire with wood 
was not a difficult task and Julia was 
soon ready to make the biscuits. 
Whereat a difficulty arose in the way, 
— there was no baking powder. Con- 
sternation! 

Then my natural pride asserted 
itself and I remarked, with the confidence 
bom of the re-action from unusual 
humility, no more my natural state 
than Julia's, "But you can use soda 
and cream of tartar in place of baking 
powder. Mother often does." 

**But I don't know how," said Julia. 
Ah, ha! Here was my opportunity. 
I knew. Had I not twice made a 
feather cake with entire success, using 
the aforesaid combination to lighten 
the same? And had I not been told 
the proportion in which the ingredients 
were mingled? 

Alas, for the fallibility of human 
knowledge! "For each teaspoonful of 
baking powder," said I dogmatically, 
"use two spoonfuls of saleratus and 
one of cream tartar." This, then, 
we did, substituting for the foiu* her 
recipe called for, eight spoonfuls of 
soda and five of the other, for good 
measure. 

Soon the biscuits were made and 
in the oven, which was already in 
prime condition, and Julia was attend- 
ing to the other details of the meal. 
In due time she opened the oven door 
to look at the biscuit. Ugh! the odor 
from them smote the air with over- 
powering force, and we could see in 



788 



THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL MAGAZINE 



the oven some horrible looking, greenish- 
yellow objects no more attractive to 
sight than to smell. 

Julia took one out to sample it. 
The taste was worse than either looks 
or odor. Something dreadful had come 
from that combination! 

Julia, creature of resources and mind- 
ful of some teasing big brothers, who 
would * 'plague the life out of us," 
decided that the biscuit must be put 
out of sight. The pigs should eat 
them! So we took them to the stye 
and offered them as a sacrifice to 
those animals. Alas, they only sniffed 
and turned away from them. Thus 
I learned that there are limits even to 
a pig's appetite. 

"Well," said Julia, "we will bury 
them." And so we did, choosing a 
comer of the pig-pen for such sepulture. 
Then we went into the house and, on 
closer investigation, found there was 
bread enough for supper, if we restrained 
our own appetites, so the disaster did 
not seem quite so overpowering. 

The meal passed off very well and 
Captain Hill praised his little cook 
in a way that would have seemed 
very fine, but for the hidden memory 
of those biscuit. 

Alas, it was only the memory that 
was hidden, for after supper Lorenzo 
and Alonzo, huge scions of the house, 
went out to do the chores, while Julia 
and I did the dishes. Presently with 
a great guffaw the boys burst into 
the kitchen. The pigs had up-rooted 
the biscuit and the boys had discovered 
them. 

This is a good place to close the story. 
I would fain draw a veil over the humil- 
iation that followed, and forget how 
I ever after would turn a corner and 
nm as fast as I could to escape, when- 
ever I saw Alonzo or Lorenzo in the 
village. Julia magnanimously laid all 
the blame upon me, and, in my heart 
of hearts, I knew that I was only 
properly punished for assuming to 
know that which I did not. But to 



this day I never hear the phrase "soda 
biscuit" that my face does not flush 
with the memory of my first biscuit, 
when I learned that a little knowledge 
is a dangerous thing. w. h. h. t.

An Explorer's Diet 

WHEN Arch Deacon Hudson 
Stuck climbed Mt. McKinley 
in Alaska, he planned a more successful 
diet than the former explorers of that 
great peak had tried; they failed 
because they had canned food. 

The writer was informed by him 
that, since it was a fine game country 
around the mountain, the party shot 
caribou and mountain sheep and made 
a variety of pemmican of it. He 
boiled the meat thoroughly and minced 
it fine. This he made with butter into 
balls and froze them hard. The broth 
was reduced to the thickest possible 
meat jelly or "stock". A favorite 
and satisfying meal that did not doy 
the appetite was some of thispemmican, 
heated, and rice, some German pea- 
meal sausage, and about two table- 
spoonfuls of the meat broth made into 
bouillon to drink. 

For the very high altitudes, they kept 
tea, almonds, chocolate, etc., etc. 

In Switzerland the guides eat choco- 
late and lump sugar, since these can 
be readily carried in difficult places 
where every ounce counts. 

Some Pensylvania Recipes 
Pineapple and Cherries 

A very nice preserve made up in 
Montgomery County is of morello 
sour cherries with pineapple. The 
appearance is of cherry preserve, but 
the more delicious flavor betokens at 
once what has been added. Cut the 
pineapple very fine. Allow one to 
about five|orsix quarts of seeded cherries, 
according to the size and flavor of the 
pineapple. 

A good morello cherry preserve is 
nice by itself, but when the variety is 



HOME IDEAS AND ECONOMIES 



789 



not as fine as it might be, but still 
too good a crop not to be utilized, 
this addition of pineapple will be very 
welcome. Of course the fresh pine- 
apple, full of flavor, is best but, if not 
available, use some of the canned or 
preserved pineapple readily obtained 
of any grocer. 

Canned Fidd Mushrooms 

The fields belonging to the family, 
giving these recipes, are white with 
fine mushrooms, for weeks every stun- 
mer, and so many are gathered for 
stews, and broils, and fritters, that 
the family are weary of them. The 
Italian laborers are sated, and only 
the ravenous automobilists, at the 
Inn in ever-varying numbers, never 
get enough. 

And yet, in winter, these mushrooms 
give an agreeable change, added to 
various dishes and gravies, or soaked 
and stewed; for the custom from year 
to year has been to dry them. Canning 
had not proved a success until the 
following was tried; that is, to stew 
them until thoroughly sterilized and 
add a tablespoonful of vinegar to a 
fair-sized saucepan or kettle. Also two 
cloves were added, since these would 
be suitable in any soup or made dish. 

Pickled Mushrooms 

For pickled mushrooms only the 
tiniest and firmest buttons are chosen. 
These are boiled in diluted vinegar for 
ten minutes. One third water being 
used for strong vinegar. Celery and 
a little spice are added, and they are 
sealed in pint glass jars. 

To Save on the Gas Bill; Burn 
Newspapers 

IN siunmer many houses are arranged 
to dispense with the coal range 
and cook by a gas range and heat the 
bath-boiler by another gas heater. 
Whatever the way may be, whether a 
gas cooker or simple hot plate, etc., 
to heat dishwater costs money. It is 



therefore a money saving plan to lessen 
the gas bill by heating the dishwater, 
or even kettles for washing out light 
things, as well as dishtowels, by making 
a fire in the range of newspapers. 
Refill once and such a fire will answer 
well. Of course any bits of fat not to be 
rendered, greasy papers, and scraps 
of wooden boxes, berry boxes, etc., can 
go in to add zest to it and get these out 
of the way. 

Even managers of large rooming and 
apartment houses do this to save the 
gas bill during the slack months of 
summer in town, and to have a fire 
that dies down, at once, when the water 
is heated. j. d. c. 



Bran Bread 
Useful as a Steam Pudding Also 



2 cups bran flour 
1 cup white flour 
1 tea spoon soda 
1-4 teaspoon fine salt 



3-4 cup raisins 

3 tablespoons molasses 

1 cup milk 

1-4 cup water 



If soiu" milk or cream is used, add one 
teaspoon soda. Steam three hours in a 
one and one-half quart mould. Being 
rather heavy to digest in addition to 
a hearty meal, the writer finds it con- 
venient to use it as the main article 
for limcheon. She is alone at noon and 
the recipe makes sufiicient for six or 
seven meals. Keeps moist a week, 
and is palatable without butter. Us- 
ing a fireless cooker to steam it, and 
then only once a week, it is a saving 
in labor as to preparation of luncheons. 

It makes a good steam pudding, if 
one-fourth cup of chopped nuts and three 
figs, cut in small pieces, are added; 
serve with 

Creamy Sauce 



1-4 cup butter 

1-2 cup powdered sugar 



2 tablespoons milk or 

cream 
2 tablespoons water 
1-2 teaspoon vanilla 

Cream the butter, add sugar grad- 
ually, then milk and water, a little 
at a time, and cook over hot water.

should blend the ingredients, s. b. p.

Canned Salmon Salad 

Drain the salmon, separate into large 
flakes and set these on a bed of heart- 
leaves of lettuce. Mix one teaspoonful 
of scraped onion, six tablespoonfuls of 
oil, three tablespoonfuls of red wine or 
cider vinegar, half a teaspoonful, each, 
of salt and paprika and pour over the 
whole. Serve at once. 

Hot Canned Salmon 

Set the unopened can of salmon into 
a saucepan of boiling water and let 
boil ten or fifteen minutes; open the 
can at the edge and all arotind the top, 
that the salmon may be removed un- 
broken. Drain off all the liquid possible. 
Turn the fish on to a folded napkin on 
a hot platter. Garnish witk a slice of 
lemon or hard-cooked egg and parsley. 
Serve with egg or pickle sauce (drawn 
butter).

mixture coats the spoon. Remove from 
the fire and add one-fourth a package 
of gelatine, softened in one-fourth a 
cup of cold water or chicken broth. 
Strain the preparation over half a cup 
of cooked, chicken breast, chopped, 
poimded in a mortar and sifted. Stir 
over ice water, until the mixture begins 
to set, then fold into it one cup of whip- 
ped cream. Turn into small timbaJe 
molds, or into a large mold lined with 
paper. The molds may be decorated 
with pistachio nuts or truffles, or both 
may be used. Serve when chilled and 
firm with lettuce or other green salad. 
This is particularly good with lettuce 
and tomatoes. French or mayonnaise 
dressing may be used. 

To decorate the molds, rince them in 
chicken aspic or butter them slightly.

Exit the Cow 



THE latest touch in the romance of 
the "soya bean comes with the dis- 
covery that it may be used in the 
large-scale production of artificial milk. 
Since 1906, the year of its first impor- 
tation into Europe from China, Japan, 
Korea and Manchuria, the utilization 
of this famous Asiatic growth has 
advanced by leaps and bounds. The 
beans go in the making of oil and the 
manufacture of soap, with their waste 
returned to the soil as fertilizers. Cattle 
cakes are prepared from them for winter 
feeding. Soya meal is in large demand ; 
soya sauces and relishes are already 
widdy known. From the same legumi-- 
nous plant come vermicelli, biscuits 
and other food products. To-day the 
West receives something I'ke a mil- 
lion tons of the beans each year; for 
England alone the frieght on them 
amotmts to $5,000,000 annually. 




A Chinaman was the first to experi- 
ment with soya in the preparation 
of a substitute for milk, but the dis- 
agreeable taste of the liquid that came 
from his primitive laboratory made it 
unpalatable for Occidentals. A German 
expert then took up the enterprise, 
and English chemists now c'aim to have 
carried it to complete success. The 
new milk is built up from a basis of 
casein obta'ned from the soya bean. 
The beans are treated by a special 
process whereby all oil and waste matter 
are removed, leaving only the pure 
casein. To this basis are added, in 
exact proportions, fatty ac ds, sugars 
and salts. Then, in order that the 
synthetic milk may approximate in all 
resepcts to real milk, bacteria of the 
required strains, including lactic add 
bacilli, are introduced into the fluid 
and allowed to act on it until "maturity" 
is reached. Complete emulsification is 
secured by the process. 

This artificial product is now to be 
put on the market as a "pure and 
wholesome milk of high nutritive value** 
— **a real milk from which cheese and 
butter can be made** — **a milk/* more- 
over, "that can be produced more 
cheaply than the article obtained from 
the cow.*' People who have tasted it 
call the fluid "quite indistinguishable 
from the milk now in use,** and "delight- 
fully smooth on the palate.** By var\'- 
ing the proportion of casein, fat, sugar 
or salts, it can be adapted at need to chil- 
dren or invalids, according to medical 
prescription. Everything else said of 
it being true, the soya product has one 
crowning recommendation. It solves 
the "clean milk** problem, and is ab- 
solutely free from the "milk-borne*' 
diseases that now harrass the dairyman, 
the legislator and the consumer.

Polly's Course in Designing 

(Continued from P^e 765) 

the shops allowed Polly to exhibit some 
sample baskets. No artist ever worked 
harder over a masterpiece than did 
Polly over those sample baskets. Indeed, 
they were masterpieces when they 
were arranged. There were apples, 
polished to the last degree of shine, 
plums, pears and luscious grapes. Little 
pie-pumpkins, squashes, immaculate 
beets and carrots, celery, cabbage, 
cauliflower and lettuce filled other 
baskets. Everything which the farm 
produced was represented. Polly's 
brothers grew almost as enthu^astic 
as she and selected for her the most 
perfect specimens of their kind. The 
younger children helped Polly weave 
some of the smaller baskets. These 
were filled with nuts and some of the 
smaller fruits. Little jars of preserves 
and jellies, which PoUy had carefully 
made under the mother's supervision, 
found their way into some of the 
baskets. 

Polly's baskets charmed the city 
customers. She had to work early and 
late to fill the orders that came pouring 
in for the Thanksgiving and Christmas 
trade. Even her father grew interested 
in spite of himself. Never before had 
the produce of the MacDougall farm 
brought such prices as when manipu- 
lated by Polly's artistic fingers. Even 
doughnuts, made by Mrs. MacDougall's 
choice recipe, cookies and little home- 
made cakes were pressed into service 
to fill some of the baskets. 

It was a wealthy Polly who sat down 
to figure up her gains. She said to 
her father, "If I pay you what the 
fruits and vegetables would have 
brought, had you sold by the old method, 
then I will have earned all the rest by 
myself, won't I?" Mr. MacDougall 
looked down at her proudly, "Keep 
it all, little girl," he said, "and use 
it for that course in Designing at the 
Institute. You have shown me that

German Home and ICitchrn 
Proverbs 

(Continued from P^e 784) 



The sad case of Frau MuUer, forced 
in her old age to enter a Home, shows 
how true it is that "One mother can 
better care for ten children than ten 
children for one mother;" and careless 
Onkel Franz, badly cheated by a much 
too clever brother-in-law, shows that 
you must, "If your best friend is a 
fox, keep an eye on your chickens." 

Whatever the topic, whatever its 
lesson, there's a proverb to fit it: 

"Roasted chickens lay no eggs." 

"The day breaks even though the 
cock crow not." 

"Pills must be swallowed, not chewed." 

"Even a blind hen will sometimes 
find a grain of com." 

"First, I and mine; then, thou and 
thine." 

"Never crawl where you might soar." 

"A full stomach hates to study." 

"Adam's children are just like Adam." 
and the sardonic: 

"Adam just had to have an Eve on 
whom to blame his own misdoings." 

A bashful swain hovers around a 
girl like "the cat round the hot mush:" 
and a favorite dish, a crowd, or the 
housekeeping money, as they rapidl>' 
disappear, "melt away like butter in 
the sun." An unexpected happening, 
an incredible story, will make the 
German housekeeper say, "Well, ueW. 
Will some one please fry me a couple 
of storks!" and a sad tale of worn, 
anxiety, or anticipated hard, bad luck, 
will bring from her the consoling "So 
broth is ever eaten as hot as it is ladled 
out in the kitchen." And one of the 
truest words ever spoken shall 'round 
up this little collection:' 

"Eggs and 'ihey-says' are brittle; 

beware! 

For an egg, once broken; and a 'the;- 

say' once spoken. 

Will never, no never, become whole b\' 

repair!"

The Way to Distinguish an 
Imperfect Can 

WHEN the housewife is dissatisfied 
with Canned Foods, it is ahnost 
always because of an imperfect can -or 
difficulty in opening it. 

Occasionally, in making a can, the 
seam is not closed perfectly tight, or it 
is injured by rough handling in shipping, 
and air gradually leaks into the can 
through some very small opening that 
cannot be easily discovered. This causes 
the tin to bulge out slightly at the ends 
and the contents to deteriorate. 

Before opening a tin of Canned Foods 
of any kind, whether they be prepared 
at home or not, always examine the top 
and bottom. If the tin is convex or 
buldged out, it is best to return it to 
the dealer. Probably it is overfilled, or 
not cooked enough, but it might be 
an imperfect can, and it is best not to 
accept it. 

If the can is sound and the ends flat, 
or slightly drawn in, you can be sure that 
the contents are in perfect conditions. 

To open the can, remove enough of 
the label so as to see the seam on the 
side of the can; lay the can on its side 
and insert the opener right next to 
this seam and close to the top. Now 
hold the can firmly on the table in an 
upright position and work the opener 
away from the seam until you have cui 
entirely around the can. You can then 
turn back the entire top and the fruii 
will not be mutilated when it is poured. 
If the can is held firmly, there is no 
danger of cutting the hands. 



A Revised Version 
One predicts a future for the school- 
boy who wrote the following terse 
narrative about Elijah: 

"There was a man named Elijah. 
He had some bears and he lived in a 
cave. Some boys tormented him. He 
said: 'If you keep on throvring stones 
at me, I'll turn the bears on you and 
they'll eat you up.' And they diu 
and he did and the bears did."

In Answer to Praya 

THE author of "Seventy Years 
Young," Mrs. Emily P. Bishop, 
tells of one way, and a very good way, 
indeed, of insuring an answer to our 
prayers. 

A little girl's brother set a trap to 
catch birds. The little girl knew that 
it was wrong, cruel, against the laws of 
kindness, and altogether inexcusable. 
She wept at first, then her mother 
noticed that she became cheerful again, 
and she was asked the cause. 

"I prayed for my brother to be a 
better boy." 

"What else?" inquired her mother. 

"I prayed that the trap would not 
catch any little birds." 

"What else?" 

"Then I went out and kicked the old 
trap all to pieces." 



Another Higher Critic 

A SUNDAY school teacher told 
about in "Everybody's", after 
conducting a lesson on the story of 
"Jacob's Ladder," concluded by saying: 
"Now is there any little girl or boy who 
would like to ask a question about the 
lesson?" 

Little Susie looked puzzled for a 
moment, and then raised her hand. 

"A question, Susie?" asked the teacher. 

"I would like to know," said Susie, 
"if the angels have wings, why did they 
have to climb up the ladder?" 

The teacher thought for some mo- 
ments, and then, looking about the class, 
asked; "Is there any little boy who 
would like to answer Susie's question'" 



The Real Question 

"My son." said the father impress- 
ively; "suppose I should be taken 
away suddenly, what would become 
of you?" 

"Why," said the son irreverently. 
"I'd stay here; the question is, what 
would become of you?" — Ladies Home 
Journal.
