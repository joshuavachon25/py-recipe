Pickles get, and salad both, 

Let them each be fresh and green.

MIDNIGHT 
FEASTS 

Up and down the line, from youth 
to old age, there are none but seem 
to be eager for light on culinary sub- 
jects. As it is evidently such a source 
of -perennial interest to all, naturally 
many of us feel that we may have a 
message of special service— that might 
possibly be considered the li best ever" 
-to promote information along these 
lines. 

There are few social relaxations 
that are pleasanter than midnight 
suppers, and they have always had a 
certain secret fascination, as of for- 
bidden temptations. With those who 
are fond of fun, laughter and a good 
deal of nonsense, and especially with 
those whose digestions are in good 
working order, there is nothing so 
popular. 

There was a time, in benighted 
ages, when it was considered the 
height of indiscretion to eat late at 
night, but in these advanced times, 
old-fashioned theories are gradually 
passing, and in eliminating one stupid- 
ity after another, we have come to 
consider suppers at night, after a 
sociable evening of any kind, both 
wholesome and beneficial. If we are 
hungry we are unhappy, and accord- 
ing to the most sensible philosophy, 
why should we go to bed unhappy, 
when alleviation lies right at hand, 
in our pantry?

Midnight Feasts 

To the college boy and the college 
girl, these late repasts are the very 
soul of their good fellowship, and not 
only do they lavish here the very 
best of their friendship, but the very 
best of their wit and brains. In fact, 
if the truth were known, all up-to- 
date people like these little " lay outs" 
and indulge in them night after night, 
not only with the keenest relish and 
appetite, but with no after doleful 
repentance. 

We hear the cry all over the 
land, that people are no longer doing 
as their forefathers did, and progress 
and cookery are bound to go hand in 
hand. Still there are always the con- 
ventional ones, and the doubting ones, 
and to these there is the assurance 
that many of the new ideas contained 
in this little book are really old ones, 
dressed in modern taste, and all are 
unusually good and sure to bring 
forth, even from the most skeptical, 
delicious thrills and ecstasies of de- 
light. 

To blend a salad is a work of art 
and the highest perfection lies in sim- 
plicity. The creative qualities re- 
quired in this kind of culinary effort 
are peculiar, and have a standard of 
their own. It really requires a per- 
son of ideas to concoct a perfect salad, 
so much depends on the blending and 
the seasoning— not as to salt and pep- 
per alone, but in the delicate flavor 
it is possible to impart by a judicious 
combination of relishes. A subtle 

IV 



Midnight Feasts 

sense in this difficult mixing, with no 
guessing as to the result, glorifies the 
most commonplace materials. 

The blue flame and copper kettle 
are most popular wherever informal- 
ity and sociability reign. The chafing- 
dish is such a dependable little asset 
in all sorts of entertaining that its 
lure is felt by everyone. Boys and 
even men, real manly men, find in it 
genuine sport, if they only have the 
nerve to acknowledge it, and to open- 
ly avail themselves of its fascination. 

All the attractive hot dishes this 
little book contains, can be cooked in 
the cosy little chafing-dish. There 
are some that are simplified from old- 
time methods of scientific cookery, or 
as it might be called "scientific drudg- 
ery" that can now, according to 
"Midnight Feasts" be prepared 
with little trouble and comparative- 
ly small expense. The creed of every- 
one in selecting from these good 
things combinations for their spreads, 
should be to choose two things that 
harmonize from a gastronomic stand- 
point. This will require a little pre- 
liminary planning, but the success and 
attractiveness of your feasts depend 
on making things balance in this way. 
With a hearty chafing-dish concoc- 
tion use a simple salad, and vice 
versa, and in that way, with such a 
wealth of material to select from, 
even those with real appetites will 
be satisfied.

&T MAYONNAISE <T 

PLACE in a shallow plate the 
yolk of one egg, and beat 
well with a silver fork. Add 
drop by drop, stirring constantly, 
about a half-pint of olive-oil. When 
it is thick and jelly-like cut with a 
tablespoonful of vinegar or lemon- 
juice and season with a saltspoon- 
ful of salt and pinch of cayenne. 
Have plate and all materials very 
cold. Should the egg curdle and 
obstinately refuse to thicken com- 
mence on another plate with a 
fresh yolk, and after it begins to 
thicken the curdled mayonnaise 
may be slowly added. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

ONE saltspoonful of salt and 
half a saltspoonful of pep- 
per, beaten with three table- 
spoonfuls of olive-oil; when thick 
and creamy, add slowly one table- 
spoonful of vinegar or lemon-juice. 
This should never be mixed or put 
over the salad until the moment it 
is to be eaten. If liked, a tea- 
spoonful of scraped onion can be 
added. 

All lettuce and uncooked vege- 
tables should be very fresh, well 



washed, thoroughly dried and put 
aside in some cold place until they 
are perfectly crisp. Use only the 
best pure olive-oil.

CHOOSE the small California 
oysters, so as not to cut 
them. Turn off the liquor, 
wash and drain, and to every cup- 
ful of these add a cupful of crisp 
white celery, cut into half-inch bits, 
and then split lengthwise. Mix 
these with mayonnaise dressing 
and put on the ice. When ready

tuce leaves, put the salad on top, 
garnished with pitted olives cut in 
half, and serve with mayonnaise.

a spoonful of mayonnaise on the 
leaf and one stuffed pimento.

boiling water for a moment to 
loosen it, and is then turned out 
on a bed of lettuce leaves, which 
are arranged on a round, flat plat- 
ter. The rest of the shrimps are 
piled in the middle with tiny heart 
leaves of the lettuce. Serve with 
rich mayonnaise and decorate with 
cut lemon.

REMOVE the meat of a lob- 
ster, reserving the creamy fat 
adhering to the body shell 
and the coral. Shred the lobster 
with a silver fork and cut the 
tender white part of celery into 
pieces the same size, allowing one- 
third as much as the amount of 
meat. Arrange the crisp, dry white 
lettuce leaves in the center of an 
oval platter, with the larger green 
on the outer edge, decorated with 
the claws. Mix the lobster meat 
and celery together with enough 
mayonnaise to moisten it, and heap

SELECT medium large toma- 
toes of uniform size, remove 
the skins and carefully cut a 
piece from the top large enough to 
scoop out center, which is filled 
with small shrimps or chopped 
large ones, mixed with the tarragon 
mayonnaise. For the mayonnaise 
wash the tarragon leaves and put 
in boiling salted water for ten min- 
utes, cool, squeeze dry and work 
through a sieve. Color the may- 
onnaise with this; or use the 
tarragon vinegar in mixing mayon-

salt and paprika and put on a bed 
of lettuce leaves. Pour over it a 
dressing made of the yolks of two 
hard-boiled eggs, rubbed smooth, 
with sufficient oil to make it like 
thick cream; thin with a little 
10 



lemon-juice and season with salt 
and white pepper. Garnish the 
dish with the white rings of the 
hard-boiled eggs, and have all icy 
cold.

in cold salt water for an hour, 
and then cook them for 
twenty-five minutes; drain, and 
marinate them by sprinkling over 
them one tablespoonful of vinegar, 
two of lemon-juice, and a pinch of 
salt; let them remain overnight 
on the ice. When ready to serve, 
make a mound of finely shredded 
cabbage, celery and green pepper, 
placing the cut scallops on top and 
decorating with pickled peppers 
and pimolas. Use a boiled cream 
mayonnaise, which is made by 
beating the yolks of three eggs 
lightly and adding one tablespoon- 
ful each of thick sweet cream, fresh 
butter and lemon-juice; one tea- 
spoonful each of sugar and made 
mustard, a little celery salt, salt 
and pepper. Put in a double 
boiler and stir constantly until it

TAKE the shells from hard- 
boiled eggs while hot and 
put them in warm beet-juice 
and water, and let stand until col- 
ored a delicate pink. Make a 
bed on each individual plate of 
small lettuce leaves by placing

wise, remove the yolks whole and 
place each half in the center over 
the ends of the lettuce leaves; 
around this arrange the pink white 
of the egg, cut in narrow oval 
lengthwise strips to resemble the 
17 



petals of a flower. Put on ice, 
and just before serving pour over 
it a rich French dressing. Serve 
with this salad, Welsh sandwiches, 
which are made by rubbing together 
one part sweet butter and two parts 
mild soft cheese, flavored with tar- 
ragon vinegar, and putting between 
thin slices of bread.

SWEET 



THE chafing-dish possibilities 
are unlimited. To the epi- 
cure it insures good service 
and hot dishes; to the woman who 
does her own work it is the most 
convenient of all utensils, and is 
valued by the amateur for the fun 
of it, and seems always a synonym 
for hospitality and an appetite. 

It is placed on a metal tray for 
safety and cleanliness, and one with 
a lower pan for hot water is almost 
a necessity, in cooking, and to 
keep the dishes warm. 

Most of the foods for the vari- 
ous dishes are prepared beforehand 
in the kitchen and placed, with the 
seasonings needed, conveniently at 
hand in dishes and on trays.

* AUNT DINAH * 

SCALD four cupfuls of milk 
with a slice of onion, two stalks 
of celery, two blades of mace, 
a sprig of parsley and a bay leaf. 
Remove the seasonings and add 
the strained liquor from a quart of 
oysters, pepper and salt, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter creamed 
with two of flour. Cook all to- 
gether, and then put in the oysters 
and cook until they are plump and 
the edges begin to curl. 

> BATTER LOAF * 

MIX four tablespoonfuls of 
sifted flour, one of olive- 
oil, a little salt and the 
beaten whites of two eggs; add 
enough warm water to make a 
rather thick batter. Take two 
dozen large oysters, dry them on 
a soft cloth, dust each oyster very 
lightly with salt and pepper and 
dip separately into the batter and 
fry a golden brown in deep olive- 
oil. Serve on a napkin with sliced 
lemon. 

* BUNDLES * 

CUT nice, even slices of the 
breast of cold roast turkey; 
over each piece lay a thin 
shaving of bacon, and put on top 
of each piece of bacon a large, fat 
oyster. Roll these bundles up 
and tie securely, season with pep- 

79 



per and salt, and place in the pan 
with melted butter. Cover and 
cook long enough to cook the ba- 
con, basting frequently with the 
melted butter. Serve with a sprig 
of parsley on each one and pour 
over the brown gravy thickened 
with a little flour. 

* COCKTAIL * 

TAKE a pint of small oysters 
with the liquor that comes 
with them; add a cupful of 
tomato catsup, the juice of two 
lemons, one tablespoonful of Wor- 
cestershire sauce, salt and six drops 
of tabasco. Heat in the chafing- 
dish and serve hot in cocktail- 
glasses. 

* EN CACHETTE * 

SOAK one cupful of cracker- 
crumbs in as much milk as 
they will absorb; add a tea- 
spoonful of softened butter, one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, a 
dash of white pepper and nutmeg, 
one-half of a tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley and one beaten 
egg yolk. Form into small cakes, 
hide a fat oyster in each one and 
sauter a pale brown in olive-oil. 

* FIGARO OMELET * 

BEAT six eggs very light, and 
add to them a half-cupful of 
sweet cream, salt and pepper 
to taste. Melt a tablespoonful of 

80 



butter in the pan and pour the 
omelets evenly in. Cat twelve 
large oysters in half and scatter 
over the top with a little chopped 
parsley. Fry a light brown, fold 
the omelet over from the two sides, 
and serve at once. 

* GUMBO OYSTERS * 

SAUTER a few dices of salt pork 
with a tablespoonful of minced 
onion until nicely browned; 
add a tablespoonful of flour, and 
when it is well blended with the fat, 
put in a cupful of chicken broth, 
a teaspoonful of minced green 
peppers and a cupful each of 
cooked okra and tomatoes. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper and strain 
in the liquor from a pint of fresh 
oysters. Lastly put in the oysters, 
and as soon as they are plump, 
pour over hot Boston crackers, 
split and buttered. Gumbo pow- 
der can be used instead of the okra. 

OYSTERS A LA 
* POULETTE * 

SCALD two dozen oysters in 
their own liquor until plump, 
and strain. Put in the pan 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, and 
when melted, stir in four table- 
spoonfuls of flour until perfectly 
smooth; then add the oyster-juice, 
one cupful of cream, pepper, salt, 
and a dash of nutmeg. Take 
from the flame, and when a little 
cool, stir in the beaten yolks of 

81 



four eggs and return to the fire 
and stir until thick. Drop the 
oysters in for a second and pour 
immediately on a hot platter.

liquor from the pan, place three or 
four oysters on each piece, and

liquor. Sprinkle over the top a 
little chopped parsley, and garnish 
with lemon slices.

bread on one side only, and serve 
on the untoasted side. 



> STEAMED OYSTERS * 

CAREFULLY wash the shells 
and pack them in the pan 
with their upper shells down- 
ward, so the deep shell will hold 
their juice as they open. Place 
the pan over the hot water and 
cover closely, laying a napkin on 
the top and a weight on the cover. 
Keep the water boiling rapidly 
until the shells open, which will be 
about fifteen minutes. Serve at 
once in the shells, using butter, 
salt and pepper to season them.

salt and pepper and add two table- 
spoonfuls of butter. Lay each one 
on a zephyrette and pour the 
liquor over.

crust. Butter while hot and 
plunge them for an instant into a 
bowl of boiling milk; place them 
on a hot plate and keep warm. 
Put in the pan one-half cupful of 
rich milk and when it is boiling 
hot put in two cupfiils of grated 
cheese. Stir constantly until the 
cheese is melted; then add salt and 
cayenne and the beaten yolks of 
two eggs. Pour over the toast 
and serve instantly.

RELIABLE RAREBIT 

CUT one pound of cheese into 
small pieces, American and 
Cream mixed. Fill the hot- 
water pan half-full of boiling water, 
put the chafing-pan over this and 
into it put a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, half a teaspoonful of dry mus- 
tard, tablespoonful of Worcester- 
shire sauce, half a teaspoonful of 
tabasco and a quarter of a cupful 
of beer. When the butter melts 
put in the cheese and stir con- 
stantly; as it melts add beer, a little 
at a time, until it is thoroughly 
melted and smooth like thick 
cream. No cheese is exactly alike 
in the amount of liquid it requires, 
so beer is used to thin until the 
proper consistency is attained. 

* ROULETTES > 

MELT one-half cupful of 
grated cheese in the pan, set 
over boiling water, season 
with salt and Hungarian red pep- 
per; add a tablespoonful of ale 
and pour over thin rounds of but- 
tered toast. Poach four eggs and 
serve on top of the four pieces of 
toast. 

* WELSH RAREBIT * 

PLACE a tablespoonful of but- 
ter in the chafing-dish; add 
two pounds of good Eastern 
cheese chopped fine, a generous 

129 



pinch of salt, one-third of* a tea- 
spoonful of cayenne, four dashes 
of Worcestershire sauce and stir 
vigorously until melted. Then 
add a wine-glass of porter or ale 
and a teaspoonful of Colman's 
mustard and stir until it bubbles. 
Serve on hot toast. Make over 
hot-water pan.

> CANAPE * 

SPLIT in two little squares of 
sponge cake and lay them in 
hot butter in the chafing-dish, 
and brown on both sides. Re- 
move them to a plate and spread 
each layer with canned berries or 
fruit of some kind. Turn the juice 
from the can into the chafing-dish; 
moisten a teaspoonful of arrowroot 
with cold water, stir it slowly into 
the hot juice until it is thick and 
clear, and then pour over the slices 
of spread cake. 

DEVILED ALMONDS 

FRY two ounces of blanched 
and shredded almonds in 
enough olive-oil to keep from 
burning, until well browned. Mix 
together one tablespoonful each of 
Chutney and Worcestershire sauce, 
two of chopped pickles, and a lit- 
tle salt and cayenne; pour over 
the nuts, and serve as soon as 
thoroughly heated. This is nice 
with oysters. 

FRENCH PANCAKE 

BEAT two eggs, whites and 
yolks separately; add one 
cupful of milk to the beaten 
yolks, and one teaspoonful of 
sugar, salt, and one-half of a cupful 
of flour. Beat until smooth, then 
put in one-half of a tablespoonful 
of olive-oil and the beaten whites. 
Grease the cutlet pan with a little 

133 



oil, heat and pour in enough of 
the mixture to cover the bottom; 
when brown, turn and brown the 
other side. Spread each cake with 
butter and jelly. Roll and serve 
at once. 

* FUDGE * 

PUT into the blazer two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, one cup- 
ful of dark brown sugar, half 
a cupful of milk, two cupfuls of 
New Orleans molasses and four 
squares of grated chocolate. Light 
the lamps and stir the mixture con- 
stantly, until it will form a rather 
hard ball when dropped into ice- 
water. Put out the light; add a 
teaspoonful of vanilla, pour into a 
buttered pan and check off in even 
squares while soft. 

* GERMAN TOAST * 

BEAT three eggs lightly, add a 
half-teaspoonful of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
one cupful of milk; strain into a 
shallow dish, put six slices of stale 
bread in the mixture, and soak it 
until soft. Cook in the hot pan 
with plenty of olive-oil or butter; 
brown on one side, turn and brown 
the other side. 

* ORANGE OMELET * 

GRATE the rind from an or- 
ange. Beat the yolks of 
three eggs thoroughly and 
add three tablespoonfuls each of 

134 



powdered sugar and orange-juice, 
and the grated rind. Beat the 
whites stiff, stir them into the 
yolks, and cook like a plain omelet. 
Lay it on the serving-dish, sprinkle 
it thickly with powdered sugar and 
score it in diagonal lines with a 
clean, red-hot poker.

MIDNIGHT 
FEASTS 

Up and down the line, from youth 
to old age, there are none hut seem 
to be eager for light on culinary sub- 
jects. As it is evidently such a source 
of perennial interest to all, naturally 
many of us feel that we may have a 
message of special service— that might 
possibly be considered the" best ever" 
-to promote information along these 
lines. 

There are few social relaxations 
that are pleasanter than midnight 
suppers, and they have always had a 
certain secret fascination, as of for- 
bidden temptations. With those who 
are fond of fun, laughter and a good 
deal of nonsense, and especially with 
those whose digestions are in good 
working order, there is nothing so 
popular. 

There was a time, in benighted 
ages, when it was considered the 
height of indiscretion to eat late at 
night, but in these advanced times, 
old-fashioned theories are gradually 
passing, and in eliminating one stupid- 
ity after another, we have come to 
consider suppers at night, after a 
sociable evening of any kind, both 
wholesome and beneficial. If we are 
hungry we are unhappy, and accord- 
ing to the most sensible philosophy, 
why should we go to bed unhappy, 
when alleviation lies right at hand, 
in our pantry? 

Ill 



Midnight Feasts 
To the college boy and the college 
girl, these late repasts are the very 
soul of their good fellowship, and not 
only do they lavish here the very 
best of their friendship, but the very 
best of their wit and brains. In fact, 
if the truth were known, all up-to- 
date people like these little "-Hay outs" 
and indulge in them night after night, 
not only with the keenest relish and 
appetite, but with no after doleful 
repentance. 

We hear the cry all over the 
land, that people are no longer doing 
as their forefathers did, and progress 
and cookery are bound to go hand in 
hand. Still there are always the con- 
ventional ones, and the doubting ones, 
and to these there is the assurance 
that many of the new ideas contained 
in this little book are really old ones, 
dressed in modern taste, and all are 
unusually good and sure to bring 
forth, even from the most skeptical, 
delicious thrills and ecstasies of de- 
light. 

To blend a salad is a work of art 
and the highest perfection lies in sim- 
plicity. The creative qualities re- 
quired in this kind of culinary effort 
are peculiar, and have a standard of 
their own. It really requires a per- 
son of ideas to concoct a perfect salad, 
so much depends on the blending and 
the seasoning— not as to salt and pep- 
per alone, but in the delicate flavor 
it is possible to impart by a judicious 
combination of relishes. A subtle 

IV 



Midnight Feasts 

sense in this difficult mixing, with no 
guessing as to the result , glorifies the 
most commonplace materials. 

The blue flame and copper kettle 
are most popular wherever informal- 
ity and sociability reign. The chafing- 
dish is such a dependable little asset 
in all sorts of entertaining that its 
lure is felt by everyone. Boys and 
even men, real manly men, find in it 
genuine sport, if they only have the 
nerve to acknowledge it, and to open- 
ly avail themselves of its fascination. 

All the attractive hot dishes this 
little book contains, can be cooked in 
the cosy little chafing-dish. There 
are some that are simplified from old- 
time methods of scientific cookery, or 
as it might be called '■^scientific drudg- 
ery" that can now, according to 
^"■Midnight Feasts" be prepared 
with little trouble and comparative- 
ly small expense. The creed of every- 
one in selecting from these good 
things combinations for their spreads, 
should be to choose two things that 
harmonize from a gastronomic stand- 
point. This will require a little pre- 
liminary planning, but the success and 
attractiveness of your feasts depend 
on making things balance in this way. 
With a hearty chafing-dish concoc- 
tion use a simple salad, and vice 
versa, and in that way, with such a 
wealth of material to select from, 
even those with real appetites will 
be satisfied.

tfT MAYONNAISE ^ 

PLACE in a shallow plate the 
yolk of one egg, and beat 
well with a silver fork. Add 
drop by drop, stirring constantly, 
about a half-pint of olive-oil. When 
it is thick and jelly-like cut with a 
tablespoonful of vinegar or lemon- 
juice and season with a saltspoon- 
ful of salt and pinch of cayenne. 
Have plate and all materials very 
cold. Should the egg curdle and 
obstinately refuse to thicken com- 
mence on another plate with a 
fresh yolk, and after it begins to 
thicken the curdled mayonnaise 
may be slowly added. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

ONE saltspoonful of salt and 
half a saltspoonful of pep- 
per, beaten with three table- 
spoonfuls of olive-oil; when thick 
and creamy, add slowly one table- 
spoonful of vinegar or lemon-juice. 
This should never be mixed or put 
over the salad until the moment it 
is to be eaten. If liked, a tea- 
spoonful of scraped onion can be 
added. 

All lettuce and uncooked vege- 
tables should be very fresh, well 



washed, thoroughly dried and put 
aside in some cold place until they 
are perfectly crisp. Use only the 
best pure olive-oil.

naise made green by mixing with 
it the juice of cold boiled spinach, 
pressed through a sieve. Over all 
sprinkle capers. 



igr BALTIMORE ^ 

CHOOSE the small California 
oysters, so as not to cut 
them. Turn off the liquor, 
wash and drain, and to every cup- 
ful of these add a cupful of crisp 
white celery, cut into half-inch bits, 
and then split lengthwise. Mix 
these with mayonnaise dressing 
and put on the ice. When ready

ing a cupful of picked shrimps 
through it, and put on the ice. 
When firm the mold is held over 
boiling water for a moment to 
loosen it, and is then turned out 
on a bed of lettuce leaves, which 
are arranged on a round, flat plat- 
ter. The rest of the shrimps are 
piled in the middle with tiny heart 
leaves of the lettuce. Serve with 
rich mayonnaise and decorate with 
cut lemon.

it in the bottom of the salad bowl; 
fill with the crisp hearts of the let- 
tuce and pour on the oil in which 
the salt and pepper have been dis- 
solved, toss all up together until 
every leaf is thoroughly covered 
with oil and then squeeze on the 
juice of a lemon; remove the 
"chapon" (the crust) and put the

^ NEWBURG <r 

REMOVE the meat of a lob- 
ster, reserving the creamy fat 
adhering to the body shell 
and the coral. Shred the lobster 
with a silver fork and cut the 
tender white part of celery into 
pieces the same size, allowing one- 
third as much as the amount of 
meat. Arrange the crisp, dry white 
lettuce leaves in the center of an 
oval platter, with the larger green 
on the outer edge, decorated with 
the claws. Mix the lobster meat 
and celery together with enough 
mayonnaise to moisten it, and heap 
in the center. The coral pound

THE chafing-disK possibilities 
are unlimited. To the epi- 
cure it insures good service 
and hot dishes; to the woman who 
does her own work it is the most 
convenient of all utensils, and is 
valued by the amateur for the fun 
of it, and seems always a synonym 
for hospitality and an appetite. 

It is placed on a metal tray for 
safety and cleanliness, and one with 
a lower pan for hot water is almost 
a necessity, in cooking, and to 
keep the dishes warm. 

Most of the foods for the vari- 
ous dishes are prepared beforehand 
in the kitchen and placed, with the 
seasonings needed, conveniently at 
hand in dishes and on trays.

stantly; as it melts add beer, a little 
at a time, until it is thoroughly
