PREFACE. 



One of the sacred writers of the olden time is reportei to have 
said: " Of the making of manj' books, there is no end." This re- 
mark will, to a great extent, apply to the number of works published 
upon the all important subject of Cookery. The oft-repeated saying, 
attributed to old sailors, that the Lord sends victuals, and the oppo- 
site party, the cooks, is familiar to all. 

Notwithstanding the great number and variety of so-called cook- 
books extant, the author of this treatise on the culintiry art, thoroughly 
imjiressed with the belief that there is ample room for one more of a 
thoroughly practical and every day life, common sense character— in 
every way adapted to the wants of the community at large, and looking 
especially to the preparation of healthful, palatable, appetizing and 
nourishing food, both plain and elaborately compounded — and hi the 
preparation of which the very best, and, at the same time, the most 
economical material is made use of, has ventui-ed to present this new 
candidate for the public approval. The preparation of this work 
embodies the result of more than thirty years personal and practical 
experience. The author taking nothing for granted, has thoroughly 
tested the value and entire correctness of every direction he has given 
in these pages. While carefully catering to the varied tastes of the 
mass, everything of an unhealthf ul, deleterious, or even doubtful char- 
acter, has been carefully excluded; and all directions are given in the 
plainest style, so ks to be readily understood, and fully comprehended 
by all classes of citizens. 

The writer having been born and brought up on a farm, and being 
in his younger days of a delicate constitution, instead of joining in 
the rugged work of the field, remained at home to aid and assist his 
mother in the culinary labors of the household. It was in this home- 
sohool — in its way one of the best in the world, that he acquired not 
only a practical knowledge of what he desires to fully impart to others, 
but a taste for the preparation, in its most attractive forms, of every 
variety of palatable and health-giving food. It was his early training 
in this homely school that induced him to make this highly important 
matter an all-absorbing theme and the subject of his entire life study. 
His governing rule in this department has ever been the injunction 
laid down by the chief of the Apostles: "Try all things; prove all 
things; and hold fast that which is good." 



INTRODUCTORY. 



A Beief Histoby of the Culinary Art, and its Principal Methods. 

Cooking is defined to be the art of dressing, compounding and 
preparing food by the aid of heat. Ancient writers upon the subject 
are of opinion that the practice of this art followed immediately after 
the discovery of fire, and that it was at first an imitation of the 
natural processes of mastication and digestion. In proof of the an- 
tiquity of this art, mention is made of it in many places in sacred writ. 
Among these is notably the memoirs of the Children of Israel while 
journeying in the wilderness, and their hankering after the "flesh- 
pots of Egypt." 

Among the most enlightened people of ancient times, — cooking, if 
not regarded as one of the fine arts, certainly stood in the foremost 
rank among the useful. It was a highly honored vocation, and many 
of the most eminent and illustrious characters of Greece and Rome 
did not disdain to practice it. Among the distinguished amateurs of 
the art, in these modern times, may be mentioned Alexander Dumas, 
who plumed himself more upon his ability to cook famous dishes 
than upon his world-wide celebrity as the author of the most popular 
novels of his day. 

In the state in which man finds most of the substances used for 
food they are difficult of digestion. By the application of heat some 
of these are rendered more palatable and more easily digested, and, 
consequently, that assimilation so necessary to the sustenance of life, 
and the repair of the constant waste attendant upon the economy of 
the human system. The application of heat to animal and vegetable 
substances, for the attainment of this end, constitutes the basis of the 
science of cookery. 

Broiling, which was most probably the mode first resorted to in 
the early practice of this art, being one of the most common of its 
various operations, is quite simple and efficacious. It is especially 
adapted to the wants of invalids, and persons of delicate appetites. 
Its effect is to coagulate, in the quickest manner, upon the surface 
the albumen of the meat, effectually sealing up its pores, and thus 
retaining the rich juices and delicate flavor that would otherwise 
escape and be lost. 

Roasting comes next in order, and for this two conditions are 
essentially requisite — a good, brisk fire, and constant basting. As in 
the case of broiling, care should be taken at the commencement to 



VI. INTRODUCTORY. 

coagulate the albumen ou the surface as speedily as possible. Next 
to broiling and stewing, this is the most economical mode of cooking 
meats of all kinds. 

Baking meat is in very many respects objectionable— and should 
never be resorted to when other modes of cooking are available, as it 
reverses the order of good, wholesome cookery, in beginning with a 
slow and finishing with a high temperature. Meats cooked in this 
manner have never the delicate flavor of the roast, nor are they so 
easily digested. 

Bdiling is one of the easiest and simplest methods of cooking, 
but in its practice certain conditions must be carefully observed. The 
fire must be attended to, so 'as 'to properly regulate the heat. The 
utensils used for this purpose, which should be large enough to con- 
tain sufficient water to competely cover the meat, should be scrupu- 
lously clean, and provided with a close-fitting cover. AH scum should 
be removed as fast as it rises, which will be facilitated by frequent 
additions of small quantities of cold water, Difl'ereuce of ojjinion 
exists among cooks as to the propriety of putting meals in cold water, 
and gradually raising to the boiling point, or plauging into water 
already boiling. My own experience, unless in the preparation of 
'soups, is decidedly in favor of the latter. •-• Baron Liebig, the highest 
authority in such matters, decidedly favors this process. As in .the 
case of roasting, the application of boiling water coagulates the albu- 
men, thus retaining the juices of the meat that would be dissolved in 
the liquid. 

Stewing is generally resorted to in the preparation of made 
dishes, and almost every variety of meats are adapted to this method. 
The better-the quality of the meats, as a matter of?, course, the better 
^e dish prepared inthiswsiy; but, by careful stewing, the coarser and 
rougher quality of meats can be rendered soft, tender and digestible, 
a: desirable object not generally attained in other, modes. Add pieces 
:Of meat, trimmings, scraps and bones, the latter containing a large 
•amount of palatabl*^ and nourishing gelatine, may be thus utilized 
in the preparation of wholesome and appetiising dishes at a compara- 
tively trifling cost.

As a matter of strict justice to all parties concerned, the anthor 

of this work deems it proper to explain his reasons for mentioning in 

the body of some of the recipes given in this book, the places at which 

the purest and best aricles used are to be purchased. This recom-

meudation is, in every instance, based upon a thorough and complete 
personal test of every article commended. In these degenerate days of 
wholesale adulteration of almost every article of food and drink, it is 
eminently just and proper that the public should be advised where 
the genuine is to be procured. Without desiring to convert his book 
into a mere advertising medium, the author deems it not out of place 
to give the names of those dealers in this city of whom such articles 
as are essential in the preparation of many of the recipes given in 
these pages may be procured — of the most reliable quality, and at 
reasonable rates.

Stock. 

The foundation — so to speak — and first great essential in com- 
pounding every variety of appetizing, and at the same time 
wholesome and nourishing soups, is the stock. In this depart- 
ment, as in some others, the French cooks have ever been pre- 
eminent. It was said of this class in the olden time that so 
constantly was the "stock" — as this foundation has always been 
termed — replenished by these cooks, that their rule was never 
to see the bottom of the soup kettle. It has long been a fixed 
fact that in order to have good soup you must first have good 
stock to begin with. To make this stock, take the liquor left 
after boiling fresh meat, bones, (large or small, cracking the 
larger ones in order to extract the marrow,) bones and meat left 
over from a roast or broil, and put either or all of these in a 
large pot or soup kettle, with water enough to cover. Let these 
simmer slowly — never allowing the water to boil — taking care, 
however, to keej) the vessel covere(i — stirring frequently, and 



2 Clayton s Quaker Cook-Book. 

pouring in occasionally a cup of cold water, and skimming off 
the scum. It is only where fresh meat is used that cold water 
is applied at the commencement; for cooked meat, use warm. 
The bones dissolved in the slow simmering, furnish the gelatine 
so essential to good stock. One quart of water to a pound of 
meat is the average rule. Six to eight hours renders it fit for use. 
Let stand over night; skim off the fat; put in an earthen jar, 
and it is ready for use. Every family should keep a jar of the 
stock constantly on hand, as by doing so any kind of soup may 
be made from it in from ten to thirty minutes. 

General Directions for Making Soup. 

Having prepared your stock according to the foregoing direc- 
tions, take a sufficient quantity, when soup is required, and sea- 
son, as taste may dictate, with sweet and savory herbs — sal- 
picant, celery salt, or any other favorite seasoning — adding 
vegetables cut fine, and let the same boil slowly in a covered 
vessel until thoroughly cooked. If preferred, after seasoning 
the stock, it may be thickened with either barley, rice, tapioca, 
sago, vermicelli, macaroni, farina or rice flour. A roast onion 
is sometimes added to give richness and flavor. It is a well- 
known fact that soups properly prepared improve in flavor and 
are really better on the day after than when first made. By 
substituting different materials, garnitures, flavorings and condi- 
ments, of which an endless variety is available, the intelligent 
housewife may be able to furnish a different soup for every day 
of the year. In following these, as in all other directions for 
every department of cookery, experience will, after all, be found 
the great teacher and most valuable aid and adjunct to the 
learner of the art. 



Clayton's Quaker Cook-Book. 3 

Calves'-Head Soup. 

Take a calfs head of medium size; wash clean, and soak it 
an hour or more in saUed water; then soak a h'ttle while in fresh, 
and put to boil in cold water; add a little salt and a medium- 
sized onion; take off the scum as it rises, and as the water boils 
away add a little soup stock; when quite tender take the meat 
from the bone, keeping the brain by itself; strain the soup, and 
if you think there is too much meat, use a portion as a side- 
dish dressed with brain sauce; do not cut the meat too fine — and 
season the soup with allspice, cloves and mace, adding pepper 
and salt to taste; put back the meat, and taking one-half the 
brain, a lump of butter, and a spoonful of flour, work to a thin 
batter, stirring in claret and sherry wines to taste, and last of all 
add a little extract of lemon, and one hard-boiled t%'g, chop- 
ped not too fine; if desirable add a few small force-meat balls. 

[Turtle soup may be made in the same manner.] 



Ox -Tail Soup. 

Take one ox-tail and divide into pieces an inch long; 2 
pounds of lean beef cut in small pieces; 4 carrots; 3 onions 
sliced fine; a little thyme, with pepper and salt to taste, and 4 
quarts cold water; boil four hours or more, according to size of 
the ox-tail, and when done add a little allspice or cloves. 

Okra Soup. 

One large slice of ham ; i pound of beef, veal or chicken, 
and I onion, all cut in small pieces and fried in butter together 
until brown, adding black or red pepper for seasoning, along with 



4 Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 

a little salt, adding in the meantime, delicately sliced thin, 
sufficient okra, and put all in a porcelain kettle. For a family 
of four use 30 pods of okra, with 2 quarts water, over a steady, 
but not too hot fire; boil slowly for 3 or 4 hours; when half 
done add 2 or 3 peeled tomatoes. 

Chicken Gumbo. 

[Mrs. E. a. Wilburn's Recipe.] 
For the stock, take two chickens and boil in a gallon of water 
until thoroughly done and the liquid reduced to half a gallon- 
Wipe off i^ pounds of green okra, or if the dry is used, ^ 
pound is sufficient, which cut up fine and add to this stock while 
boiling; next add \\ pounds of ripe tomatoes, peeled and 
chopped fine, adding also \ coffee cupful of rice; let these 
boil for six hours, adding boiling water when necessary; then 
take out the chickens, carve and fry them brown in clear lard; 
into the fat put i large white onion, chopped fine, adding 2 
tablespoon fuls of flour. Just before serving, put the chicken, 
boned and chopped, with the gravy thus prepared, and add to 
the soup with salt and pepper to taste. 

Fresh Oyster Soup. 
Take 25 or 30 small Eastern and 50 California oysters; wash 
clean, and put into a kettle over the fire, with a little over a 
pint of water. As soon as they open pour into a pan and take 
the oysters from the shells, pouring the juice into a pitcher to 
settle. If the oysters are large, cut in two once; return the 
juice to the fire, and when it boils put in a piece of butter 
worked in flour; season with pepper and salt, and let it boil 
slowly for two minutes; put in a cupful of rich milk and the 



Clayton* s Quaker Cook-Book. 5 

oysters, along with a sufficient quantity of chopped crackers, 
and let the liquid boil up once. Should you need a larger 
quantity of soup, add a can of good oysters, as they will change 
the flavor but little. In my opinion nutmeg improves the 
flavor of the soup. 

Fish Chowder. 

Take 4 pounds of fresh codfish — the upper part of the fish is 
best; fry plenty of salt pork cut in small strips; put the fat in the 
bottom of the kettle, then a layer ol the fried pork, next a layer 
of fish; follow with a layer of potato sliced — not too thin — and 
a layer of sliced onions, seasoned with plenty of salt and pepper; 
alternate these layers as long as the material holds out, topping 
off" with a layer of hard crackers. Use equal parts of water and 
milk sufficient to cook, which will not require more than three- 
quarters of an hour, over a good fire. Great care should be 
taken not to scorch in the cooking. 

[Clam Chowder may be made according to the foregoing 
formula, substituting 3 pints of clams for the fish.] 

Clam Soup. 

Take 50 small round clams; rinse clean, and put in a kettle 
with a pint of water; boil for a few minutes, or until the shells 
gape open; empty into a pan, pick the meat from the shells, 
and pour the juice into a pitcher to settle; chop the clams quite 
small; return the juice to the fire, and as soon as hot, work in a 
good-sized lump of butter, with a litde flour, and juice of the 
clams; stir in a teacup of milk; season with black pepper, and 
after letting this boil for two minutes, put in the clams, adding 
at the same time chopped cracker or nudels, and before taking 
up, a little chopped parsley. 



6 Clayton's Quaker Cook-Book. 

Clam Chowder. 

One hundred small clams chopped fine; \ pound fat salt 
pork put in pot and fried out brown; 2 small or i large onion, 
and I tomato chopped fine. Put all in the pot with the clam 
juice and boil for two hours, after which add rolled crackers and 
I pint hot milk, letting it boil up. Season with salt and pepper, 
adding a little thyme if agreeable to taste. 

Baked Beans and Bean Soup. 

Take three pints of white peas or army beans; wash very 
clean; soak eight hours; rinse and put to boil with plenty of 
water, hot or cold, with i^ pounds beef soup-meat and \ pound 
of salt pork, letting these boil slowly, and skimming as the 
scum rises. Stir frequently, as the beans are apt to scorch when 
they begin to soften. When soft enough to be easily crushed 
with the thumb and finger, season with plenty of black pepper 
and salt; after five minutes have elapsed fill a nice baking 
pan — such a one as will do to set on the table — pour in the 
liquid until it nearly covers the beans, score the pork and put it 
half-way down in the beans, and bake in a slow fire until 
nicely browned. 

When the remaining beans are boiled quite soft rub them 
through a colander into the soup; add i pint of milk, and sea- 
son with ground cloves or mace. Just before taking up cut 
some toast the size of the end of a finger and add to the soup. 
Pepper sauce gives a nice flavor. 

Dry Split-Pea Soup. 

Soak one quart dry or split peas ten or twelve hours, and put 
on to boil in i gallon of water, with i pound soup-beef, and a 



Clayton's Quaker Cook-Book. 7 

small piece of the hock end of ham, nicely skinned and trim- 
med, (but if you do not have this at hand supply its place with 
a small piece of salt pork;) season with salt, pepper and a little 
ground cloves, adding a little curry or sweet marjoram ; boil 
slowly until quite tender; rub the peas through a colander, add- 
ing a little rich milk. This soup should be rather thick. Cut 
bread in pieces the size of the little finger, fry in butter or lard, 
and put in the tureen when taken up. 

Tomato Soup. 

To one gallon good beef stock add \\ dozen ripe tomatoes, 
or I two-pound can; 2 carrots, 2 onions and i turnip cut fine; 
boil all together for an hour and a half, and run through a 
fine tin strainer; take a stew-pan large enough to hold the 
liquid, and put it on the fire with \ pound of butter worked in 
two tablespoonfuls of flour; after mixing well together add a 
tablespoonful of white sugar; season with salt and pepper to 
laste, stirring well until the liquor boils, when skim and serve. 
The above quantity will prove sufficient for a large family. 

Celery Soup. 

To make good celery soup take 2 or 3 pounds of juicy beef 
— the round is best, being free from fat. Cover with cold 
water, and boil slowly for three or four hours. An hour before 
taking from the fire take i pound or more of celery, cut 4 or 5 
inches long, taking also the root cut thin, and salting to taste, 
boil until quite tender; then take out the celery, dressing with 
l)epper and salt or drawn butter. If you have some soup stock 
put in a little, boil a few minutes and strain. This is a most 
palatable soup, and the celery, acting as a sedative, is one of 
the best things that can be used for quieting the nerves. 



8 Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 

Pepper-Pot. 

Take thick, fat and tender tripe; wash thoroughly in water in 
which a little soda has been dissolved; rinse well, and cut in 
strips half the length of your little finger; after boiling ten min- 
utes, put in a colander and rinse with a little hot water; then, 
adding good soup stock, boil until tender; season with cayenne 
pepper and salt, a little Worcestershire or Chutney sauce, and 
some small pieces of dough made as for nudels. Should the 
soup not be thick enough add a little paste of butter and flour; 
you may also add curry if you are fond of it. 

This soup was popular in the Quaker City fifty years ago, and 
has never decreased in favor among the intelligent inhabitants.

Boil 3 eggs seven minutes, and mash the yolks with one raw 
egg, a tablespoonful of flour and a little milk; season with pep- 
per, salt, and parsley or summer savory; make into balls and 
boil two or three minutes, and put in the soup just before serv- 
ing. Excellent for both pea and bean soup. 

Nudels. 

Rich nudels undoubtedly form the best thickening for nice, 
delicate soups, such as chicken, veal, oyster and clam. Nudels 
are made with flour, milk and eggs, and a little salt, mixed to 
stiff" dough, rolled as thin as possible, and cut in fine shreds the 
length of the little finger. In all soups where nudels are used, a 
little chopped parsley should be added just before taking up.

Fish. 

The so-termed food fishes are to be found without number in 
all portions of the world, civilized and savage, and a large por- 
tion of the inhabitants of the globe are dependent upon this 
source for their subsistence. Certain learned physiologists have 
put forth the theory that fish-food is brain-producing, and adds 
to the mental vigor of those who subsist upon it. While we are 
not disposed to controvert this consoling idea — if the theory be 
true — the South Sea savages, who live upon this aliment, both 
in the raw and cooked state — and the Esquimaux, whose prin- 
cipal summer and winter diet is frozen fish — should be the most 
intelligent people on earth. 

The modes of preparing fish for the table are equally as nu- 
merous as the species. The direction given by Mrs. Glass, in 
a cook-book of the olden lime, is at the same time the most 
original and most sensible. This lady commences with: 
" P'irst catch your fish." 

Boiled Fish. 

Fresh fish should never lie in water. As soon as cleaned, 
rinse oflf, wipe dry, wrap carefully in a cotton cloth, and put 
into salted boiling water. If cooked in this manner the juice 
and flavor will be fully retained. Twenty minutes boiling will 
thoroughly cook a medium sized fish. 



lO Claytons Quaker Cook-Book. 

Fried Fish. 

In frying large-sized fish, cut the slices lengthwise instead of 
across, for if cut against the grain the rich juices will be lost in 
the cooking, rendering the fish hard, dry and tasteless. For 
. this reason fish are always better cooked whole, when this can 
be done. Beat up one or two eggs, with two tablespoonfuls of 
milk, with salt to season. After dipping the fish in this, dry in 
cracker dust — never use corn meal — and fry in good lard. 

Broiling Fish. 

In broiling fish, cut large as in frying, grease the bars of the 
gridiron. Harden both sides slightly, and baste with butler, 
seasoning with pepper and salt. 

Fried Oysters. 

Take large oysters, drain the juice, and dry them with 
a cloth, and run them in eggs, well beaten with a little milk; 
season with pepper and a little salt, and after drying in cracker 
dust, fry in equal parts best lard and butter, until a light brown. 

Oysters in Batter. 

Save all the juice of the oysters; beat two eggs with two or 
three spoonfuls of milk or cream, seasoning with pepper; put 
this into the juice, with the addition of as much flour as will 
make a rich batter. When the fat is quite hot put into it a 
spoonful of the batter, containing one oyster, and turn quickly 
in order that both sides may be nicely done brown. 



Cla\ ion's Quaker Cook- Book. ii 

Oyster Patties. 

Roll good puff-paste quite thin — and cut in round pieces 3J 
inches in diameter, on which put a rim of dough, about i inch 
or less high, which may be stuck on with a little beaten egg; 
next add a top-piece or covering, fitting loosely, and bake in 
this until a light brown, and put away until wanted. Stew oys- 
ters in their own juice, adding a little butter and cream; fill the 
patties with this, put on the lid, and set in the oven for five 
minutes, and send to the table. Can oysters, with a rich gravy, 
make an excellent patty prepared in this way. 

Stewed Lobsters or Crabs. 

Take a two-pound can of lobster, or two large crabs, and cut 
as for making salad, and season highly with prepared mustard, 
cayenne pepper, curry powder, or sauce piquant, and salt to 
taste. Put in a porcelain siewpan, with a little water, to pre- 
vent scorching, and, after letting it boil up once, add butter the 
size of an t%%, and one tablespoonful of vinegar, or half a tea- 
cupful of while wine, and the juice of half a lemon, and the 
moment this boils add half a teacupful of cream or good milk, 
stirring at the same time. Set the stew aside, and heat up 
shortly before sending to the table. Putting slices of toast in 
the bottom of the dish before serving is a decided improve- 
ment.

Retaining the Juices in Cooking Meats. 

Too little ateniion is paid to one of the most important features 
of the culinary art — particularly in roasting, boiling, and broil- 
ing — that is the retention of the natural juices of various meats 
in cooking. Existing, as these always do, in a liquid form, 
unless this is carefully guarded against, these palatable and 
health-giving essences of all animal food, both tame and game, 
are apt to be wasted and dissipated in various forms, when the 
exercise of mature judgment and a little care would confine 
them to these meats in the course of preparation. By way of 
illustration, let us suppose that a fowl, a leg of mutton, or some 
of the many kinds of fish frequently served up in this way, is 
to be boiled in water. If put in cold water, and the heat grad- 
ually raised until it reaches the boiling-point, the health-giving 
albumen — with the juices which give each its peculiar and 
pleasant flavor — are extracted from the meat and dissolved and 
retained in the water, rendering the flesh and fish insipid and 
in some cases almost tasteless. If, however, these are plunged 
at once into boiling water, thereby on the instant coagulating 
the albumen of the surface at least, and thereby closing the 
pores through which the inside albuminous juices would other- 
wise exude and be lost. Besides this albumen, there are other 



Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 13 

juices which are among the most important constituent parts of 
every variety of animal food in which are embodied much of 
its fine flavor and nutritive qualities, and deprived of which such 
food becomes unpalatable and tasteless. All meats, then, in- 
stead of being put into cold water, should at the start be 
plunged into boiling hot water, as this prevents the escape of 
these juices, and the retaining not only the delicate and fine 
flavor of the meat, but confining and retaining its nutritive 
qualities where they naturally and properly belong. 



Roast Pig. 

Take a sucking pig-- one from three to five weeks old is 
best. When properly dressed lay in salted water for half an 
hour; take out and wipe dry inside and out; make a stuffing of 
bread and butter, mixing to a proper consistency with milk and a 
well beaten egg; season with salt, pepper and sage, with the 
addition of thyme or summer savory, anJ an onion chopped 
fine and stewed in butter with flour. Sew up, and roast for a 
long time in an oven not too hot, first putting a little water, 
with lard or dripping in the pan Baste frequently until done, 
taking care to keep the pan a little distance above the bottom 
of the ransfe. 



To Roast Turkeys and Chickens. 

Turkeys and chickens for roasting should never be over a 
year old. After being properly cleaned, cut the wings at the 
first joint from the breast, pull the skin down the lower end of 
the neck, and cut off the bone. Cut the necks, wings and giz- 



14 Clarions Quaker Cook- Book. 

zards into small pieces suitable for giblet stew — which should 
be put on the fire before preparing the fowls for roasting — 
which should be done by cutting off the legs at the first joint 
from the feet. Make the stuffing of good bread, rubbed fine, 
with butter, pepper and salt, and a teaspoonful of baking pow- 
der, seasoning with thyme or summer savory, mixing to the 
consistency of dough, adding eggs, well beaten, with good milk 
or cream. Fill the breast, and tie over the neck-bone with 
strong twine, rubbing the sides of the fowl with a dry cloth, 
afterwards filling quite full. Sew up tight, tie up the legs, and 
encase the body with strong twine, wrapped around to hold the 
wings to the body. After rubbing well with salt and dredging 
lightly with flour, put the fowl in a pan, laying on top two or 
three thin slices of fat pork, salt or fresh. Put a little water in 
the pan, and baste frequently, but do not roast too rapidly; 
raise the pan at least two inches from the bottom of the range. 
All white meat should invariably be cooked well done, and 
turkey or chicken, to be eaten cold, should be wrapped while 
warm in paper or cloth. When prepared in this way they will 
always be found soft and tender when cooled. 

When the giblets are stewed tender — which they must be in 
order to be good — chop a handful of the green leaves of celery, 
adding pepper and salt, and put in. Ten minutes before taking 
from the fire add a lump of butler worked in with a tablespoon- 
ful of flour and the yolk of two boiled eggs, letting simmer two 
or three minutes, then put in the whites of the eggs, chopped 
fine, with the addition of a little good milk or cream. Some 
of this stew, mixed wiilythe drippings of the fowl, makes the 
best possible gravy. ^ 



Clayton s Quaker Cook- Book. 1 5 

Roasting Beef. 

Never wash meat; simply wipe with a damp cloth, rub with 
salt and dredge with flour; put in the pan with a little of the 
suet chopped fine, and a teacupful of water; set in a hot oven, 
two inches above the bottom. The oven should be quite hot, 
in order to close the pores on the surface of the meat as quickly 
as possible. As the meat hardens reduce the heat a little, 
basting frequently. Turn two or three limes during the roast- 
ing, taking care not to let the gravy scorch. Meat cooked in 
this way will be tender and juicy, and when done will be slightly 
red in the centre. Should it prove too rare, carve thin and lay 
in a hot pan with a little gravy for one minute. Beef will roast 
in from-one and-half to two hours, according to size. All meats 
may be roasted in the same way, taking care in every case, that 
the albuminous juices do not escape. 

A Good ^Vay to Roast a Leg of Mutton. 

Into a kettle, with hot water enough to cover, put a leg of 
mutton. Let it boil half an hour, and the moment it is taken 
from the water, salt, pepper, and dredge with flour, and put 
on to roast with one-half a teacup of water in the pan. Baste 
frequently, first adding a tablespoonful of lard. Cooked in this 
way the meat has none of the peculiar mutton flavor which is 
distasteful to many. 

Clayton's Mode of Cooking Canvas-back Ducks. 

That most delicately flavored wild fowl, the canvas-back 
duck, to be properly cooked, should be prepared in the following 
style: 



/ 



1 6 Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 

The bird being properly dressed and cleaned, place in the 
opening, after drawing, a tablespoonful of salt dissolved in wa- 
ter — some add a stick of celery, or celery salt, to flavor, but this 
is not necessary. Sew up the opening with strong thread; have 
your fire in the grate red hot — that is, the oven almost red hot; 
place your duck therein, letting it remain nineteen minutes — 
which will be amply sufficient time if your oven is at the proper 
heat — but as tastes differ in this as in other matters of cookery, 
some prefer a minute longer and others one less. Serve the 
duck as hot as possible, with an accompanying dish of hominy, 
boiled, of course; the only condiment to be desired is a Httle 
cayenne pepper; some prefer a squeeze of lemon on the duck; 
others currant jelly; but the simplest and most palatable serving 
is the directions given. 

Clayton's Mode of Cooking California Quail, or 
Young Chickens. 

Split the birds in the back, and wash, but do not let them re- 
main in the water any time; dry with a cloth; salt and pepper 
well, and put in a pan with the inside up; also put in two or 
three slices of fresh or salt pork, and a piece of butter about the 
size of an q%%, with three or four tablespoonfuls of water, and 
set the pan on the upper shelf of the range when quite hot, and 
commence basting frequently the moment the birds begin to 
harden on the top; and when slightly brown turn and serve the 
under side the same way, until that is also a little brown, taking 
care not to scorch the gravy. Having prepared a piece of but- 
tered toast for each bird, lay the same in a hot dish, place the 
birds thereon, and pour the gravy over all. Birds cooked in 
this manner are always soft and juicy — whereas, if broiled, all the 



Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 17 

juices and gravy would have gone into the fire — and should 
you attempt cooking in that way, if not thoroughly, constantly 
basted, they are liable to burn; and if basted with butter it runs 
into the fire, smoking and destroying their rich natural flavor. 

I have been thus particular in the directions detailed in this 
recipe, from the fact that many people have an idea that the 
quail of California are not equal to that of the Atlantic Slates, 
when, from my experience with both, which has been consider- 
able, I find no difference in the flavor and juiciness of the birds 
when cooked in the way I have carefully laid down in the fore- 
going simple and easily understood directions. 



To Cook Boned Turkey. 

For the filling of the turkey, boil, skin, trim, and cut the 
size of the end of your finger, two fresh calves' tongues. At 
the same time boil for half-an-hour in soup stock, or very little 
water, a medium-sized, but not old, chicken; take all the meat 
from the bones, and cut as the calves' tongues. Take a piece of 
ham, composed of fat and lean, and cut small; also the livers 
of the turkey and the chicken, chopped fine, along with a small 
piece of veal, mostly fat, cut as the chicken, and half an onion 
chopped fine. 

Put all these into a kettle with water to half cover, and stew^ 
until tender. At the time of putting on the fire, season with 
salt and pepper, ground mace, salpicant, celery salt and a little 
summer savory. Just before taking from the fire stir in the 
yolks of two eggs, well beaten, wiih three or four truffles chop- 
ped the size of a pea, and a teacupful of sherry or white wine. 
When this mixture is cold put it in the turkey, with the skin 



1 8 Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 

side out; draw it carefully around the filling, and sew up with a 
strong thread; and after wrapping it very tightly with strong 
twine, encase it in two or three thicknesses of cotton cloth, at 
the same time twisting the ends slightly. These precautions 
are necessary to prevent the escape of the fine flavor of this 
delicious pref>aration. Boil slowly for four hours or longer, in 
good soup stock, keeping the turkey covered with the liquid, 
and the vessel covered also. When taken up lay on a level 
surface, with a weight, to flatten the two sides a little, but not 
heavy enough to press out the juice. When quite cold take off 
the wrapping and thread, and lay on a nice large dish, garnish- 
ing with amber jelly cut the size of peas. 

To Bone a Turkey. 

Use a French boning knife, five inches in length and sharp 
at the point. Commence by cutdng off the wings at the first 
joint from ttie breast; then the first joint from the drum-sticks, 
and the head, well down the neck. Next place the bird firmly 
on the table, with the breast down, and commence by cutting 
from the end of the neck, down the centre of the back, through 
to the bone, until you reach the Pope's nose. Then skin or 
peel the flesh as clean as possible from the frame, finishing at 
the lower end of the breast-bone. 

Chickens may be boned in the same manner. 

To Cook Ducks or Chickens, Louisiana Style. 

Carve the fowls at the joints, making three or four pieces of 
the breast; wash nicely in salted water, and put on to boil with 
water enough to cover, adding a little salt; boil slowly; care- 



Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 19 

fully skimming off the scum. When the meat begins to get 
tender and the water well reduced, cook four onions, chopped 
fine, in a pan with pork fat and butter, dredging in a little flour 
and seasoning with pepper and salt, adding a little of the juice 
from the fowls. Next take up the pieces of .the meat and roll 
in browned flour or cracker-dust, and fry slightly. If the butter 
is not scorched put in a little browned flour; stir in the onion, 
and put it back in the kettle with the meat of the fowl, simmer- 
ing until the gravy thickens, and the meat is thoroughly tender. 

Breast of Lamb and Chicken, Breaded. 

Take the breast of lamb and one chicken — a year old is best 
— and after taking off the thin skin of the lamb, wash it well in 
cold salted water; then put on to boil, with sufficient cold 
slightly-salted water to cover it, and boil until tender — the addi- 
tion of a medium-sized onion improves the flavor — then take 
up, and when quite cold, carve in nice pieces, and season with 
black pepper and sail. Next, beat two eggs, with two or three 
spoonfuls of milk or cream, and a spoonful of flour. After 
running the meat through this, roll in cracker-dust or browned 
Hour, and fry in sweet lard and a little butter until a light brown. 
Next make a cream gravy; take a little of the liquid from the 
chicken, and make a rich thick drawn butter, and thinning it 
with cream, pour over the chicken while it is hot. 

[The liquid used in boiling the chicken will make any kind 
of rich soup for dinner.] 

Scrapple, or Haggis Loaf. 

Take three or four pounds best fresh pork, mostly lean, with 
plenty of bones— the latter making a rich liquid. Put these 
into a kettle, and cover wiih hot or cold water, and let the mass 



20 Clarions Quaker Cook-Book. 

boil slowly for two or three hours, or until quite tender, care- 
fully removing the scum as it rises, after which take the meat 
out into a wooden bowl or tray. Pick out the bones carefully, 
and strain the liquid. After lettin<^ these stand for a few min- 
utes, if in your opinion there is too much fat, remove a portion, 
and then return the liquor to the kettle, addino: pepper and salt, 
and seasoning highly with summer savory. Next stir in two 
parts fine white corn-meal and one part buckwheat flour (Dem- 
ing & Palmer's), until the whole forms quite a thick mush, 
after which, chopping the meat the size of the end of the finger, 
stir thoroughly into the mush. Next put the mixture into 
baking pans to the depth of i^ or 2 inches, and bake in a slow 
oven for two hours, or until the top assumes a light brown — 
taking care not to bake too hard on the bottom. Put in a cool 
place, and the next morning — when, after warming the pan 
slightly — so that the scrapple may be easily taken out — cut 
in slices of half-an-inch thick, which heat in a pan to prevent 
sticking, and serve hot. 

[A small hog's head or veal is equally good for the prepa- 
ration of this dish, which will be found a fine relish ] 

Pigs' Feet and Hocks. 

Have the feet nicely cleaned, and soaked for five or six 
hours, or over night, in slightly salted water. Boil until tender, 
and the large bones slip out easily, which will take from three 
to four hours. Take up, pull out the large bones, arid lay in a 
stone jar, sprinkling on each layer a little salt and pepper, with 
a few cloves or allspice. After skimming off the fat, take equal 
parts of the water in which the feet were boiled, and good 
vinegar, and cover the meat in the jar. 



I 
Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 21 

This nice relish was known as " souse " fifty or sixty years 
ago, and is good, both cold or hot, or cut in slices and fried in 
butter for breakfast. 

To Cook a Steak California Style of i849-'50. 

Cut a good steak an inch and an eighth thick. Heat a griddle 
quite hot, and rub over with a piece of the fat from the steak, 
after which lay on the steak for two or three minutes, or long 
enough to harden the under side of the steak, after which turn 
the other side, treating in the same way, thus preventing all 
escape of the rich juices'of the meat. After this, cut a small 
portion of the fat into small and thin pieces, to which add suffi- 
cient butter to form a rich gravy, seasoning with pepper and salt 
to taste. A steak cooked in this way fully equals broiling, and 
is at the same time quite as juicy and lender. 

A Good Way to Cook a Ham. 

Boil a ten or twelve pound ham slowly for three hours; strip 
off the skin; take a sharp knife and shave off the outer surface 
very thin, and if quite fat take off a little, and spread over 
the fat part a thin coating of sugar. Next put the ham in 
a baking-pan, with one-half pint of white wine, and roast 
half-an-hour. Baste often, taking care that the wine and juice 
of the ham do not scorch, as these form a nice gravy. Whether 
eaten hot or cold the ham should be carved very thin. 

Beefsteak Broiled. 

Place the gridiron over a clear fire; rub the bars with a little 
of the fat, to keep from sticking. The moment it hardens a 
little — which closes the pores of the meat — turn it over, thus 



2 2 Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 

hardening both sides. You may then moisten with butter, or a 
little of the fat of the steak, and season with salt and pepper. 
Lay on a hot dish along with the best butter, which, with the 
juices of the meat, makes the best of gravy, and cooked in this 
style you have a most delicious steak. 

Beefsteak with Onions. 

Take five or six onions; cut fine, and put them in a frying- 
pan, with a small cup of hot water, and two ounces best butter, 
pepper and salt; dredge in a little flour, and let it stew until the 
onions are quice soft. Next broil the steak carefully. Lay on 
a hot dish, and lay the onions around, and not on top, of the 
steak, as that will create a steam, which will wilt and toughen 
it. To be eaten quite hot. 

Corned Beef, and How to Cook It. 

Select a piece of corned beef that is fat The plate or navel 
pieces are best, and should only have been in salt five days 
Put the piece in boiling water in a pot just large enough to hold 
it, along with an onion and a spoonful of cloves or allspice; let it 
boil slowly, skimming the first half hour, if to be eaten cold. 
Take it up as soon as tender, and when cool enough take out 
the bones and place the meat in a vessel just large enough to 
hold it, and pour in the fat, with sufficient hot water to cover it, 
letting it remain until quite cold. 

[Beef tongues should be cooked in the^same way, after laying 
in salt or strong pickle from twenty four to thirty-six hours.] 

Spiced Veal. 

Take three pounds lean veal, parboiled, and one-fourth 
pound salt pork, each chopped fine; six soft crackers pounded; 



Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book 23 

two eggs beaten; two teaspoonfuls of salt, three peppers, one 
nutmeg and a little thyme or summer savory. Mould up like 
bread, and place in a pan, leaving a space all around, in which 
place some of the water in which the meat was boiled. 
Bake until quite brown, and slice when cold. 

Calves' Liver with Bacon. 

Cut both liver and bacon in thin slices, and an inch lohg, 
taking off the skin. Place alternately on a skewer, and broil or 
roast in a quick oven. Dress with melted butter, pepper and 
juice of lemon. 

Calves' or Lambs' Liver Fried 
Slice the liver thin, and season with salt and pepper. Beat 
an t%g with a spoonful of milk or cream. Coat the slices with 
this, and dry in fine cracker dust. Fry in two parts lard and one 
of butter until a light brown. If fried too much the liver will 
be hard and tasteless. Salt pork fried brown is very nice with 
liver, and the fat from the pork will be found excellent to fry 
the liver in. 

Spiced Beef. 

Take 3J pounds lean beef chopped small ; six soda crackers 
rolled fine; 3 eggs well beaten; 4 tablespoonfuls sweet cream; 
butter size of an ^%%\ \\ tablespoonfuls salt, and one of pepper. 
Mix thoroughly, make into a loaf, and bake two hours, basting 
as you would roast beef. 

Fried Oysters. 

Take the largest-sized oysters; drain off the juice, and dry in 
a cloth; beat two eggs in a spoonful of milk, adding a little salt 
and pepper. Run the oysters through this, and fry in equal 
parts butter and sweet lard to a light brown.

STi;WS, SAI^ADS and SAI^AD DRESSING, 



Terrapin Stew. 

Take six terrapins of uniform size. (Tiie females, wliich are 
the best, may be distinguished by the lower shell being level or 
slightly projecting.) If the terrapins are large, use one pound 
of the best butter; if small, less, and a pint of good sherry 
wine. After washing the terrapins in warm water, put them in 
the kettle alive, and cover with cold water, keeping the vessel 
covered tight. After letting them boil until the shell cracks and 
you can crush the claws with the thumb and finger, take them 
off the fire, and when cool enough, pull off the shell and re- 
move the dark, or scarf skin, next pulling the meat from the 
trail and the liver — being careful not to break the gall, which 
would render the liver uneatable. After breaking the meat in 
small pieces, lay it in a porcelain kettle with a teacupful of 
water; put in the wine, and one-half the butter, with 2 or 3 
blades of mace, 2 or 3 teaspoonfuls of extract of lemon, 2 
tablespoonfuls of Worcestershire or Challenge sauce; little salt 
is required, and if pepper is needed, use cayenne. After stew- 
ing for fifteen minutes, add the yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs — 
worked to a paste in the remainder of the butter — thinning with 
the juice of the slew, adding at the same time a teacupful of 
sweet cream, and after simmering for three minutes, chop the 
whites of the eggs fine, and add to the mixture; then take from 
the fire, and make hot five minutes before serving. If kept in 
a cool place this stew will remain perfectly good for three days.

Stewed Chicken, Cottage Style, with White Gravy. 

Take two chickens, one or two years old, and cut each in 
about fourteen pieces, dividing each joint, and cutting the breast 
in two pieces; cut the gizzard quite small, and put it and the 
liver with the chicken. When the chicken is half done, cover 
with cold water, adding a good-sized onion, and when it reaches 
a boil, skim carefully; and when the same is about half cooked 
add sufficient salt and pepper, and also a handful of the green 
leaves of celery chopped fine, which will give it the flavor of 
oysters. Boil slowly until you can tear the chicken with a fork, 
when turn it out in a dish. Next, take one half pound of good 
butter, the yolks of three boiled eggs, and two tablespoonfuls of 
corn-starch or flour, and, after working well together, so as to 
form a thin batter, add the liquor from the chicken, return to 
the kettle, and, after boiling for five minutes, return the chicken, 
season with nutmeg or sal-piquant, adding at the same time a 
teacupful of cream or good milk, also the whites of the eggs, 
chopped fine. Keep hot until served. 

Stewed Tripe. 

Cut and prepare the tripe as for pepper-pot; season highly; 
add a pint of soup stock, and four spoonfuls of tomatoes, wiih a 
little butter, and half an onion chopped fine. Cook until quite 
tender. 

Chicken Salad. 

Boil a good-sized chicken, not less than one year old, in as 
little water as possible; if you have two calves' feet boil them at 
the same time, salting slightly, and leaving them in after the 
chicken is cooked, that they may boil to shreds. This liquid 



26 Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 

forms a jelly, which is almost indispensable in making good 
salad. When the chicken becomes cold, remove the skin and 
bones, after which chop or cut to the size of a pea; cut celery 
and lettuce equally fine — after taking off the outer fibre of the 
former — and mixing, add Clayton's Salad Dressing, (the recipe 
for which will be found elsewhere); also incorporating four 
eggs, which should be boiled eight minutes, cutting three as fine 
as the chicken and celery, and leaving the fourth as a garnish 
on serving. Cold roast turkey, chicken or tender veal make 
most excellent salad treated in this way. 



Clayton's Celebrated California Salad Dressing. 

Take a large bowl, resembling in size and shape an ordinary 
wash-bowl, and a wooden spoon, fitted as nearly as possible to 
fit the curve of the bowl. First put in two or three tablespoon- 
fuls of mixed mustard, quite stiff". Pour on this, slowly, one- 
fourth of a pint of best olive oil, stirring rapidly until thick ; 
then break in two or three fresh eggs, and, after mixing slightly, 
pour in, very slowly, the remaining three-fourths of the pint of 
oil, stirring rapidly all the while until the mixture forms a thick 
batter. Next, take a teacupful of the best wine vinegar, to which 
the juice of one lemon has been added, along with a small 
tablespoonful of salt, and another of white sugar, stirring well, 
until the whole of these ingredients are thoroughly incorpo- 
rated. When bottled and tightly corked, this mixture will re- 
main good for months. Those who are not fond of the oil, 
will find that sweet cream, of about sixty or seventy degrees in 
temperature, a good substitute; but this mixture does not keep 
so well.

Salad Flavoring. 

It will be found a good thing before ornamenting a salad, to 
take a section of garlic, and, after cutting off the end, steeping 
it in salt, and then rubbing the surface of the bowl, putting in 
at the same time, small pieces of the crust of French or other 
bread, similarly treated. Cover the bowl with a plate, and 
shake well. This gives the salad a rich, nutty flavor. 

Eggs and Omelettes. 



Boiling Eggs. 

Unless quite sure the eggs are fresh, never boil them, as the 
well known remark that even to suspect an q^% cooked in this 
style is undoubtedly well-founded. Hard boiled eggs, to be 
eaten either hot or cold, must never be boiled more than eight 
minutes, when they will be found tender and of a fine flavor, 
whereas, if boiled for a longer time, they will invariably prove 
leathery, tough, and almost tasteless, and dark-colored wliere 
the whites and yolk are joined, giving them an unsightly and 
anything but attractive appearance. 

For soft boiled, three, and for medium, four minutes only, 
are necessary. 

Scrambled Eggs. 

Beat well three eggs, with two tablespoonfuls of cream or 
milk; add salt and pepper; put in the pan a lump of fresh but- 



28 Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 

ter, and, as soon as melted, put in the e^gs, stirring rapidly 
from the time they begin to set; as in order to be tender they 
must be cooked quickly. 



To Fry Eggs. 

Put butter or lard in a hot pan, and then as many small, deep 
muffin rings as eggs required. Drop the eggs in the rings. 
Cooked in this manner the eggs are less liable to burn, look far 
nicer, and preserve their fine flavor. 

Oyster Omelette. 

Stew a few oysters in a little butter, adding pepper for season- 
ing, and when the omelette is cooked on the under side, put 
on the oysters, roll over, and turn carefully. A good omelette 
may be made of canned oysters treated in this way. 

Ham Omelette. 

Take a thin slice of the best ham — fat and lean — fry well 
done, and chop fine. When the omelette is prepared, stir in 
the ham, and cook to a light brown. 

Cream Omelette. 

Beat three eggs with two tablespoonfuls of cream, adding a 
little salt and pepper. Put a lump of butter in the pan, but do 
not let it get too hot before putting in the mixture. The pan 
should be about the temperature for baking batter cakes. Fold 
and turn over quite soon. The omelette should be a light 



Clmtons Quaker Cook- Book. 29 

brown, and be sent to the table hot. Should you have sausage 
for breakfast, the bright gravy from the sausage is preferable to 
butter in preparing the omelette. 

Spanish Omelette. 

Make in the same manner as the cream omelette, but before 
putting in the pan have ready one-half an onion, chopped fine 
and fried brown, with a little pepper and salt. When the 
omelette is cooked on one side, put the mixture on, and turn 
the sides over until closed tight. 

Omelette for Dessert. 

Beat eight eggs thoroughly, with a teacup of rich milk or 
cream, a tablespoonful of fine white sugar, and a very little salt. 
Stir well, and make in two omelettes; lay side by side, and sift 
over a thin coating of fine white sugar. In serving, pour over 
and around the omelette a wine-glass of good California brandy, 
and set on fire.

VEGETABI^K3 



-^-^^-^i- 



Baked Tomatoes. 



. Pick out large, fair tomatoes; cut a slice from the stem end, 
and, placing them in a pan with the cut side up, put into each 
one-half teaspoonful of melted butter, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and bake until they shrivel slightly. 

Raw Tomatoes. 

Cut the skin from both ends; slice moderately thin, and, if 
you like, add a small piece of onion chopped fine. Season 
with salt and pepper, and pour over Durkee's or Clayton's salad 
dressing. 

Cucumbers. 

Take oif a thick rind, as that portion between the seed and 
outer skin is the unwholesome part. Slice, rather thin, into 
cold, salt water, and, after half-an-hour, drain ofT, and dress with 
salt, pepper, wine vinegar, and a little Chile pepper-sauce, 
covering slightly with Durkee's or Clayton's salad dressing. 

Boiled Cabbage. 

Cut large cabbage in four; small in I wo pieces, and tie up in 
a bag or cloth. Put in boiling waier, with some salt, and boil 
briskly for half-an-hour. A piece of charcoal in the pot will 
neutralize the odor given out by the cabbage, boiled in the 



Clavtons Quaker Cook- Book. 31 

ordinary way. Cabbage should never be cooked with corned- 
beef, as the fine flavor of the latter is changed to the strong odor 
of the cabbage. 

To Cook Cauliflower. 

!f the cauliflower is large, divide in three, if small, in two 
pieces; tie up in a cloth, and put in boiling water with a little 
salt, and cook not more than twenty minutes. Eat with melted 
butter, pepj)er and salt, or nice drawn butter. 

[Asparagus may be cooked in the same way, and eaten with 
similar dressing. Both cauliflower and asparagus may be 
spoiled with loo much cooking. Care should be taken to drain 
the water from both as soon as they are done.] 



To Cook Young Green Peas. 

The best mode of cooking this most delicate and finely- 
flavored vegetable — put the peas in a porcelain-lined kettle, with 
just water sufficient to cover, and let them boil slowly until ten- 
der. Add a lump of butter, worked in a teaspoonful of flour, 
to the rich liquid, with half a teacupful of rich milk or cream; 
season with salt and pepper. 

A Good Way to Cook Beets. 

Take beets of a uniform size; boil until tender; slip off the 
skin, and slice into a dish or pan; season with salt and pepper, 
adding a little butter, made hot, and the juice of one lemon. 
Pour this over the beets, set in a hot oven for a few minutes, 
and send to the table hot. 



32 Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 

Mashed Potatoes and Turnips. 

Take equal quantities of boiled potatoes and turnips; mash 
together, adding butter, salt and pepper, and mix thoroughly 
with a little good milk, working all together until quite smooth. 

Boiled Onions. 

Take small white onions, if you have them; if large, cut and 
boil until tender, in salted water. Pour off nearly all the water, 
and add a small lump of butter, worked in a little flour, and a 
small cup of milk; add pepper, and simmer for a few minutes. 

[All the foregoing are desirable additions to roast turkey and 
chicken.] 

Stewed Corn. 

If canned corn is used, put a sufficient quantity in a stewpan, 
with two or three spoonfuls of hot water, and, after adding pep- 
per and salt to taste, put in a good-sized lump of butter, into 
which a teaspoonful of flour has been well worked, adding, at 
the same time, a cup of good, sweet milk or rich cream, and 
let it cook three minutes. Corn cut fresh from the cob should 
be boiled at least twenty minutes before adding the milk and 
butter. 

Stewed Corn and Tomatoes. 

Take equal quantities of corn and tomatoes, and stew together 
half-an-hour, with butter, pepper and salt; and when taken up 
place slices of buttered toast in the dish in which it is served. 



Claytons Quaker Cook- Book, 33 

Succotash. 

This is the original native American Indian name for corn 
and beans. In compounding this most palatable and whole- 
some dish, take two or three pounds of green, climbing, or pole 
beans — the pods of which are large, and, at the same time, ten- 
der. Break these in pieces of something like half-an-inch long, 
and let them lie in cold water about half-an-hour, at which time 
drain this off. Put them in a porcelain-lined kettle, covering 
them with boiling water, into which put a large tablespoonful 
of salt. When the beans become tender, pour off the greater 
portion of the water, replacing it wiih that which is boiling, and 
and when the beans become entirely tender, cut from the cob 
about half the amount of corn you have of the beans, which boil 
for twenty minutes; but where canned corn is used five minutes 
will suffice. About five minutes before taking from the fire, 
take a piece of butter about the size of an t%%, worked with 
sufficient flour or corn-starch to form a stiff paste. Season with 
plenty of black pepper and salt to taste, addinjr, at the same 
time, a teacupful of rich milk or cream. Then, to keep warm, 
set back from the fire, not allowing to boil, but simmering 
slowly This will be equally good the next day, if kept in a 
cool place, with an open cover, which prevents all danger of 
souring. This is a simple, healthful, and most appetizing dish, 
inexpensive and at the same time easily prepared. 

Saratoga Fried Potatoes. 

The mode of preparing the world-renowned Saratoga fried 
potatoes is no longer a secret. It is as follows: 

Peel eight good-sized f)Otatoes; slice very thin; use slicing- 



34 Clayton s Quaker Cook- Book. 

machine, when available, as this makes the pieces of uniform 
thickness. Let them remain half-an-hour in a quart of cold 
water, in which a tablespoonful of salt has been dissolved, and 
lay in a sieve to drain, after which mop them over with a dry 
cloth. Put a pound of lard in a spider or stewpan, and when 
this is almost, but not quite, smoking hot, put in the potatoes, 
stirring constantly to prevent the slices from adhering, and when 
they become a light brown, dip out with a strainer ladle. 

[If preferred, cut the potatoes in bits an inch in length, and 
of the same width, treating as above.] 

Salsify or Oyster Plant. 

The best way I have yet found to cook this finely flavored 
and highly delicious vegetable is: First, wash clean, but do not 
remove the skin. Put the roots in more than enough boiling 
water to cover them; boil until quite soft; remove the skin; 
mash; add bulter, and season with pepper and salt; make into 
the size of oysters, and dip in thin q^% batter; fry a light brown. 
If the plant is first put into cold water to boil, and the skin 
scraped or removed, the delicate flavor of the oyster — which 
constitutes its chief merit — will be entirely dissipated and lost. 

Egg Plant. 

There is no more delicate and finely-flavored esculent to be 
found in our markets than the ^%% plant, when cooked in the 
right manner. Properly prepared, it is a most toothsome 
dish; if badly cooked, it is anything but attractive. Of all the 
varieties, the long purple is decidedly the best. Cut in slices, 
less than one-fourth an inch in thickness; sprinkle with salt, and 



Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 35 

let the slices lie in a colander half-an-hour or longer, to drain. 
Next parboil for a few minutes, and drain off the water; season 
with salt and pepper, and dip in egg batter, or beaten t.%%, and 
fry in sweet lard mixed with a little butter, until the slices are a 
light brown. Serve hot. 

To Boil Green Corn. 

Green corn should be put in hot water, with a handful of 
salt, and boiled slowly for half-an-hour, or five minutes longer. 
The minute the corn is done, pour off the water and let it re- 
main hot. All vegetables are injured by allowing them to re- 
main in the water after they are cooked. 

Boiled Rice. 

American rice for all its preparations is decidedly preferable, 
the grain being much the largest and most nutritious. In boil- 
ing, use two measures of water to one of rice, and let them 
boil until the water is entirely evaporated. Cover tightly; set 
aside, and let steam until every grain is separated. When 
ready to serve, use a fork in removing the rice from the cook- 
ing utensil. • 

[The foregoing recipe was given me by a lady of South Caro- 
lina, of great experience in the preparation of this staple cereal 
product of the Southern Atlantic seaboard.] 

Stewed Okra. 

Cut into pieces one quart of okra, and put to boil in one cup 
of water; add a little onion and some tomatoes; salt and pep- 
per to taste; and when all is boiled tender, add a good lump 
of butter, worked in with a spoonful of flour, and let stew five 
minutes, stirring frequently.

these come to a boiling heat, stirring well at the same time, 
then pour in the meal, and beat to a stiff consistence. Turn 
into a baking pan, and bake until thoroughly done, brown on

yolks of the eggs — putting the whites in last. Work into a thick 
batter, and bake steadily for three-quarters of an hour; to be 
eaten hoi. 

Icing for Cake. 

There are a number of formulas for the preparation of icings 
for cake, but the following will invariably be found the sim- 
plest, easiest prepared, and the best: 

Take the whites of 4 eggs, and i pound of best pulverized 
white sugar, and any flavoring extract most agreeable to the 
taste. Break the whites of the eggs into a broad, cool dish, and 
after throwing a small handful of sugar upon them, begin whip- 
ping it in with long even strokes of the beater. Beat until the 
icing is of a smooth, fine and firm texture. If not stiff enough, 
put in more sugar, using at least a quarter of a pound to each 



Clavtons Quaker Cook- Book. 41 

eg2;. Pour the icing by the spoonful on top of the cake, and 
near the centre of the surface to be covered. If the loaf is so 
shaped that the liquid will naturally settle to its place, it is best 
left to do so. To spread it/use a broad-bladed knife, dipped in 
cold water; if as thick with sugar as should be, one coat will be 
amply sufficient. Leave in a moderate oven for three minutes. 
To color icing yellow, use the rind of a lemon or orange, tied in 
a thin muslin bag, straining a little of the juice through it and 
squeezing hard into the ice and sugar; for red, use extract of 
cochineal. 

Chocolate Icing. 

Quarter of a cake of chocolate grated, \ cup of sweet milk, 1 
tablespoonful corn-starch; flavor with extract of vanilla. Mix 
these ingredients, with ihe exception of the vanilla; boil two 
minutes, and after it has fairly commenced to boil, flavor, and 
then sweeten to taste with powdered sugar, taking care to have it 
sweet enough. 

Lemon Pie. 

Grated rind and juice of two lemons; 2 cups sugar; butter, 
the size of an egg; 2 tablespoonfuls corn -starch; 4 eggs. Rub 
the butter and sugar smooth in a little cold water; have ready 
2 cups boiling water, in which stir the corn-starch, until it looks 
clear; add to this the butter and sugar, and, when nearly cold, 
the yolks of four eggs, and the while of one, well beaten, and 
the rind and the juice of the lemons. After lining two deep 
dishes with a delicate paste, and pouring in the mixture, beat 
the remaining whites of the eggs to a stiff frolh, adding two 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar. Spread this over the pies when 
done, returning 10 the oven to brown.

be boiled, but is much better steamed, as this makes it much 
lighter. This delicious pudding should be eaten with brandy or 
wine sauce, liquid or solid. 



46 Clayton s Quaker Cook-Book. 

Charlotte-a-Russe. 

Take i pint rich milk, i ounce of gelatine, dissolved in a 
little hot milk, the whites of 2 (tg^i beaten to a froth, and i cup

all of these well together, that the ingredients may be thoroughly 
incorporated, and season with nutmeg or cinnamon, or both, as 
may be preferred. 

Liquid Sauce. 

Take butter, the size of an egg, and sufficient flour or corn- 
starch, and after adding boiling water to make thick drawn but- 
ter, boil two or three minutes; add brandy, sherry or white-

put the jelly in a kettle, with one pint of California sherry, 
or white wine, 3 cups granulated sugar, the whites of 4 eggs, 
well beaten, the juice of i lemon, with half of the grated peel 
I teaspoonful of ground cinnamon or nutmeg; boil until clear, 
and strain into moulds or glasses. 

Ice-Cream. 

There are a thousand and one modes and recipes for making 
ice-cream. But, after having tested the merits of a large num- 
ber, I have found the following formula, used by Mr. Piper, the 
former head cook of the Occidental Hotel, of San Francisco, 
in all respects superior to any that 1 have ever used: 

One quart of Jersey, or best dairy milk, with the addition of 
a pint of rich cream; 6 eggs, and i pound of best granulated 
white sugar, thoroughly beaten and incorporated together; place 
the milk in a can, set it in a vessel of boiling water, and let it 
come to a boiling heat, stirring well at the same time. Then 
lake from the fire, and add vanilla, lemon, or such flavoring as 
you may prefer, after which set it in ice-water to cool, and then 
freeze. Break the ice for the freezer of a uniform size, mixing: 



48 Clayton s Quaker Cook- Book. 

coarse salt with the mass. Stir the cream constantly, and scrape 
thoroughly from the sides. The more the cream is stirred, the 
more delicate the mixture will be. 

Orange -Ice. 

The juice of 6 oranges; after adding the grated rind of i 
mix the juice of two lemons, and the grated rind of one; after 
adding i pint of granulated white sugar, dissolved in a pint of 
cold water, freeze the mixture the same as ice cream. 

Lemon Jelly. 

One pound sugar; 3 lemons, sliced, and put into the sugar; 
I ounce gelatine, dissolved in cold water sufficient to cover; add 
a quart of boiling water, and strain into moulds. 

Wine Jelly. 

One box Cox's gelatine, dissolved in a little warm water; add 
a large goblet sherry wine, and i^ pints of boiling water; 
sweeten highly and boil briskly. To be eaten with cream. 

Peach Jelly. 

Do not pare, but rub your peaches; place them in a porce- 
lain lined kettle, with just enough water to cover. Let them 
cook thoroughly — from one to two hours — then strain through 
a jelly-bag. To every 4 cuf)s of juice, add 3 cups of sugar, and 
set on to boil again. Sometimes, when the fruit is particularly 
fine and fresh, three-quarters of an hour or less boiling is suffi- 
cient to make a jelly, but sometimes it takes longer. To test 
it, drop some in a siucer and set on ice; if it does not spread 
but remain rounded, it is done. 



Clayton s Quaker Cook-Book. 49 

Roman Punch. 

Take the juice of 4 oranges, and of the same number of 
lemons or Hmes. Dissolve 1 pound of white sugar in a pint of 
water. Mix all these together, and strain; after which add i 
pint of California champagne, and 2 gills of good California 
brandy, if desirable. Freeze the same as ice-cream.

Butter and Butter- Making. 

With the exception of bread, which has been appropriately 
termed " the staff of life," there is, perhaps, no other article of 
food more universally used by mankind than butter. Notwith- 
standing this well established fact, it is a lamentable reflection, 
that really good butter is one of the rarest and most difficult 
articles to be procured. Although the adulterations of this staple 
article of food are numerous, the main cause of the quantities of 
bad butter with which the community is burdened, is ignorance 
of the true methods, and slovenliness in the preparation of this 
staple article, for which no reasonable excuse can be urged. In 
the making of good butter, no process is more simple or easily 
accomplished. The Quakers, living in the vicinity of Philadel- 
phia, more than a century ago, so thoroughly understood and 
practised the art of making the best butter, that the products of 
their dairies sold readily in that city for from five to eight cents 
per pound more than that produced by any other class. 



50 Claytoris Quake?- Cook-Book. 

With these thrifty people, cleanliness was really regarded as 
" akin to godliness," and the principal was thoroughly and 
practically carried out in all their every day affairs. The most 
scrupulous attention being paid to the keeping of all the utensils 
used scrupulously clean, and so thoroughly w^ork the mass, that 
every particle of milk is expelled. The greatest evil to be 
guarded against, is the too free use of salt, which for this purpose 
should be of the utmost purity and refined quality. I am satis- 
fied, from personal observation, that the butter made at the 
Jersey Farm, at San Bruno, in the vicinity of San Francisco, in 
every respect equals in quality the celebrated Darlington, Phila- 
delphia. 

For the keeping milk fresh and sweet, and the proper set- 
ting of the rich cream, an old style spring-house is essentially 
requisite. Who thai has ever visited one of these clean, cool 
and inviting appendages of a well conducted farm and well 
ordered household, at some home-farm of the olden time, does 
not recall it in the mind's-eye, as vividly as did the poet Wood- 
worth when he penned that undying poem of ancient home-Ufe, 
" The Old Oaken Bucket that Hung in the Well." 

Properly constructed, a spring-house should be built of stone, 
which is regarded as the coolest — brick or concrete — with walls 
at least twelve inches in thickness. The floor should be of 
brick, and not more than two feet below the surface of the 
ground. The roof should be of some material best adapted to 
warding off the heat, and keeping the interior perfectly cool, 
while due attention should be paid to the allowance of a free 
circulation of air, and provision be made for thorough ventila- 
tion; only as much light as is actually necessary should be 
admitted, and where glass is used for this purpose, it should 



Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 51 

invariably be shielded from the sun. Walled trenches being 
constructed for this purpose, a constant stream of cool running 
water should pass around the pans containing the milk and 
cream, which, for the making of good butter, should never be 
permitted to become sour. The shelving and other furniture, 
and all wooden utensils used, should be of white ash, maple or 
white wood, in order to avoi<l all danger of communicating dis- 
tasteful or deleterious flavors. As there is no liquid more sen- 
sitive to its surroundings, or which more readily absorbs the 
flavor of articles coming in contact with it, than pure milk, 
everything that has a tendency to produce this deleterious result 
should be carefully excluded. Neither paints or varnish should 
be used about the structure, and the entire concern should be as 
utterly free from paint as the inside of an old time Quaker 
meeting-house. 

In making butter, the cream should be churned at a temper- 
ature of about 65 degrees. When the churning is finished, take 
up the lump and carefully work out every particle of milk. 
Never wash or put your hands in the mass. To each pound of 
butter work in a little less than an ounce of the purest dairy salt. 
Set the butter away, and at the proper time work the mass over 
until not a particle of milk remains. 



A Word of Advice to Hotel and Restaurant Cooks. 

I wish to say a word to the extensive brotherhood and an- 
cient and honorable guild constituting the Grand Army of 
Hotel and Restaurant Cooks distributed throughout our coun- 
try, on the all-important subject of making coffee and heating 
milk. Some satirical writer has sarcastically said that the way 



52 Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 

to make good coffee is to ascertain how tliat beverage is pre- 
pared in leading liotels and restaurants, and then make your 
coffee as they don't] There is no good reason why coffee can- 
not be as well made in hotel and restaurant kitchens, as in pri- 
vate families or anywhere else, if the berry is good, weil-browned, 
and pains are taken for the proper preparation of this popular 
beverage. 

Twenty years ago the art of making coffee in large quantities, 
and of properly heating milk for the same, was an unsolved 
problem — in fact, if not numbered among the many lost arts, 
might be classed as among the unknown in the culinary art. 
Twenty-one years ago, the late Mr. INIarden — a well-known 
citizen of San Francisco — and the author of this work— produced, 
as the result of long practical experience, a form for making a 
decoction of the ancient Arabian berry, which is now in gen- 
eral use throughout the entire Union. True, attempts have 
been made to improve upon the mode, which was the crown- 
ing triumph of the parties alluded to, but they have invariably 
proved failures, and to-day Marden & Clayton's coffee and milk 
urns stand pre-eminent in this important department of cook- 
ery. These urns are simply two capacious stone-ware jars, of 
equal capacity, and made precisely alike, with an orifice one inch 
from the bottom, in which a faucet is firmly cemented. Each 
jar is suspended in a heavy tin casing, affording an intervening 
space of two inches, which is to be filled with hot. but not boil- 
ing water, as a too high temperature would injure the flavor of 
the coffee, and detract from the aroma of the fragrant berry. 
Suspend a thin cotton sack in the centre, and half the height of 
the jar. After putting in this the desired amount of coffee, pour 
on it sufficient boiling water to make strong coffee. x'\s soon as 



Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 53 

the water has entirely filtered through, draw off the liquid 
through the stop-cock at the bottom of the jar,- and return it to 
the sack, passing it through, in the same manner, two or three 
times After five minutes raise the sack, pour in a cup of hot 
water, and let it filter through, getting, in this manner, every 
particle of the strength. Immediately after this remove the 
sack; for if it is left remaining but a short time, the aroma will 
be changed for the worse. Cover tightly, and keep the jar sur- 
rounded with hot, but not boiling water. Next, put into the 
milk urn — also surrounded with hot water — one-half the milk 
for the amount of coffee, and at the proper time add the re- 
maining half of the milk, having it, in this manner, fresh, and 
not over-cooked. Should the milk become too hot, pour in a 
cup of cold milk, stirring well at the same lime. 

The first of these urns for making coffee and heating milk, 
were those used for the purpose at the opening of the Occi- 
dental Hotel of this city — of which Mr. Piper was at that time 
the intelligent and experienced head-cook. This mode of 
making coffee in large quantities is still followed at this hotel, 
which, from the time of its opening to the present, has main- 
tained the reputation as one of the best of the numerous excel- 
lent public houses of this city, and the entire Union. 

Clayton's California Golden Coffee. 

Let the coffee — which should be nicely browned, but not 
burned — be ground rather fine, in order that you may extract 
the strength without boiling — as that dissipates the aroma and 
destroys the flavor. Put the coffee in a thin muslin sack — 
reaching less than half-way to the bottom of the vessel — then 
})lace it in the pot, and pour over enough boiling water to make 



54 Clay ions Quaker Cock- Bock. 

strong coffee. Let it stand on the hot range two or three min- 
utes, when Hft out the sack, pour the hquid in a vessel, and re- 
turn it tt^rough the sack the second time, after which, raising 
the sack again, pour through a httle hot water to extract all the 
strength from the grounds. Next, pour into the liquid, cold, 
Jersey Dairy, or any other pure country milk, until the coffee 
assumes a rich golden color, and after it reaches a boiling-heat 
once more, set it back. Should the milk be boiled separately, 
the richness, combined with its albumen, will be confined to 
the top; whereas, if added cold, and boiled with the coffee, it 
will be thoroughly incorporated with the liquid, adding mate- 
rially to its rich flavor and delicate aroma. 

[Never substitute a woolen for the muslin strainer, as that 
fabric, being animal should never come in contact with heat; 
while cotton or linen, being of vegetable fibre, is easily washed 
clean and dried. Neither should tin be used, as that lets the 
fine coffee through, and clouds the liquid, which should be 
clear. To extract its full strength, coffee should invariably be 
ground as fine as oatmeal or finely-ground hominy, and pro- 
tracted boiling dissipates the aroma and destroys its fine flavor.] 



The Very Best Way to Make Chocolate. 

After grating through a coarse grater, put the chocolate in a 
stew-pan with a coffee-cup or more of hot water; let it boil up 
two or three minutes, and add plenty of good rich country 
milk to make it of the right consistency, Too much water 
tends to make this otherwise delightful beverage insipid. 

[Good Cocoa is made in the same manner.] 



Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 55 

Old Virginia Egg-Nog. 

Two dozen fresh eggs; i gallon rich milk; i^ pounds pow- 
dered sugar; 2 pints cognac brandy, or Santa Cruz rum — or ^ 
pint cognac and \ pini Jamaica, or Santa Cruz rum. Break the 
eggs carefully, separating the whites from the yolks; add the 
sugar to the latter, and with a strong spoon beat until very 
light, adding gradually 2 dessert spoonfuls of powdered mace or 
nutmeg. Next, add the liquor, pouring in slowly, stirring actively 
at the same time; after which add the milk in like manner. 
Meanwhile — having whipped the whites of the eggs with an egg- 
beater into a light froth — pour tiie egg-nog into a bowl, add 
the white froth, and decorate with crimson sugar or nutmeg, 
and serve. The foregoing proportions will be sufficient to make 
fourteen pints of very superior egg-nog. 

Clayton's Popular Sandwich Paste. 

Take 2 pounds VVhittaker's Star ham, in small pieces — f lean 
and \ fat — the hock portion of the ham is best for this purpose. 
Have ready two fresh calves tongues, boiled and skinned nicely, 
and cut like the ham. Put these in a kettle, along with 2 good- 
sized onions, and cover with cold water, boiling slowly until 
quite tender; when add i pound of either fresh or canned 
tomatoes, stirring for half-an-hour, adding a little hot water, if 
in danger of burning. Add to the mixture, at the same time, 
these spices: plenty of best mustard, and a little ground cloves, 
along with Worcestershire or Challenge sauce, allowing the 
mixture to simmer five minutes. When cool enough, pour 
into a wooden bowl, and after chopping fine, pound the mix- 
ture well, while it is warm, with a potato-masher. After the 



56 Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 

mass has cooled it will spread like butter. Should additional 
seasoning be desired, it can be worked in at any desired time. 
If not rich enough to suit some palates, one-fourth of a pound 
best butter may be worked in. 

The bread used for the sandwiches must be quite cold and 
perfectly fresh — cutting carefully in thin slices — using for this 
purpose a long, thin-bladed and quite sharp knife. Take a 
thin shaving from the bottom of the loaf, then from the top an 
inch-wide slice, after removing the crust. Care must be taken 
to cut without either tearing or pressing the bread. Spread on 
one side of each slice — as if using butter — and after joining the 
slices, cut the same to suit the taste. 

[As the best bread is the only kind to be used in making 
sandwiches — without wishing to make invidious distinctions — 
I must say that Engleberg furnishes from his bakery (on Kear- 
ney street), the best I have ever used for this purpose, as it cuts 
without breaking, and does not dry so soon as other breads I 
have made use of.] 

Welsh Rabbit. 

To prepare Welsh rabbit, or rare-bit — both names being used 
to designate this popular and appetizing dish, which has ever 
been a favorite with gourmands and good livers, both ancient 
and modern — take one-half pound of best cheese — not, how- 
ever, over nine months old — Davidson's, Gilroy, California, or 
White's, Herkimer County, New York, and cut in small pieces. 
Put over a slow fire, in a porcelain-lined kettle; when it begins 
to melt pour m three tablespoonfuls rich milk or cream, and 
a little good mustard. Stir from the time the cheese begins to 
melt, to prevent scorching. Have ready a quite hot dish; cover 



Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 57 

the bottom with toast, buttered upon both sides, upon which 
pour the melted cheese, spieadinj^ evenly over. If you ])refer, 
you may use as a condiment a little mustard, pepper, or any 
favorite sauce. This is a dish that must be eaten as soon as 
taken from the fire. 

Delicate Waffles. 

Take \ pound butter; \ pound fine su^ar; 9 eggs; 3 pints of 
milk; \\ ounces of best baking powder, and 2\ pounds sifted 
flour. Beat the butter and sugar to a cream ; add the yolks of 
the eggs, the milk, and half the flour; mix well, with the whiles 
of the eggs, beaten to a staunch snow, and add the remainder 
of the flour. Bake in waffle irons, well greased and heated. 
When baked, the tops may be dusted well with fine sugar, or 
with a mixture of sugar and powdered cinnamon. 

Force-Meat Balls. 

Mix, with I pound of chopped veal, or other meat, 1 ^%%, a 
little butter, i cup, or less, of bread crumbs — moistening the 
whole with milk or the juice of the stewed meat. Season with 
summer savory. Make into small balls, and fry brown. 

Beef-Tea. 

Take 3 pounds of lean beef; chop as fine as coarse hominy, 
and put in a vessel, covering the meat with cold water. Cover 
the vessel tightly, and let boil for four hours, carefully keeping 
the beef just covered with the water. Pass through a colander, 
pressing out all the juice with a potato-masher, strain through a 
cotton cloth, and add a little salt. A glass of sherry wine deci- 
dedly improves beef-tea. 



58 Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 

Crab Sandwich. 

Put J pound boiled crab meat in a mortar, and pound to a 
smooth paste, adding ihe juice of a lemon. Season with pepper 
and salt, with a pinch of curry powder, and mix the paste well 
with 6 ounces best butter. Cut slices of bread rather thin, trim 
off the crust, and spread. 

Something about Pork.— The Kind to Select, and 
Best Mode of Curing. 

The best quality of poik. as a matter of course, is that 
fed and slaughtered in the country. Corn, or any kind of 
grain-fed, or, more especially, milk-fed poik, as every one 
knows, who is not of the Hebrew faith, which entirely ignores 
this — when properly prepared, well-flavored, oleaginous pro- 
ducuon — and is fond of pork, from the succulent sucking pig, 
the toothsome and fresh spare-rib, unrivalled as a broil, to the 
broiled or boiled ham, and side-meat bacon of the full-grown 
porker, is vastly superior to the meat of the slop and garbage-fed 
animal raised and slaughtered in the city — more especially as 
the butchering of hogs in San Francisco is at this time entirely 
monopolized by the Chinese population, who seem to have a 
warm side, in fact a most devoted affection, for the hog, sur- 
passing even that of the bog-trotters of the " Ould Sod " for the 
traditional pet-pig that " ates, drinks and slapes wid the ould 
man, the ould woman, and the childer." Charles Lamb's ac- 
count of the discovery of the delights of roast pig, and inven- 
tion of that luxury by the Chinaman whose bamboo hut was 
burned down, in raking his pig, serai-cremated from the ashes, 
burned his fingers— which, naturally clapping into his mouth to 
ease the pain — which was changed to delight, causing John's 



Clavhns Quaker Cook-Book. 59 

torture-smilten visage to assume in an instant a broad grin of 
satisfaction at the discovery — is undoubtedly correct, or at least 
the love for the pork exhibited bv the " Heathen Chinee" can- 
not reasonably be accounted for in any other way. In order, 
then, to gel the best article of pork — wholesome, toothsome, 
and, what is most important of all, entirely free from any form of 
disease or taint, great care should be taken to make selections 
from the small lots fed and slaughtered in the country, and 
brought into the city most generally in the fall season, and which 
are to be procured at the stall or shoj) of any reputable and re- 
liable dealer. Select a carcass of one hundred, or less, pounds, 
with flesh hard and white, and thin skin. For salting, cut in 
pieces six by eight inches, and, after having rubbed thoroughly 
in salt— neither too fine nor too coarse — take a half- barrel, 
sprinkle the bottom well with salt, and lay the pieces of pork in 
tightly; then add salt, and follow with another layer of pork, 
until the whole is packed, with salt sprinkled on top. Set in a 
cool place, and, after three or four days, make a brine of boil- 
ing water with salt — which, when cool, should be sufficiently 
strong to float an Q^g — stir in a half pound of brown sugar, 
pour over the meat sufficient to cover, and place on top a stone 
heavy enough to keep the pork weighted down. 

Home-Made Lard. 

Home-made lard is undoubtedly the best as well as cheapest. 
If leaf is not to be had, take 10 lbs of solid white pork, as fat as 
possible, which is quite as good, if not better; cut in pieces uni- 
formly the size of your finger, and put in a vessel with a thick 
bottom — one of iron is preferable — and adding i pint of water, 
put on the range; keep tightly covered until the water has evap- 



6o Clayton s Quaker Cook-Book. 

orated in steam, when leave off the cover, letting it cook slowly, 
until the scraps turn a light brown, when take off, and while still 
quite warm, strain through a colander, pressing the scraps hard 
with a potato-masher; pour the liquid into cans and set away. 
The next day it will be found snow-white, solid and of a fine 
and equal consistence; and for cooking purposes, quite as good 
as fresh churned butter in making biscuits, any kind of pastry, 
or frying eggs. 

[In trying lard keep a c ireful watch and see that it does not 
scorch.] 

New Jersey Sausage. 

Take the very best pork you can get — one-third fat and two- 
thirds lean — and chop on a block with a kitchen cleaver. 
When half chopped, season with black pepper, salt and sage, 
rubbed through a sieve, and then finish the chopping; but do 
not cut the meat too fine, as in that case the juice of the 
meat will be lost. Make the mixture up into patties, and fry on 
a common pan, placed in the oven of the stove, taking care not 
to cook them hard. Veal is a good substitute for the lean pork 
in making these sausages, which are much better if made one 
day before cooking, 

Pot-Pie. 

The following I have found the best manner of making any 
kind of pot-pie. White meat, such as chicken, quail or nice 
veal, is decidedly the best for the purpose. Stew the meat until 
tender, in considerable liquid as when you put into the paste 
much of that will be absorbed. In making the paste take i quart 
of flour and 2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder, rubbed well into 
the flour, \ pound butter or sweet lard, and a little salt; mix 



Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 6i 

with milk or water into a soft dough; roll \ an inch thick; cut 
to size, and lay in a steamer for 15 minutes to make light, then 
put in and around the stew; cooking slowly for ten minutes. 

Curried Crab. 

Put into a saucepan \ pound butter with a little flour; cook 
together and stir till cool; then add a gill of cream, a little 
cayenne pepper, salt, and a dessert-spoonful of East India Curry 
Powder. Mix well together, and add i pound boiled crab meat, 
chopped fine ; stir well together — make very hot and serve. The 
addition of a glass of white wine adds to the flavor of this curry. 

To Toast Bread. 

Cut bread in slices \ an inch thick; first taking a thin crust 
from top, bottom and sides, or shave the loaf before cutting — 
otherwise the crust will scorch before the soft part is sufficiently 
toasted. 

Cream Toast. 

To make a delicious cream toast, mix well a teaspoonful 
of corn-starch with a little cold milk, and put in a stewpan with 
a piece of butter the size of an ^^%. Pour in hot milk, and 
stir two minutes, adding a little salt — a litde sugar is also an 
improvement — and pour over the toast while hot. 

Fritters. 

Four eggs, well beaten; i quart of milk; i quart of flour; 2 
teaspoonfuls baking powder; one tablespoonful sugar, and a 
little salt. Cook in best lard, and serve with hard or liquid 
sauce, highly flavored with California brandy or white wine. 



62 Claytons Quaker Cock-Book. 

Hash. 

Il is a mistaken idea (labored under by many), that hash can 
be made of waste material, that would otherwise be thrown 
away. This is a most excellent and palatable dish if properly 
prepared. Take the shank, or other parts of good beef you 
may have at hand, and boil, with as little water as possible, 
until quite tender, and let stand until quite cold. Then take 
of potatoes, that have been peeled before boiling, one-third the 
amount of the meat used, and chop moderately fine, adding 
plenty of pepper and salt, to taste. Next, chop two or three 
onions fine, and stew them in some of the liquid in which the 
meat was boiled, dredging in a little flour, and when thoroughly 
done, put in the hash, and chop and mix thoroughly. If you 
think the mass requires moistening add a little of the fat and 
juice. Put the whole in a pan, and bake in a quick oven until 
slightly browned at top and bottom. 

Should you have good corned-beef — not loo salt — it is very 
nice made in this manner. Use the marrow from the bones in 
making hash. 

Hashed Potatoes with Eggs. 

Chop fine 8 or lo cold boiled potatoes; heat a pan (east-iron 
is preferable,) quite hot; put in butter the size of an t^^, and as 
soon as melted add the potatoes; salt and pepper; slightly stir- 
ring frequently, and, when heated thoroughly, stir in four well- 
beaten eggs. Serve on a hot dish. 

Baked Macaroni. 

Break the macaroni rather short; wash and put in salted 
water; boil about twenty minutes. Drain off the water, replace 
it with a cup of good milk and i tablespoonful of best butter, 



Clo) ion's Quaker Cook- Book. 63 

and as soon as boiling hot put in a baking-dish. If you like 

cheese, grate over it the best California article — old cheese 

s;iould never be used — and bake to a light brown. 

For stewed macaroni omit the baking and the cheese, if you 

like. 

Drawn-Butter. 

To make drawn-buiter, take two tablespoonfuls of flour; 

good butler, the size of an egg; a little milk, and make to a 

smooth paste. Then work in slowly one-half pint of water, 

until the flour is cooked. Season to taste. The foregoing 

will be found a good basis for nearly all hot sauces, for fish, 

beet, and other vegetables, as well as for puddings. 

Spiced Currants. 

Two boxes of currants, washed and stemmed; 3 pounds 
sugar, I tablespoonful allsi)ice, i lablespoonful of cloves, i table- 
spoonful cinnamon; boil half-an-hour. 

The Best Method of Canning Fruits. 
There are various modes of canning fruits, almost every house- 
keeper having a method of her own. For the benefit of those 
who are at loss in this particular, we give the following mode — 
which we fully endorse as the best within our knowledge — 
made use of by Mrs. George W. Ladd, of Bradford, Massachu- 
setts, whose fruits, prepared in this way, have respeatedly taken 
the first premium at the Agricultural Fair, held in the Old Bay 
State. This lady certainly deserves the thanks of all interested 
in this important matter, for her liberality in giving the pubhc 
the benefit of her knowledge and experience in this line, as 
detailed in the following, published in the New Fork Graphic 
of August 15, 1883: 



64 Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 

" As the season of ripe fruit advances, I prepare such quanti- 
ties of syrup as I think I may need, in this way: Three pounds 
of granulated sugar to one gallon of water and boil twenty min- 
utes; this I put in glass jars, when cool, and set away for future 
use. Peaches, quinces, pears, apples, plums, pine apples, rhu- 
barb, crab apples, and, in fact, all fruits of this kind, I peel, 
quarter and place in a dish of cold water (to prevent discolora- 
tion), until I have prepared enough to fill ajar: I then pack 
them solid as possible in a jar, and then fill the jar with the 
syrup previously prepared. I then place a wire stand in the 
bottom of my preserving kettle, on which to place the jar, then 
fill the kettle with cold water until the jar is two-thirds covered; 
leave the jar open, but cover the kettle and boil until the fruit 
is sufficiently soft; have ready a little boiling syrup, if needed, to 
fill the jar full to overflowing. Then place the rubber band 
around the neck of the jar and screw the cover on as tightly as 
possible; then in from three to five minutes give the cover 
another turn, in order to be sure it is air tight, and you will 
have no mortal trouble with it. I use Mason's jars with metal- 
lic porcelain covers." 

Preparing Quinces for Canning or Preserving. 

Quinces for canning or preserving should be kept in a dry 
place for thirty days after taking from the trees, in order to give 
them richness and flavor. Peel and cut to the proper size, 
carefully saving skins and cores. Put the last named in a por- 
celain kettle and boil until quite tender, when strain through a 
cotton-bag; afterwards put the juice back in the kettle, and add 
sugar as directed in the directions for canning fruit. Boil slowly 
for half-an-hour, taking off the scum as it rises, then set away to 
cool, and can the fruit as directed in the receipt for canning.

Clayton's Monmouth Sauce. 

In inakini^ this delightful ketchup, take 25 pounds of fresh, or 
iwo S 11). cans of tomatoes, and slice, not too thin, adding five 
medium sized onions cut fine. Put these, with plenty of salt, in 
a porcelain kettle; adding, with a handful of hot green peppers, 
or a less quantity, if dried, i ounce of white ginger, chopped fine, 
I ounce of iiorse-radish, and \ ounce each of ground cloves and 
allspice, and i lemon, with seeds removed and cut small. After 
letting these boil for three hours, work through a sieve and 
return to the kettle along with a pint of wine vinegar, 2 table- 
spoonfuls sugar, 2 of good mustard, a teacupful of Challenge or 
Worcestershire Sauce, and let boil for 2 or 3 minutes, and set 
off. To prevent fermentation, stir in a teacupful of high-proof 
California brandy. If too thick, when cold reduce with vinegar. 

To Prepare Mustard for the Table. 

Take \ i)Ound best mustard and enough wine vinegar, mixed 
with \ boiling water, i large teaspoonful of salt, i teaspoonful of 
sugar, juice of half a lemon, and mix to a thin batter, and put 
in a common glass jar and keep stopped tight. If pure mus- 
tard is used, treated in this way, it will keep good for months. 

[If you desire the best article of mustard, I think E. R. 
Durkee cl' Co's is the best I have ever used, although Colman's 
ranks equally high, if you can get the genuine unadulterated 
article, which can be had by procuring Crosse & Blackwell's 
London brand, for which Messrs. Richards and Harrison are 
the San P'rancisco agents.] 

Mint Sauce. 

Into a teacupful of hot vinegar, in which has been dissolved 
suflicient sugar to make slightly sweet, add a handful of mint 
cho])i>ed quite fine. Serve hot.

Eggs Ought Never be Poached. 

Poached eggs are always tasteless, and also unhealthy, owing 
to the albumen going into the water into which they are drop- 
ped, giving it a white and milky appearance — taking away a 
portion of the richness which should remain in the t%g, render- 
ing it indigestible, and of course, unwholesome. 

Sunnyside Roast. 

Select a good, tender piece either of beef or mutton — veal and 
pork can also be nicely roasted in the same way — place in your 
iron saucepan or pot one tablespoonful of good lard or half as 
much butter, and an onion, cut fine; let your onion fry to a light 
brown, and put in your meat, first having washed, dried and 
salted it. Put the cover on and let stand until it is pretty well 
browned; then add water, unless in danger of burning. Add 
only enough water, from time to time, to keep it from burning; 
turn it frequently so that it may brown on all sides. When ten- 
der, it will come forth brown and juicy. Just before serving, see 
that there is enough water for gravy; if there is not, you can 
take out the meat and add enough, but not too much, hot water, 
and then pour it over the meat. 

Clayton's Spanish Omelette. 

Chop into dice \ pound of breakfast bacon, a small tomato, 
4 mushrooms, mince very fine a small onion; add pepper to 
taste, put in a frying pan and cook slowly until the lean is done; 
take off and put in a warm place to keep hot. This is sufficient 
for 6 eggs. 



Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 67 

Plain Omelette. 

Beat the yolks and white of 8 eggs separately until light, then 
beat together; add a little salt and 1 tablespoonful cream. Have 
in the pan a piece of butter, and when boiling hot pour^ in the 
omelette and shake until it begins to stiffen; then letjt brown. 
Fold double and serve hot. 

Clam Fritters. 
Sift into an earthen dish 3 spoonfuls flour and \ teaspoonful 
baking powder; add to this a little of the clam juice, \ a cup of 
cream and 2 eggs, well beaten. Mince a pint of clams and mix 
with the batter. Put 2 or 3 spoonfuls of lard into a frying-pan, 
and when boiling, drop in the batter, by spoonfuls, to fry; after 
frjnng a minute, take from the pan, drain and serve. 

Fried Tripe. 

If the tripe is boiled tender, cut in pieces 2 inches square, 
season with salt and pepper and dip in a batter made of eggs, 
milk and flour, and fry in sweet lard, or drippings from roast or 
corned beef. 

Ringed Potatoes. 

Peel large potatoes, cut them round and round as you would 
pare an apple; fry in the best lard until a light brown; sprinkle 
with salt and serve hot. 

New Potatoes Boiled. 

Wash and rub new potatoes with a coarse towel, drop in boil- 
ing water, and boil until done, taking care that they are not 
over boiled. Have ready, in a saucepan, some milk or cream 



68 Clayton's Quaker Cook-Book. 

with butter, a little chopped parsley, pepper and salt; drain ilie 
potatoes, add them to the cream with a teaspoonful of corn- 
starch, soaked in a little milk; let it come to a simmer, and 
serve at once. 

Fried Tomatoes. 

Take large smooth tomatoes, cut them in slices ^ an inch 
thick, dip in bread crumbs or cracker dust and fry a Ii2:ht brown, 
in half lard and half butter. 

Squash and Corn. — Spanish Style. 

Take 3 small summer squashes and 3 ears of corn; chop the 
squashes and cut the corn from the cobs. Put into a saucej)an 
a spoonful of lard or butter, and when very hot an onion; fry a 
little; add the corn and squash, i tomatoe and i green pepjier, 
cut small, and salt to taste. Cover closely and stir frequently to 
prevent scorching. 

Pickles. 

To make mixed pickles, cut small cucumbers crosswise in 
about 4 pieces; onions, if not very small, in 2, and peppers, if 
the ordinary size, in 4 pieces. Should you have green toma- 
toes, cut them small. Use a less amount of onions and ])e])]>ers 
than cucumbers; mix all together with a few bay leaves. Next, 
take a tub or keg, and, having covered the bottom with fine salt, 
put on a layer of pickles, adding alternate layers of each, leav- 
ing that of salt on top. Cover with a cotton cloth, and lay on 
a stone or wooden weight. Let them remain three days; then 
take out, rinse in cold water, but do not soak, and put them in 
a basket or sack to drain for twelve hours. Have ready plenty 
of California wine vinegar, made hot, but not boiling, adding 



Clayton's Quaker Cook-Book. 69 

the following — cloves, allspice, green ginger, and whole mus- 
tard seed, with i coffee-cup sugar. When the vinegar is at 
scalding heat pour over the pickles and cover. 

Nice Picklette. 

Take 4 nice cabbages, chopped fine; i quart onions, chopped 
fine; 2 quarts— or sufficient to cover the mixture — best wine 
vinegar, adding two tablespoonfuls each of ground mustard, 
black pepper, cinnamon, celery salt, i of mace, and i coffee- 
cup sugar. Pack the cabbages and onions in alternate layers, 
with a little fine salt between, and let stand until next day; then 
scald the vinegar with the spices and sugar, and pour over the 
cabbages and onions. Repeat this the next day; and on the 
third, heat the whole scalding hot, let it cool, and put in jars, 
when it is fit for use at once- 
Pickled Tripe. 

Pickled tripe is very nice — and that sold by John Bayle, in 
the California Market, which is cleaned by steam process, and 
is quite tender and unsalted is a superior article. To prepare 
for pickling, cut in pieces about four inches square, say five or 
six pounds. Put into a kettle; cover with boiling water, add- 
ing a handful of salt; let stand fifteen minutes; take out and 
drain, keeping warm. Mix one-fourth water with the best wine 
vinegar — to which add cloves, allspice and mace, with i teacup- 
ful sugar; heat, and pour over the tripe, and set away to cool. 
Tripe prepared in this way is the best for broiling or frying. 

To Cook Grouse or Prairie Chicken. 

The best way I have found for cooking this delicious game 
bird is, first, after cleaning, to cut off the wings and legs, as. 



70 Clayiotis Quaker Cook- Book. 

with the back, these parts are of little account; next, split the 
birds in the centre, taking out the breast-bone, and you have 
two heavy pieces; if the bird is large, divide again; do not wash, 
but wipe with a damp cloth. Season with pepper and salt, and 
broil with butter quite rare; then lay in a porcelain-lined pan, 
with butter and currant or grape jelly, adding a litde cayenne 
pepper, and a small quantity of port or white wine. 
[Venison steak may be cooked in the same manner.] 

Brains and Sweet- Breads. 

When properly prepared the brains of calves and sheep form 
a very inviting dish. Lay fresh brains in cold, salted water for 
fifteen minutes; then put them in boiling water, and parboil for 
ten minutes. After cleaning off the outer membrane — for fry- 
ing — split them, and season with salt and pepper, and run them 
through ^%%, beaten with a little milk; roll them in cracker- 
dust, and fry to a light brown in equal parts of sweet lard and 
butter. 

For stewed brains, cut half the size for frying and put in a 
stewpan, with a lump of butter, pepper and salt, a little water 
or soup-stock, and one-half an onion, chopped fine and stewed 
tender. Add this, and cook slowly for a few minutes, when 
put in two or three spoonfuls of milk or cream, and a little 
white wine or juice of lemon. 

[Sweet-breads may be cooked in the same manner.] 

Stewed Spare -Ribs of Pork. 

Cut the ribs in pieces of a finger's length and the width of 
two fingers. Put in the kettle with two onions, salt and pep- 
per, and cover with cold water. Let them stew slowly for two 



Clayton* s Quaker Cook- Book. 71 

hours, and then put in 3 potatoes, 2 purple-top turnips, 
which have been peeled and cut, and left in cold water at least 
two hours; also add two tomatoes. This stew must have plenty 
of gravy, which can be made by working a little flour and but- 
ter with a few spoonfuls of rich milk, cooking five minutes. 

[An Irish stew may be made in the foregoing manner by 
substituting ribs of mutton.] 

Broiled Oysters. 
In order to broil oysters properly, take those of the largest size, 
drain, and dry in a cloth, and lay carefully on a nice wire grid- 
iron that will hold them tight; sprinkle slightly with salt and 
pepper, and put them over a good clear fire for a short time, 
and turn, taking care not to broil too much; serve with the best 
butter on a hot dish. 

Pumpkin or Squash Custard. 

Take enough pumpkin or squash to make i quart when 
cooked; and after it is boiled or steamed, rub through a sieve, 
and work in 3 eggs well beaten, with rich milk sufficient to 
make the proper consistence, adding sugar to taste; season with 
ginger and allspice, and bake in cups or dishes to a nice brown. 
May be eaten hot, but is better cold. 

Fig Pudding. 

Take i pint grated bread crumbs, i cup suet, i cup brown 
sugar, 2 eggs and \ pound of fresh figs. Wash the figs in warm 
water, and dry in a cloth; chop the suet and figs together, and 
add the other ingredients, also i nutmeg, grated. Put in a 
mould or floured bag, and boil 3 hours. Serve with hard sauce. 



72 Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 

Fried Apples. 

Take 6 good cooking apples, cut in slices \ of an inch thick ; 
have a pan of fresh hot lard ready, drop the slices in and fry 
brown; sprinkle a little sugar over them and serve hot. 

Clayton's Oyster Stew. 

In my long experience I have found that ihe best way to stew 
oysters, is, after having saved all the juice of the oysters, lo put 
it in a stew pan with a little boiling water, and a good lump of 
butter worked in a little flour, adding pepper and salt. Let 
these boil for two minutes, or long enough to cook the flour; 
then put in the oysters, and the moment the stew boils up again 
add a little sweet cream or country milk, and when it boils the 
stew is cooked and should be set away from a hot fire. Cooked 
in this way, good oysters will never be tough and tasteless as is 
too often the case.| 

Boiled Celery. 

Cut the white stalks of celery the length of asparagus, boil in 
as little salted water as possible until quite tender. The 
root, cut in slices, is equally good. Dress with drawn butter 
made with the water in which the celery was boiled. This 
vegetable is said to be a sedative and antidote to nervous 
debility. 

Selecting Meats. 

For a roast of beef, select from the ribs nearest the point of 
the shoulder-blade, running backward. For steaks, choose that 
with the diamond bone on either side. For chops of mutton or 
lamb, select the rib. For roasting, choose the loin or saddle; 



Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book 73 

and for boiling, the leg of mutton — but not of lamb, the latter 
being best roasted. For corned-beef, select parts commonly 
known as the navel and plate pieces, and next best to these, 
the brisket and rounds. 

/ 
Rebecca Jackson's Rice Pudding. 

Take i quart of rich milk; J of a coffee -cup of rice, well 
washed, and a lump of butter the size of an egg, and i nutmeg. 
This pudding must be made quite sweet, and without eggs. 
Bake three hours in a moderate oven, stirring occasionally the 
first hour. Bake until the top is a dark brown. To be eaten 
cold. 

[This pudding — which was a common dish in the last cen- 
tury — was generally baked on Saturday for Sunday's dessert.] 

Bread-and-Butter Pudding. 

To I quart of milk, add 3 or 4 eggs, well beaten, with sugar 
enough to make rather sweet, and season with nutmeg or cin- 
namon Put in a baking-pan and cover with slices of nice 
bread, buttered on both sides. Bake until the bread is nicely 
browned, taking care, however, not to bake too much, which 
would make it watery. Good either hot or cold. 

Codfish Cakes. 

Pick boiled codfish in small biis, adding equal quantities of 
mashed potato and fish, with two eggs, well beaten, seasoning 
with black pepper, and roll in a little flour, the shape of a 
small cake. Fry in sweet lard, or nice drippings, to a nice 
brown, but not hard. 



74 Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 

Pickled Grapes. 

Remove from ripe grapes all imperfect and broken berries; 
line an earthen jar with grape leaves and fill with grapes. To 
2 quarts vinegar add i pint white sugar, \ ounce ground ^-in- 
namon, and \ ounce cloves. Let vinegar and spices boil five 
minutes; then add the sugar, and, when moderately cool, pour 
over the grapes. 

Forced Tomatoes. 

Peel and slice some large- sized tomatoes, and put in a colan- 
der to drain. Cut in small pieces i pint of mushrooms, adding 
some minced parsley, a slice of finely chopped ham, some 
summer savory, thyme, salt, and cayenne pepper. Put all these 
in a saucepan with some butter, and \ cup of water. Boil 
together ten or fifteen minutes, and set away to cool. Have 
ready some fine bread crumbs, add to them seasoning, and the 
yolks of 2 or 3 well-beaten eggs. Mix the mushrooms and 
tomatoes, together; pour into a baking-dish a portion of it; 
then sprinkle over it a layer of the bread-crumbs and add the 
remainder of the tomatoes; cover with bread-crumbs, and put 
some bits of butter on top. Hake half-an-hour in a well heated 

oven. 

Broiled Flounders or Smelts. 

Have medium-sized flounders or smelts, cleaned with as little 
cutting as possible; wash thoroughly in salted water, and dry on 
a towel; mix in a saucer three tablespoonfuls of olive oil, and 
I of vinegar, with salt and pepper; score the sides of the fish at 
intervals of an inch, with a sharp knife, and rub all over with 
the mixture of oil, vinegar and seasoning. Place them be- 
tween the bars of a buttered gridiron, and broil a light brown 
over a moderate fire. 



Claytons Quaker Cook- Book. 75 

Onions. 

There is no more healthy vegetable or article of diet in gen- 
eral use than onions. Taken regularly, they greatly promote 
the health of the lungs and digestive organs. Used in a cooked 
— either fried, roasted or boiled — or in a raw state, their vir- 
tues are marked and beneficial. They are among the most 
popular of old-lime remedies for colds, having the advantage 
of always being readily procured, and it is said that affections of 
the lungs and liver have been largely benefitted, and even 
cured, by a free use of this palatable esculent. They are also 
resorted to as a sedative and remedy for sleeplessness. 

Singeing Fowls. 

The best mode I have ever followed for singeing fowls, is to 
put 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of alcohol in a tin dish and light with 
a match, thus making a large flame, without smoke— that is apt 
to injure the flavor of the bird. 



The Secret of Tests of Taste and Flavor, 

The correct test of coffee or tea, is to make use of a thin 
china or delf-ware cup, by which the lips are brought close 
together, while a thicker cup would separate them widely apart. 
In testing the quality and flavor of wines, the thinnest quality 
of glass is for the same reason essentially requisite. Our grand- 
mothers, who lived a hundred years ago, understood the phil- 
osophy of this when they expressed the opinion, that it was only 
possible to get the true taste, fine flavor, and delicate aroma of 
tea, by drinking it out of a china cup. 



76 Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 

How to Choose Ware for Ranges. 

In selecting ware for a range, especial care should be taken 
to see that the bottoms of all the cooking utensils are perfectly 
level, for if convex, they will invariably burn in the centre. An 
iron grating or grid-iron — \ of an inch in depth — placed 
between the pan and the top of the range, will be found highly 
useful while cooking, as this increases the heat and lessens the 
liability of burning. 

Drying Herbs for Seasoning. 

All herbs should be gathered just before blossoming and dried 
in the shade, or in a dark dry room, as exposure to the sun both 
takes away flavor and color When perfectly dry, put in a clean 
sack and hang in a dry room or loft, and when wanted for use, 
rub through a sieve. Herbs treated in this way, if left dry, will 
retain their strength and remain perfectly good for years. As 
long as the outer membrane of the leaves remains unbroken, the 
aroma cannot escape. 

To Destroy Roaches, Flies and Ants. 

Take 1 5 cents worth of powdered borax and a small bottle of 
Persian Insect Powder, and mix thoroughly together. In order 
to use successfully, take a feather from the wing of a turkey or 
goose, by the quill, and dipping the feather end in the powder, 
spring the feather as a bow ; in this way you can thoroughly rid 
the room of flies. Before using on roaches, set the doors wide 
open, as they will start for the open air; generally, however, 
dying on the way To rid cupboards or closets of ants, sprinkle 
wherever these minute pests "most do congregate." An easy 
and cheap remedy to rid pantries of cock-roaches is said to be 



Clavtons Quaker Cook-Book, 77 

fresh cucumber pairings laid in their haunts. We have never 
tested this remedy, but can vouch for the efficacy of the above 
mentioned compound. 

To Clean Tin- Ware. 

The best thing for cleaning tin ware is common soda; 
datnpen a cloth, dip it in the soda, rub the ware briskly, after 

which wipe dry. 

Iron Rust. 

Iron rust may be removed by a little salt mixed with lemon - 
juice; put in the sun, and if necessary use two applications. 

Mildew. 

An old time and effectual remedy for mildew is to dip the 
stained cloth in buttermilk and lay in the sun. 

Oysters Roasted on Chafing-Dish. 

Take largest oysters, and put in a chafing-dish in their own 
liquor. Season with red or black pepper, adding plenty of 
good butter, with a little Worcestershire sauce or walnut catsup. 
After roasting — taking care not to roast too much — serve on 
buttered toast. 

Codfish, Family Style. 

After the fish has been soaked twelve hours, boil slowly for 
twenty-five or thirty minutes, or until it will break up nicely. 
Then pick all the bones out, but do not pick the fish too fine. 
Have ready three hard-boiled eggs; rub the yolks in plenty of 
good butter; put into the kettle enough milk to heat the fish; 
when hot stir in the butter, with the fish. At the same time 
have potatoes peeled and boiled. Cut, not too small, with the 
whites of the eggs cut small; season with pepper. Serve H©t 
with buttered toast at the bottom of the dish. 



78 Clayioris Quaker Cook-Book. 

Codfish in Philadelphia Style. 

After soaking and boiling the fish, break up small, and pick- 
ing out all the bones, have ready potatoes, peeled and boiled, 
equal to the amount of fish. Put them in a wooden bowl or 
tray. Pound or mash well with a potato masher. Work to 
soft dough, with butter and well- beaten eggs, and milk or cream. 
Season with pepper and salt, if salt is required. Put it in a dish 
suitable to set on the table, and bake a few minutes, or until 
light brown. 



She I^ai^ting r?oui^. 



There's something in the parting hour 

Will chill the warmest heart, 
Yet kindred, comrades, lovers, friends, 

Are fated all to part. 
But, this I've seen, and many a pang has pressed it on my mind, 
The one who goes is happier than those he leaves behind. 

No matter what the journey be, 

Adventurous, dangerous, far; 
To the wild bleak or deep frontier. 

To solitude or war; 
Still fortune cheers the heart that dares, in all of human kiml, 
And those who go are happier than those they leave behind. 

The bride goes to the bridegroom's home 

With doublings and with tears. 
But, does not Hope her rainbow spread 

Across her cloudy fears ? 
Alas! the mother who remains, what comfort can she find, but this: 
The one that's gone is happier than the one she leaves behind. 



Clay ion's Quaker Cook- Book. 79 

Have you a friend, a comrade dear, 

An old and valued friend t 
Be sure your term of sweet concourse 

At length must have an end; 
And when you part, as part you will, oh ! take it not unkind, 
If he, who goes, is happier than you he leaves behind. 

(jod wills it so! and so it is; 

The Pilgrims on their way, 
Though weak and worn, more cheerful are 

Than all the rest who stay. 
And when at last, poor man, subdued, lies down to death resigned, 
May he not still be happier far than those he leaves behind? 



In Sghool Days. 



Still sits the school -house by the road, 

A ragged beggar sunning; 
Around it still the sumachs grow, 

And blackberry vines are running. 

Within the master's desk is seen. 
Deep scarred by raps official; 

The warping floor, the battered seats. 
The jack-knife's carved initial. 

Long years ago, one winter's sun 

Shone over it at setting; 
Lit up the western window pane. 

And low eaves icy fretting. 

It shone upon the tangled curls, 
And brown eyes full of grieving, 

Of one who still her steps delayed, 
While all the school were leaving. 



8o Clayton's Quaker Cook- Book. 

For near her stood the little boy 
Her childish favor singled; 

His cap was pulled low on his brow, 
Where pride and shame were mingled. 

With restless foot he pushed the snow 
To right and left; he lingered; 

As restlessly her tiny hands 
The blue checked apron fingered. 

He saw her lift her eyes, 

He felt the soft hand's light caressing. 
He heard the trembling of her voice, 

As if a fault confessing. 

•' I'm sorry that I spelt the word, 

I hate to go above you," 
" Because" — the brown eyes lower fell — 

*' Because, you see, I love you." 

Still, memory to a gray -haired man, 
That sweet child face is showing; 

Dear girl, the grasses o'er her grave 
Have forty years been growing; 

He lives to learn in Life's hard school 
How few who pass above him. 

Lament their triumph and his loss, 
Like her, because she loves him. 



Let fate do her worst! there are relics of joy, 

Bright dreams of a past, which she cannot destroy; 
Which came in the night-time of sorrow and care, 

And bring back the features that joy used to wear. 
Long be my heart with such memories filled, 

Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled; 
You may break, you may shatter that vase, if you will. 

But the scent of the roses will hang round it still! 

Thomas Moore.
