PREFACE 



This book is not intended as a substitute for the 
regular cook book. It aims to be simply a prac- 
tical handybook for the average housekeeper, who 
cannot afford to waste food which has been left 
over from her table, and who nevertheless desires 
to serve the best and most attractive dishes. 

In the average small family where there are no 
servants, or perhaps one servant, setting a table 
with the very least margin of ampleness means 
that there will inevitably follow some left-over 
food. In addition to this, it is sometimes wise 
deliberately to plan for a remainder (especially 
where the first-cooking process is a long one, or 
where the food itself admits of reheating to ad- 
vantage) in order to spare time and labor to the 
cook. Therefore, both from necessity and choice, 
the interested home-maker finds herself facing the 
problem of how to make the most and best of a 
left-over food supply. It is for such women that 
this book has been written. 

Many of the finest dishes — dishes over which

INTRODUCTION 



What to Keep on Hand 

From experience it has been found that it will 
facilitate the preparation of made-over dishes if 
the following supplies and utensils are always at 
hand : 

Supplies , 

Seasonings, spices, and herbs of all kinds, in- 
cluding cayenne pepper or paprika. 
Catsups and piquant sauces. 
Small cans of vegetables, meats, fish, and soup. 
Extract of beef or bouillon cubes. 
Canned sweet peppers. 
Salad dressings. 

Tomato paste. (Italian stores carry this.) 
Grated parmesan cheese, in bottles. 
Jar of sifted bread-crumbs. 
Unsweetened crackers. 
Cans of sweetened condensed milk. 
Cans of unsweetened evaporated milk. 
Potato flour. (Jewish stores carry this.) 

Utensils 

Meat chopper. 

Double boiler (or two saucepans that fit one in 
the other).

THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

Inexpensive wire frying-basket. 
Individual baking-dishes, such as ramekins or 
shells. 

Dover egg beater. 

Measurements 

All successftii cooks measure. Some do it with 
their eyes, and with such nicety that they forget 
the process and declare they never measure, but 
to them a "lump" of butter and a "pinch" of 
seasoning are definite units of measurement. But 
these are unsafe guides to follow. For receipts in 
this book use the standard half-pint measuring- 
cup, with the subdivisions plainly marked. 

All measures should be level for dry materials, 
and full 'for liquids. A " cup of milk " means a cup 
so filled that it cannot be safely carried across 
the room without spilling. Flour should be sifted 
once before measuring, and never packed down 
in the cup. A "spoonful" of dry ingredients, 
such as salt or flour, is not "heaping," but level — 
scraped level with a knife. 



MEATS 



Intelligent Buying of Meats 

When buying meat remember the left-over which 
may follow, and which may need a sauce. Have 
all bones that are removed from roasts and other 
cuts of meat sent home from the market. They 
make excellent stock for sauces and soup. Always 
ask for a marrow-bone with all soup and stewing 
meat; marrow is an excellent shortening, and can 
be made into an acceptable luncheon dish. In 
preparing French chops, crown of lamb, and 
similar cuts for cooking, enough trimmings are 
often paid for and thrown away to make a savory 
dish. Have these sent home. Remember, an 
allowance of suet goes with most cuts of beef. 
Do not let it accumulate. Wipe carefully with a 
damp cloth, try out in a slow oven, and keep in 
a covered earthen jar. Keep all fat from fried 
bacon in a separate jar; it is valuable for browning 
and seasoning purposes. Equal parts of chicken 
fat, flank suet, and butter make an excellent short- 
ening, which will keep for some time in a cool place, 
and can be used instead of butter. 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

Intelligent Cooking of Left-over Meats 

The greatest care must be taken not to destroy 
their digestibility. Never subject them to great 
heat for a long time. Whenever possible, let a 
hot sauce do most of the heating of rare, tender 
meat. Long, slow cooking is sometimes neces- 
sary to blend flavors and soften the hardened 
fibers of some cooked meats, but always keep the 
heat moderate. A double boiler is a good utensil 
for such cooking. 

Intelligent Seasoning of Left-over Meats 

As a rule, reheated meats need to be more high- 
ly seasoned than freshly cooked ones. It is not 
wise, however, to crowd too many flavors into one 
dish, or always use the same seasoning for the 
same dish. The exact amount of salt and pepper 
must be determined by the seasoning already in 
the meat. 

Intelligent Care of Left-over Meat 

Eternal vigilance is the price of health. Cooked 
meats are particularly attractive to flies, and flies 
are deadly. Do not put warm meat in the ice- 
box. Cover while cooling with inexpensive wire 
covers that come for the purpose. Do not forget 
it after it goes in the ice-box, but arrange for its 
prompt use. 



WHAT TO DO WITH LEFT-OVER BEEF 



The Sunday Roast and Good Carving 

Practise the art of good carving. A well-carved 
joint looks better, tastes better, and goes further. 

Gold Roast Beef with Horseradish Sauce 

Let the first use of left-over roast beef be the 
serving of it sliced and cold — it is a mistake to miss 
this use. Cut thin slices of the rare beef, arrange 
nicely on a cold platter, and garnish with something 
green and crisp. Vary by serving different cold 
sauces with the meat. Serve a vegetable salad at 
the same meal. 

Horseradish Sauce 

Season two tablespoonfuls of grated horserad- 
ish with one-quarter teaspoonful each of salt and 
sugar, and one tablespoonful of vinegar. Whip 
one-quarter cup of thick cream stiff and add it to 
the horseradish. If there is no cream, a good 
sauce may be made by soaking an equal quantity 
of grated horseradish and soft white bread-crumbs 
with twi^e as much milk, imtil Xhe mass ig cjuit^

THE COOK BOOK OP LEFT-OVERS 

soft. Season with salt, sugar, and vinegar, and 
press through a fine wire sieve. The sauce should 
be of creamy thickness. 

Roast Beef Sandwiches, Served Hot 

For four good-sized sandwiches make one cup of 
brown sauce (see page 68), adding to it. when 
cooked, one tablespoonful of finely minced sour 
pickle. Cut very thin as many slices of cold rare 
roast beef as needed. Cream two tablespoonfuls 
of butter and add to it one-quarter teaspoonful of 
made mustard. Spread the bread with this. Dip 
the slices of beef in the hot sauce and place them 
on the bread. Sprinkle with a very little chopped 
or crushed cold bacon before putting on the top 
slice of bread. Serve on a hot platter and pour the 
boiling sauce over all. 

Rare Roast Beef in Savory Tomato Sauce 

Boil together for ten minutes 

2 cups tomatoes Bit of bay leaf 

2 cloves Sprig of parsley 

3 peppercorns J teaspoonful salt 

Strain. Melt two tablespoonfuls butter; when 
bubbling, add two tablespoonftils flour and stir 
until blended. Gradually add the tomato, beating 
to avoid thickening unevenly. Let sauce boil up 
for one minute. Arrange the beef on a hot platter 
and pour the boiling sauce over it. One teaspoon- 
ful of chopped parsley may be added to the sauce 
just before taking up.

BEEF 



Beef Loaf (of Cold Beef) 

This is an acceptable way of using any of the 
small pieces of "well-done" roast beef, making an 
excellent luncheon or supper dish, especially in hot 
weather. 

Soak one tablespoonful of gelatine in one-half cup 
of cold water ten minutes. Heat three-quarters 
of a cup of well-seasoned stewed tomatoes to boil- 
ing, and pour over the gelatine, stirring well until 
gelatine is dissolved. Have ready two cups of 
chopped and seasoned meat, mixed with one table- 
spoonful of lemon-juice and one small sour pickle 
minced fine. Stir the tomato into the meat mixt- 
ure, and mold in an earthen dish. This amount 
will fill a quart dish half full. 

Beef Pie 

Cut cold roast beef into inch-square pieces, using 
two cups. Put into a quart baking-dish and season 
with one-half teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, 
one tablespoonful of tomato catsup or one-third 
cup of cooked and seasoned tomatoes. Pour over 
the meat one cup of liquid, using equal quantities 
of made gravy and hot water. Cover with a crust 
made of baking-powder-biscuit dough. For this 
amount of meat use for the dough 

I cup flour I teaspoonful baking- 

I tablespoonful powder 

butter \ teaspoonful salt 

About I cup of milk 

Fire Island Stew 

A good Monday dinner when a Sunday roast and 
macaroni have preceded it.

THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter, add one small 
sliced onion, and cook together until very slightly 
browned. To this add one and one-half cups of 
stewed tomatoes and let boil slowly for about 
fifteen minutes, or until the tomato is somewhat 
thickened. Then add one and one-half cups of 
cooked macaroni and let all cook together until 
well thickened. Just before the dinner hour, put 
into the saucepan one and one-half to two cups of 
remnants of the tender roast beef, cut small, and 
let heat. A very few minutes will suffice. Do 
not let the stew boil after the meat is added. 

Beef Souffle 

2 cups chopped beef 2 eggs 

1 cup fresh bread- i teaspoonful of 

crumbs chopped parsley 

2 cups white sauce i teaspoonful onion- 

No. 2 (page 68) juice 

Have the white sauce ready and cooled. Season 
the meat with salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and 
onion-juice. Mix meat, bread-crumbs, and white 
sauce well together. Separate the eggs and add 
the beaten yolks to the meat mixture. Beat the 
whites stiff and carefully fold them in. Turn the 
mixture into a well-buttered baking-dish and bake 
in a hot oven fifteen minutes. Serve at once in the 
dish in which it is baked. 

Pot-Roast Pie 

Remove the seeds and parboil one medium-sized 
sweet green pepper in boiling water for five minutes. 
Cut into thin slices and sprinkle a few in the bot- 
10

torn of an earthen baking-dish. Cover with thin 
slices of cold pot-roast. Add a few fine bread- 
crumbs, moisten with any of the pot-roast gravy at 
hand, or stock. Repeat until the dish is nearly 
filled. 

Peel four good-sized tomatoes, if in season; cut 
in halves and place on top. Or the whole ones 
from a can may be used instead. Season thor- 
oughly with salt and pepper and finish with a 
sprinkling of well-buttered crumbs. Bake in a 
moderate oven until the tomatoes are tender, cover- 
ing for the first ten minutes. Serve in the baking- 
dish. 

Braised Meat Balls (from Meat Trimmings) 

2 cups meat 2 tablespoonfuls 

I teaspoonful salt fine bread-crumbs 

i teaspoonful pepper i egg 

Carefully wipe, and remove most of the fat from, 
any tough ends of uncooked beefsteak, or other 
meat trimmings of beef or lamb, or both. Put 
them through a meat chopper or chop fine. Mix 
all together and form into balls — this amount will 
make eight medium-sized ones. Brown lightly in 
a little bacon fat. Put one-half can of well- 
seasoned tomatoes in an earthen baking-dish or 
casserole. Add one cup each of carrots and celery 
cut in cubes, one slice of green pepper, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, and one-quarter teaspoonful of 
pepper. Lay the meat balls on top, add any 
bacon fat left from browning them, and cover the 
dish tightly. Cook slowly in a moderate oven un- 
til the vegetables are tender — about two hours. 
Serve in the baking-dish.

THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

Twentieth-Century Hash 

Have baked six medium-sized potatoes. With 
a spoon carefully remove the potato, leaving rest of 
skin unbroken. Season the potato with one table- 
spoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of cream or 
milk, one teaspoonful of salt, and a little pepper, 
stirring lightly with a fork, but do not mash the 
potato. Add one cup of any kind of well-seasoned 
chopped beef that has been moistened with a little 
gravy, stock, or Worcestershire sauce. Fill the 
skins with this mixture, letting it rise a little above 
the top. Put a piece of butter on each and heat 
in oven. Grated cheese may be used instead of 
meat. 

Surprise Biscuits (with Beef) 

i^ cups flour 3 teaspoonfuls bak- 

2 tablespoonfuls short- ing-powder 

ening | teaspoonful salt 

About I cup of milk 

Make a biscuit dough as soft as can be handled, 
pat it lightly, roll into a thin sheet, and cut with a 
biscuit cutter. Have ready one cup of well- 
seasoned minced beef that has been moistened with 
a little gravy, stock, or milk. Form into sand- 
wiches by spreading the meat lightly on half of the 
biscuits and cover with the other half, pressing 
them together at the edges. Bake twenty minutes 
in a hot oven. This amount will make nine good- 
sized sandwiches. A brown gravy may be poured 
over them if desired. Serve hot. 

Stuffed Peppers (with Beef) 

Parboil four to six green peppers for five min- 
utes. Prepare a mixture of cooked rice and rare 

12 



BEEF 



roast beef or steak, seasoned and chopped fine. 
Moisten with a little brown sauce (see page 68) 
made from soup stock. Stuff the peppers with 
this mixture and put buttered bread-crumbs on 
top. Place in a baking-pan and bake about twenty- 
minutes in a moderate oven, basting with water and 
butter — one tablespoonful of butter to half a cup 
of hot water — as they cook. Serve on small pieces 
of toast and pour the remaining brown sauce 
around. 

Stuffed Cabbage (with Beef) with Brown Sauce 

Use Savoy cabbage. Wash it and put in boiling 
water for five minutes to allow the leaves to open. 
Chop and season the remnants of rare roast beef 
and put the meat between the leaves of the cab- 
bage. Tie the cabbage carefully to retain the 
shape. Have ready two cups of brown sauce (see 
page 68) and add to it two tablespoonfuls of vine- 
gar and a few slices of carrot and onion. Put the 
cabbage in the sauce, and cook very slowly about 
three hours. Baste occasionally. 

Minced Beef with Potato Border 

To two cups of well - seasoned mashed potato 
add the yolks of two eggs. Beat together until 
very light and creamy. Form this mixture into a 
border on a round, flat baking- dish. Score the top. 
Season two cups of any kind of cold chopped beef 
with one-half teaspoonful of onion-juice, obtained 
by pressing the cut surface of an onion against a 
grater and moving it slightly; one teaspoonful 
finely chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Add 
enough stock or milk to moisten it well. Place the 
13 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

meat inside of the potato border and brown lightly 
in a hot oven. 

A Scallop of Roast Beef with Rice 

Season the rice with one teaspoonful of bacon fat 
to each cup of cooked rice used, and put a layer 
in a baking - dish. Cover with cold roast beef 
chopped not too fine, then a layer of sliced or 
stewed tomatoes, seasoned well with salt, pepper, 
and dots of butter. Repeat until the dish is 
nearly filled, and cover with buttered bread- 
crumbs. Brown lightly in oven. If sliced to- 
matoes are used, cook until these are tender. 

Irish Rissoles 

Any kind of meat may be used for these, prefer- 
ably rare roast beef or steak. Put the meat 
through the meat grinder together with enough 
chives to flavor it. (A little onion may be used 
if chives cannot be obtained.) Add soft bread- 
crumbs from inside of loaf, seasoning, and enough 
milk to shape the rissoles. Form into round balls 
and saute in a very little hot fat, turning them 
often, that all sides may be brown. For five small 
rissoles use one cup of minced beef, a few chives, 
or half a small onion, nearly a cup of bread-crumbs, 
and a third of a cup of milk. They may be served 
plain or with white sauce, and are very quickly 
made. 

Meat Dumplings 

Season one cup of chopped meat with salt, 
pepper, and a drop or two of Tabasco sauce. Sift 
together three-quarters of a cup of flour, one and 
14 



BEEF 



one-half teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, and one- 
eighth teaspoonful of salt. Beat one egg until 
light, add to it two tablespoonfuls of milk, and stir 
this into the flour mixture. If this does not wet 
up all of the flour add more milk. The dough 
should be very stiff. Stir the meat into this, and 
drop by spoonfuls into boiling stock or boiling 
salted water and cook, tightly covered, about ten 
minutes. Serve at once with tomato sauce. 

Shepherd's Pie 

Minced roast beef Butter (mashed with 

Mashed potatoes potatoes) 

Salt and pepper Roast beef gravy 

Put beef and potatoes in layers in a buttered 
baking - dish, having potatoes at the bottom. 
Moisten meat layers generously with gravy. Sea- 
son to taste. Have top layer potatoes; dot over 
with bits of butter, and brown. This dish requires 
much rich gravy. 

Roast Lamb or Beef Re-heated 

In warming up a leg of lamb or standing rib- 
roast of beef heap up the cavity left after carving 
with mashed potato. Brush over with melted 
butter and brown in oven. 

Beef Balls with Horseradish Sauce 

Season a cup and a half of cold chopped beef 
with salt, pepper, celery salt, very little onion- 
juice, and lemon-juice ; add one beaten egg and 
form into balls. Roll the balls in a very little 
butter in a frying-pan, and toss the balls around 
15 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

in it until well heated. Serve with horseradish 
sauce (see page 7). 

Corned -Beef Hash 

This dish is most acceptably prepared by using 
some of the fat meat chopped with the lean. To 
two cups of meat chopped rather coarse, allow two 
cups of chopped potatoes. If the meat is all lean, 
pour two tablespoonfuls of melted butter over 
the potatoes before mixing them with the beef. 
Moisten well with milk or stock, using at least one- 
half cup of liquid. Season with salt and pepper. 
Melt a little butter in a frying-pan, put in the hash, 
cover tightly, and cook slowly on the cool part of 
the stove for at least half an hour. It should be 
brown and crusty on the bottom. If it is not, 
increase the heat just before turning out. 

Corned-Beef-and-Beet Hash 

Use about equal amounts of cooked corned beef 
and boiled potatoes, and a little less quantity of 
cooked beets. Chop all three separately. Mix 
and season with salt and pepper. Try out a few 
thin slices of fat salt pork until crisp, chop and 
add to mixture; use the fat (or part of it) in 
warming up the hash. Moisten with hot water. 
Heat in hot frying-pan, turning often to keep it 
from sticking. This mixture may be formed into 
balls, rolled in flour, and then browned. 

Corned Beef Creamed 

Slice any remnants of cold corned beef in thin 
pieces to make two cups. Make two cups white 
sauce No. 2 (see page 68). Cook until smooth 
16 



BEEF 



and thickened, then add the two cups of beef. 
Cook very slowly together for fifteen minutes. 

Beef Soup 

A good soup can be made of the bones and " odds 
and ends" of the roast, with the usual vegetables 
and seasonings, but the soup will be better if a little 
fresh soup meat, or perhaps end pieces from the 
steak or new roast, be used as well. Put all the 
meat into a soup-kettle together with a sliced 
onion, carrot, and a small portion of Russia turnip, 
some stalks of celery, two or three sprigs of parsley, 
six cloves, six peppercorns, a bay leaf, and one 
teaspoonful of salt. Barely cover with cold water 
and allow it to stand awhile before putting on the 
stove. Let cook slowly for four or five hours. 
Strain and set aside in a cold place for use next 
day. Remove the fat, season to taste, and serve 
clear, or with diced vegetables which have been 
first cooked in water and added to the soup ten 
minutes before serving. Do not serve this soup 
the same day in which it is cooked, for it will have 
a greasy appearance and taste. 

Deviled Marrow on Crackers 

When the marrow is not wanted in the soup, it 
can be served on crisp crackers for lunch, and 
makes a nutritious dish. Scrape the marrow-bones, 
wash them well, and cover top and bottom with 
paste made of flour and water. Tie in clean cheese- 
cloth, and boil for three-quarters of an hour. 
Remove cloth and paste, and take marrow out 
from bones. Season highly with paprika. Serve 
on crisp crackers.

Beef Croquettes Made from Soup Meat 

Chop the meat very fine. Season highly with 
salt, pepper, and celery salt. Add a little grated 
nutmeg if desired. To two cups of the chopped 
meat add one beaten egg, and moisten with enough 
thick tomato sauce (see page 71) to shape into cro- 
quettes. Roll in egg and crumbs, and fry in deep 
fat. Serve with the remainder of the tomato 
sauce re-heated and thinned.

By the long process of soup-making, flavor has 
been taken from the meat, but it still has food 
value. It should be highly seasoned to make it 
palatable.

over caper sauce, and if necessary add enough 
fresh sauce to well cover each layer of meat. Have 
ready two cups of well-seasoned, hot mashed 
potato and turnip, using one and one-half cups of 
mashed potato to one-half cup of mashed turnip. 
Be careful to have them well seasoned and well 
beaten, and then press through a ricer (or coarse 
sieve), letting the mixture fall lightly over the top 
of the pie as a cover. Brush the top with egg yolk 
beaten lightly with a little water. Brown lightly 
in the oven. Serve currant jelly with this dish.

hot. Beef or veal may be used instead of lamb. 

Lamb's Liver Hash 

Chop fine some left-over liver and heart which 
have been steamed or sauted. Add nearly twice as 
much seasoned left-over or fresh mashed potatoes. 
Moisten well with stock or gravy, add more season- 
ing, put into pan with hot bacon fat, and saut6 
slowly until a brown crust has formed under- 
neath. Fold hash over in pan, turn out on 
platter, and dress with plenty of fresh parsley. 
Lamb's liver is excellent and inexpensive, and 
should be more generally used. 

Patty-Pan Pies 

Cut any remnants of baked or boiled lamb or 
mutton in small pieces, discarding all bone and 
gristle. Season with salt, pepper, and a little 
onion- juice if desired. For two cups of such meat 
allow one cup of any left-over gravy diluted with 
a little hot water, or one cup of good stock made 
from the bones and bits of meat, flavored with 
vegetables, and thickened with one tablespoonful 
of flour. Heat meat and gravy together. Line 
patty-pans with good plain pastry, rolled rather 
thin. Fill with the warm meat and cover with 
pastry. Bake in rather a moderate oven until 
the pastry is cooked, about half an hour. Each 
patty makes an individual portion, and can be 
served with or without brown sauce (see page 68).

WHAT TO DO WITH LEFT-OVER VEAL 
AND PORK 



Blanket of Veal 

This dish may be prepared, if desired, from a 
mixture of cooked and uncooked veal. Discard all 
gristle and hard portions of any roasted veal. Cut 
in inch squares. To one cup of such meat allow 
three-quarters of a pound of uncooked breast of 
veal. Cover the raw meat with hot — not boiling 
— water. Add any bones from the roast, and two 
tablespoonfuls of any flavoring vegetables at hand 
(such as carrots, celery, and turnips, chopped), a 
sprig of parsley, one bay leaf, one teaspoonful of 
salt, and one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper. Cover 
and cook slowly until veal is nearly tender, then 
add the cold meat, and simmer gently ten minutes 
longer. Take out the meat and strain the broth. 
There should be two cups; if not, make up with 
boiling water. Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour, and add the hot 
broth. When thickened, add one egg yolk beaten 
up with four tablespoonfuls of cream or rich milk. 
Remove from the fire at once, add one tablespoon- 
ful of lemon-juice, and pour over the hot meat. 
33 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

One cup of cooked peas may be added to the sauce 
if desired. This dish is often called Veau d la 
Blanquette. 

Veal Scallop with Oysters 
To every cup of finely chopped veal allow twelve 
good-sized oysters. Season the meat highly with 
salt, paprika, and one teaspoonful of lemon-juice. 
Moisten it with a little stock. Arrange in layers 
in a baking-dish beginning with the veal, and 
sprinkle some well - buttered cracker - crumbs be- 
tween each layer and on top. Add one-half cup 
thin cream or milk, and one-half cup of strained 
oyster liquor, to each measure of veal. Bake in a 
hot oven about fifteen minutes. 

Jellied Veal 

When ordering a roast of veal have some bones 
sent home with it. Wash these well, cover with 
cold water, add one cup of diced vegetables — car- 
rot, turnip, celery, onion, and one bay leaf — and 
let simmer for three or four hours. Strain the 
stock, let it cool, cover, and set in the ice-box. 
This will keep for several days. When ready to 
use skim off any fat on top, and to each cup of 
stock add one-quarter teaspoonful of salt, one- 
eighth teaspoonful of pepper, one-half teaspoonful 
of lemon-juice, and a very little paprika. Cut any 
remaining veal in thin slivers — there should be an 
equal quantity of meat and stock — and simmer 
together until the veal is moist and tender. If the 
meat falls short, use two or three " hard-boiled" 
eggs cut in neat slices and mixed with the meat 
after it is removed from the fire. Mold in a bread- 
pan and serve cold.

butter, stir in one-half tablespoonful of flour, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of salt, and add slowly one- 
half cup of cream or rich milk, and cook until 
sauce thickens. Mix one egg yolk with one tea- 
spoonful cold water and add to sauce, together with 
the seasoned veal. Remove from the fire as soon 
as meat is heated, and serve on hot biscuits. 

Veal and Potato Puff 

Season two cups of finely chopped veal with 
salt, paprika, and one tablespoonful catsup.

light and creamy. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites 
of the two eggs. Butter a baking-dish, and cover 
the bottom with half of the potato, spread 
all of the meat on top, and cover with the rest of 
the potato. Brown in hot oven.

WHAT TO DO WITH LEFT-OVER HAM 
AND BACON 



Baked Ham and Eggs 

Butter a shallow baking-dish and sprinkle two 
tablespoonfuls of well-buttered soft bread-crumbs 
on the bottom. Add one cup of cooked ham 
chopped and one-quarter cup of hot milk. Break 
on top the number of eggs desired. Season and

water-cress, if at hand, and serve in the baking- 
dish. 

Ham with Macaroni 

Boil a scant three-quarters cup of broken maca- 
roni in plenty of boiling, salted water until tender 
— about forty minutes. This should make two 
cups when cooked. Drain and rinse well under 
cold water so it will not be pasty. Add four table- 
spoonfuls of grated cheese. Reheat over hot 
water, adding enough cream or milk to moisten — 
about one tablespoonful. When well heated mix 
in lightly with a fork one cup chopped cooked ham 
that has been moistened with four tablespoonfuls 
45

of mustard sauce (see page 75). This makes a good 
luncheon dish, and can be prepared with two cups 
of any cold macaroni and cheese. 

Ham Omelet 

Make white sauce No. i A (see page 68), and cool 
slightly. Chop enough cold ham to make four 
full tablespoonfuls. Beat the whites of four eggs 
stiff. Beat the yolks until thick, then add salt and 
pepper and four tablespoonfuls of the white sauce. 
Cut and fold into this mixture the beaten whites of 
the eggs. 

Melt a tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan, 
pour the omelet into this, and cook over a slow 
fire until it has puffed up and is slightly browned 
underneath. Sprinkle the ham over the surface 
and place in the oven a moment to "set" the top 
of the omelet. Do not leave it, or it will become 
too dry. Fold over, turn out on a hot platter, 
and serve immediately with the remainder of the 
white sauce poured around it. Parsley may be 
added, either as a garnish or chopped and mixed 
with the white sauce. 

Creamed Ham (in Chafing-dish) 

Remove yolks from three or four hard-cooked 
eggs, and cut the whites in rings. Have ready 
minced seasoned ham, prepared by chopping fine 
or putting through meat grinder any small left- 
over pieces. Make in the chafing-dish white sauce 
No. 2, put ham in, and heat through. (Do not 
let boil while making these additions.) Add 
whites of eggs, season highly, grate yolks over top, 
ftn4 serve from dish.

Ham Sandwich Filling 

Chop very fine the meat from the shank of 
boiled ham. Mix with enough boiled salad dress- 
ing (see page 75) to make thick paste. Pack in 
glass jar. This will keep in a cold place for a long 
time. 

Poached Egg on Yankee Toast 

While the eggs are poaching, carefully brown 
some neatly trimmed slices of bread in a little 
bacon fat. Crush a slice of cold, crisp bacon, and 
sprinkle a very little on each slice of toast, and 
serve the egg on top. Shred a leaf or two of crisp 
lettuce very fine and garnish the top of each egg. 

Liver-and-Bacon Hash 

Chop any cold cooked liver, and season with 
salt and pepper. Crush a few slices of cold, crisp 
bacon and add to it. To every cup of liver allow 
four tablespoonfuls of cooked rice, or any coarse 
cereal, and mix lightly together. Melt two table- 
spoonfuls of butter or drippings in a frying-pan, 
add one-quarter cup of tomatoes, and tiim in the 
meat mixture. Cover and simmer slowly until 
well heated. Serve on a hot platter, and garnish 
with nicely browned potato cakes. 

Minced Liver 

To each cup of cold, minced liver, add one table- 
spoonfiil of chopped onion browned in butter, and 
47

season with salt and a little paprika. Turn into 
an agate frying-pan with a little water. Sprinkle 
lightly with flour and add one-quarter cup of vine- 
gar. Simmer until well heated. 

Sausage-and-Rice Cakes 

To one cup of cooked rice — warm or cold — add 
one egg unbeaten and two tablespoonfuls of cold 
fried sausage. Mix well together and form into 
flat cakes. If the mixture is very soft, add a little 
more rice. Brown lightly in butter or drippings, 
being careful to have the fat well heated before 
adding the cakes. This amount will make six 
mediimi-sized ones.

salad, and just before it is served pour mayonnaise 
dressing over it (see page 74), tossing it over and 
over with a silver fork until each piece is coated 
with the dressing. Put into a salad bowl, or on in- 
dividual plates, and garnish with small tender ends 
and leaves of the celery, whole olives, and a few 
tmy cucumber pickles. Serve very cold.

Creamed Chicken 

Make a white sauce No. 2 (see page 68). When 
hot put into it small pieces of chicken, and half as 
much diced cooked sweetbreads as there is chicken. 
Heat through quickly, not allowing the mixture to 
boil. Just before taking up add one teaspoonful 
of well- washed parsley, chopped fine. Serve on a 
hot platter in a border of green peas. 

Chicken or Turkey Timbale with or without 
Mushroom Sauce 

When no more slices can be cut from a cooked 
chicken or turkey, take the bits of meat near the 
bones, chop fine, and to two cups of such meat 
allow one cup of soft, white bread-crumbs and one- 
half cup of hot milk. Mix the crumbs and hot 
milk together, then add the chopped meat and 
yolks of two eggs. Season with one teaspoonful 
of salt and one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper. 
Beat the whites slightly — they must not be frothy 
— and mix them well in. Turn the mixture into 
a buttered pan or mold, cover with a greased 
paper, and steam; or set in pan of hot water and 
cook in moderate oven about one hour. Carefully 
unmold on a hot platter, and serve with or with-

A Scallop of Chicken with Celery 

Cook one cup of celery, cut in inch pieces, in 
boiling slightly salted water, until tender. Save 
the water to make sauce. There should be one 
cup. Slice thin two cups of cold chicken, discard- 
ing all skin, sea'^on with salt and pepper, and 
moisten with a little left-over gravy. Melt two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, stir in two tablespoonfuls 
of flour, and when bubbling add slowly one cup of 
celery water, one-half cup of milk, one-quarter tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a little pepper. When thick- 
ened and smooth, stir in the cooked celery. Put 
a few buttered crumbs in a baking-dish and ar- 
range the chicken and sauce in alternate layers. 
Cover with well-buttered crumbs. Brown in a 
hot oven. 

Chicken Croquettes 

To be creamy inside these must be made very 
soft, then the mixture set away to cool and stiffen 
before it is shaped into croquettes. Make a white 
sauce No. 4 (see page 68). Chop the chicken fine 
and season — with salt, pepper, grated lemon rind, 
a few drops of onion-juice, grating of nutmeg, and 
a little mace. Put into the hot sauce all the 
seasoned chicken it will take up, about two cups 
to one of sauce. Set away to cool. Then shape 
into croquettes, roll in fine bread-crumbs, then in 
egg (which has been slightly beaten together with 
one tablespoonfiil of cold water), being careful to 
have every part covered with egg, then in crumbs

SAUCES 



Most made-over dishes are dependent upon some 
kind of a sauce to make them acceptable; it is 
therefore quite essential that the cook be familiar 
with the simple foundation sauces. This knowl- 
edge gained, it is an easy matter to prepare any 
of the more elaborate ones. 

A good sauce is always perfectly smooth and 
properly flavored. The smoothness is secured by 
drawing the saucepan from the high heat and add- 
ing the liquid slowly to the blended flour and fat, 
beating and stirring constantly until the sauce 
thickens. The flavoring is best secured by utiliz- 
ing all odd bits of meat, fish, bones, and vegetables 
to make savory stock, or by cooking a few chopped 
vegetables carefully in the fat and removing them 
before the flour is added. 

The use of potato flour for sauces, in the same 
proportions as wheat flour, is recommended, as it 
gives excellent results with much less cooking. 

All measures of butter should be level.

Wash celery and tomatoes well, put on to cook 
with one tablespoonful of water and boil slowly 
fifteen minutes. Put through a strainer fine 
enough to hold back the seeds. Melt the butter, 
add the flour, pepper, and salt, and, when well 
blended, the tomato, of which there should be 
half a cup. Let boil up well, remove from heat, 
and slowly stir in the hot milk. Keep the sauce 
hot, but do not allow it to boil after adding 
milk. Stir into it while on the stove the grated 
cheese. When this is melted the sauce is ready 
for the table. A good sauce for macaroni or 
spaghetti, plain boiled rice served as a vegetable, 
or for rice croquettes.

water. Beat five minutes with Dover egg beater. 
Cook over hot water, and continue to stir until 
thickened. 

Gold Sauces and Dressings 

A good oil should be used in making salad dress- 
ings, but it is not necessary to pay the highest 
price for it. An excellent quality of olive oil may 
be purchased at some of the small Italian shops 
for a reasonable amount. This low price is made 
possible since it is their own importation. 

73 



SAUCES 



There is also now on the market a good domestic 
oil prepared from cotton seed. It is largely used 
instead of the imported oil, and an excellent 
mayonnaise can be made from it. 

French Dressing No. 1 

1 tablespoonful vine- J teaspoonful salt 

gar White pepper 

3 tablespoonfuls oil 

This is the usual proportion of oil and vinegar, 
but an equal quantity of each may be used if de- 
sired, or more oil.* 

To the seasoning in a bowl add the oil and vine- 
gar, and beat with Dover beater or fork until it 
thickens slightly. Use at once. When made at 
the table the dressing will thicken more quickly 
if a bit of ice is put in the bowl with the other 
ingredients. Remove ice when dressing is made. 

French Dressing No. 2 

2 tablespoonfuls oil i tablespoonful beaten

WHAT TO DO WITH LEFT-OVER FISH 



Fish, like meat, is particularly attractive to flies, 
therefore any cooked remnants should be carefully 
screened while cooling, and never placed in con- 
tact with butter or milk in the ice-box. It should 
be reheated within twenty-four hours of the first 
cooking. Like tender meat, the fiber of fish is 
hardened by continuous high heat, therefore great 
care should be taken in reheating it. 

Boiled Fish in Potato Border 

2 cups cooked fish, hard cooked eggs 
flaked cup drawn butter 

2 cups hot or cold sauce (see page 

mashed potato 70) 

I tablespoonful minced parsley 

Press the two cups of well-seasoned mashed 
potato through a ricer, letting it fall lightly around 
the edge of a flat baking-platter to form a border. 
In the center of the dish put alternate layers 
of fish, sliced eggs, and sauce, sprinkling each 
layer with a very little minced parsley. Place in 
a hot oven until sauce bubbles. Serve in the 
baking-platter. 

81 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

Spiced Fish with White Sauce 

Season highly any left-over boiled white fish 
with one of the following, or a combination: 
tomato catsup, anchovy, Worcestershire, and a 
little paprika. Make enough white sauce No. 3 
(see page 68) to cover the fish, adding two well- 
beaten egg yolks to each cup of sauce. Flake the 
fish, pour the sauce over and heat in oven. 

Clam Broth 

When frying or making a scallop of soft clams 
it is unwise to put in the long, hard neck portions, 
for they are not eaten. Use these for broth. Put 
them through a meat chopper, with a few whole 
clams, add a little water, salt as needed, and a little 
pepper. Simmer gently for a few minutes, strain, 
and serve hot or cold. This is an excellent tonic. 

Fish Cocktail 

Take a small piece of cold boiled halibut, remove 
the skin and bones and flake it. Season it with 
salt and a little pepper. Make a cocktail sauce by 
mixing together for each glass

eggs which have been seasoned with salt and

sardines to a smooth paste. Add them to any 
left-over Hollandaise sauce (see page 72). When 
ready to serve pour the sauce over the fish and 
sprinkle a few chopped capers over all. 

Creamed Fish 

Make as much white sauce No. 2 (see page 68) 
as there is flaked fish, and add a slight grating of 
nutmeg. Season the fish well with salt and pepper, 
and add to the hot sauce, together with a few 
spoonfuls of cooked green peas, and serve as soon 
as heated. 

Fish with Creamed Oysters 

A little left-over boiled fish and a few creamed 
oysters arranged in ramekins with any white or 
drawn butter sauce (see pages 67-70), covered with 
buttered crumbs and browned in oven, make an 
acceptable luncheon dish.

with butter. The mixture should be quite moist; 
if not, add a little fish stock or milk. Cut length- 
wise as many green sweet peppers as needed, re- 
move seeds, parboil five minutes, and fill them 
with the fish. Put them in an agate baking-pan, 
surround with hot fish stock or boiling water half 
an inch deep, and cook until cases are soft, but 
not broken. 

Fish Loaf 
Flake the remnants of any baked fish. There 
should be two cups ; if not, fill out with raw oysters. 
Add one cup of stuffing left from the fish, or one 
cup of coarse bread crumbs moistened with melted 
butter, and one beaten egg. Season well with salt, 
pepper, and one teaspoonful finely minced pickle. 
Turn into a small bread-pan or quart mold, cover 
with buttered paper, place in pan of hot water

Creamed Fish in Potato Cups 

Discard all bones and skin from any boiled or 
fried fish. Season well with salt, pepper, and a 
little lemon-juice. Make white sauce No. 3 (see 
page 68), allowing half as much sauce as fish. 
Add a slight grating of nutmeg to the sauce and 
add fish to it. Put the mixture in potato cups 
and brown lightly in oven. 

Potato Cups 

These are easily made by adding one egg yolk 
to one cup well-seasoned mashed potato. The 
potato should be slightly warm. This amount 
will make four cups. Invert any custard cups or 
jelly-glasses and cover the outside, bottom and 
two inches up the sides with the potato mixture. 
Smooth over and set away to get cold. When 
ready to use turn right side up on a well-buttered 
flat pan and very carefully remove the molds. 
Brush the outside with beaten egg and milk before 
adding the fish. 

Fresh Fish Cakes 

Any kind of cooked fish can be used for these. 
It should be shredded fine and highly seasoned 
with salt, pepper, and a little Worcestershire 
sauce, if liked. Moisten dry fish, such as fresh 
cod or haddock, with a little melted butter. Mix 
the fish with an equal quantity of mashed potato. 
The best results are obtained when the potato is

freshly mashed, seasoned well with salt, butter, a

on slices of buttered toast with tomato sauce (see 
page 71). 

Fish Salad in Green Peppers 

Cut lengthwise three or four green sweet pep- 
pers, remove the seeds and set away to chill. Dis- 
card all skin and bones from any cold boiled fish 
and pick apart into suitable sized pieces for salad. 
Season it with salt and pepper as needed, and 
sprinkle with a little lemon-juice. When ready to 
prepare the salad, mix the fish with enough 
mayonnaise (see page 74) or cold HoUandaise 
sauce (see page 72) to cover it well. Fill the 
peppers with this mixture, letting it fall in lightly, 
and garnish the top of each with a slice of hard- 
cooked egg. This makes a good Saturday luncheon 
dish in warm weather.

luncheon. It spoils quickly, so should be cooked 
promptly. If not baked with the fish, put the roe 
in slightly salted boiling water and simmer gently 
for about fifteen minutes. Drain and wipe dry. 
Dip in beaten egg, roll in fine white bread-crumbs, 
and brown lightly in a little butter. While still 
warm pour over it two tablespoonfuls lemon- juice 
and season with salt and a little paprika. Set 
away to chill. When ready to serve cut it in 
suitable-sized pieces and mix with it an equal 
quantity of very crisp cucumber cubes. Cover 
with a mayonnaise dressing (see page 74) and 
decorate the top with capers and chopped olives. 
Serve on crisp lettuce-leaves. This salad should 
be prepared just before serving. 

Jellied Fish 

In summer cold fish is quite as acceptable as 
warm, and a luncheon dish can easily be prepared 
by mixing one and one-half cups of any well- 
seasoned cold flaked fish with two tablespoonfuls 
of chopped capers. Soak one tablespoonful of 
granulated gelatine in two tablespoonfuls of cold 
water for half an hour. Add one cup of boiling 
water and stir until the gelatine dissolves. Then 
add two tablespoonfuls of lemon- juice and a little 
salt. Put slices of hard-cooked eggs in the bottom 
of an earthen mold holding about a quart, and add 
the fish. Pour the jelly carefully over all and put 
on ice to harden. Garnish a platter with water- 
cress or lettuce and turn the mold out on this. It 
must be served at once after unmolding. . Use 
any kind of salad dressing, or sauce Tartare (see

and potato separately. If potato is freshly boiled 
and warm when dressing is added, seasoning 
will penetrate potato more easily, giving better 
flavor. When ready to put salad together, drain 
off any excess of liquid, add chopped sweet red 
peppers (canned), and mix carefully, that potato 
may keep its shape. Season more highly if neces- 
sary. Serve in individual portions on crisp lettuce- 
leaves, putting a spoonful of mayonnaise dressing 
(see page 84) on top of each. Garnish with nar-

stir until smooth. Add one cup of boiling water 
and one cup of strained oyster-juice. Season with 
salt and pepper and let boil. Mix beaten yolk of

Salmon Canapes 

Small pieces of white or rye bread can be profit- 
ably utilized by cutting them into neat round or 
oblong shapes, browning in fat in a frying-pan, and 
spreading with a canape mixture made by rubbing 
some bits of smoked salmon to a smooth paste, 
mixing it with one tablespoonful of mixed mustard, 
one tablespoonful of Tarragon vinegar, one table- 
spoonful of finely chopped green sweet peppers,

Serve these at the beginning of a luncheon or a 
dinner. 

Salmon Soup 

The remnants of any canned or boiled salmon 
may be used for this. Pick the fish apart and 
moisten with the liquor in the can and a little warm 
water, or water in which the fish was boiled. Press 
it through a puree strainer. There should be one 
cup fish pulp and liquid. Season with salt and 
pepper as needed. Make two cups of white sauce 
No. I (see page 67), add the fish, and heat to- 
gether, but do not boil. Just before serving add 
a little well-washed and finely minced parsley, or 
a tablespoonfui of hot green peas. If too thick, 
thin with a little hot milk.

WHAT TO DO WITH LEFT-OVER 
VEGETABLES 



During warm weather, when vegetables are 
most abundant, great care should be taken not 
to allow them to accumulate in the ice-box or 
pantry, as they spoil quickly after being cooked. 
As a general rule, they are not injured, either in 
digestibility or flavor, by reheating, and as they 
are an expensive item in the food bill, especially 
in cities, they should never be wasted. Even a 
spoonful or two of almost any cooked vegetable 
will help to flavor a soup or sauce. 

Dried Celery Leaves or Parsley 

Thoroughly dry all celery leaves or parsley in a 
cool oven or on the warming shelf. Pulverize by 
rubbing through a sieve and put in bottles. These 
make an unexcelled seasoning for soups. 

Macedoine Garnish 

A few spoonfuls of cooked peas, asparagus tips, 
carrots, or string-beans that have been served with- 
out a cream sauce, may any or all be reheated and 
used to garnish a platter of broiled chops. A few 
left-over radishes kept crisp and sliced very thin^

THE COOK BOOK OP LEFT-OVERS 

without peeling, make an attractive garnish with 
parsley and slices of lemon for baked fish. 

Puree of Vegetable 

Take one creamed onion, a few peas, carrots, 
string-beans, or other green vegetables left from 
dinner, and while still slightly warm pass them 
through a sieve together. Keep in a cool place. 
Use this pulp the next day for a cream soup 
by seasoning it as needed, adding to it equal quan- 
tity white sauce No. i (see page 67, and heat- 
ing all together. A spoonful or two of sweet cream 
is always an addition to such soups. 

Vegetable Hash 

Chop turnips, cabbage, beets, carrots, and onions, 
one or all, with cold boiled potatoes ; season, moisten 
with little milk or gravy, and brown quickly in hot 
bacon fat, butter, or dripping. 

Omelet with Vegetables 

A breakfast omelet may be varied by spreading 
it, just before folding, with a few green peas or 
asparagus tips, or a little stewed corn or tomatoes 
that have been heated and well seasoned. 

Asparagus with Cheese 

2 cups cooked aspara- J cup grated cheese 
gus, cut in half- 4 tablespoonfuls melt- 
inch pieces ed butter 

I cup soft bread- J cup milk

bread-crumbs, asparagus and cheese, seasoning 
each layer. Sprinkle a few buttered cracker- 
crumbs on top. Pour the milk over all. Brown 
lightly in a hot oven. 

Asparagus Soup 

Cut the tender tips from cook'^d asparagus, set 
them aside and cook the stalks in some of the 
water in which the asparagus was cooked the day 
before. Cook down to a cupful, strain, and add 
to two cupfuls of white sauce No i A (see page 
68). Heat to boiling, add the asparagus tips, 
and serve.

Prepare bean pulp as in preceding rule, com- 
bine it with the thin white sauce, add seasoning 
and, if necessary, hot milk to thin it. 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

Baked-Bean Salad 

Drain the liquid from baked beans, season more 
highly, and add a little chopped cucumber pickle. 
Serve in a bed of lettuce-leaves, dressing with 
mayonnaise. This salad may be the principal dish 
for a winter luncheon, as it has much food value. 

A Good Way to Warm Over Baked Beans 

Put into a hot frying-pan some of the pork cooked 
with the beans. When the fat has melted and is 
hot, pour in the beans, cover, and set pan back on 
stove where beans will cook slowly and brown 
underneath. Fold over like an omelet, turn out 
on a hot platter and serve with savory tomato 
sauce (see page 71), or tomato catsup. Garnish 
dish with parsley.

or canned. Season as needed,* and heat slowly- 
together. A little chopped cooked bacon may be 
added if desired. 

Creamed Beets 

Any left-over beets that have been served with 
butter and no vinegar may be creamed by way 
of variety. Chop them coarse, and to each cup 
of beets allow one cup of white sauce No. 2 (see 
page 68). Heat together. 

Cabbage Scallop 

Season more highly any left-over cooked cab- 
bage, mix with white sauce No. i A (see page 68) in 
the proportion of one cup of sauce to two of cab- 
bage. Butter a baking-dish, put in the mixture, 
and cover with buttered crumbs, using one table- 
spoonful melted butter to one-third cup of dried 
and rolled bread-crumbs. Bake in a quick oven 
until the sauce bubbles through the crumbs and 
they are brown. Individual ramekins may be 
used instead of the larger dish. 

Creamed Cabbage in Cheese Shells

Carrots and Peas in Croustades 

Prepare four croustades (for receipt, see below). 
Combine any left-over cooked carrots and peas, 
cutting the carrots into dice. Add seasoning if 
necessary, and mix with white sauce No. 2 (see 
page 68). Heat and serve in hot croustades.

crumbs and egg, and fry in deep fat. 

Cauliflower in Ramekins 

Separate the flowerets of any cold cauliflower, 
toss them carefully about in a little melted butter, 
and pour over them an equal quantity of cheese 
sauce (see page 69). Place the mixture in rame- 
kins, sprinkle the top lightly with buttered crumbs, 
and heat in oven until sauce bubbles through. 

Sauted Cauliflower 

Cut cold cooked cauliflowet into pieces of suit- 
able size, dip lightly in flotir seasoned with salt and 
pepper, and brown in hot bacon fat or dripping. 

Celery Soup 

Take the tough stalks, leaves, and roots of any 
celery. Wash carefully, cut in small pieces, cover

with about three cups of slightly salted boiling 
water, and cook until very soft. Pass all through 
a wire sieve. There should be two cups of pulp 
and liquid. Scald two cups of milk in a double 
boiler with one slice of onion. Strain and use this 
in making two cups white sauce No. i (see page 
67). Add the celery mixture to this, and heat all 
together, but do not boil. Serve very hot with 
croutons (see page 149)- 

Celery Toast 

Take the outer and less tender stalks of celery 
that are often thrown away, cut them into half-inch 
pieces, and cook in very slightly salted water until 
tender. Drain and use one-half cup of this 
water and one-half cup of milk to make a white 
sauce No. 2 (see page 68). Add the celery to the 
sauce, and pour over slices of nicely .browned and 
buttered toast. Serve very hot. 

Escalloped Celery 

Use the coarse, large pieces of celery not suit- 
able to serve uncooked. Cut them into small pieces. 
Butter a baking-dish, put in a layer of celery, then 
a layer of tomatoes (canned ones may be used). 
Sprinkle over them a teaspoonful of chopped onion, 
a little salt and pepper. Repeat, having last layer 
tomatoes. Cover with small cubes of bread and 
dot with a tablespoonful of butter. Bake in hot 
oven half an hour. 

Corn "Oysters" 

Grate the pulp from ears of any cooked sweet 
corn, and to each cup allow one egg beaten light,

one tablespoonful milk, one tablespoonful flour, 
one teaspoonful melted butter, one half teaspoonful 
salt. Mix all together and drop by spoonfuls on 
a hot buttered griddle and brown on both sides. 
A little uncooked corn pulp is a great addition to 
these cakes. 

Corn in Tomato Gases 

Remove most of the pulp from six medium-sized 
tomatoes. Rub the inside of the cases with salt, 
pepper, and a little softened butter. Fill them 
with one cup of stewed corn mixed with one table- 
spoonful of grated cheese. Cover lightly with but- 
tered crumbs, place in an agate pan, and bake until 
the cases are tender but not broken. 

Corn Cakes 

Take equal parts of mashed potato and cooked 
corn, add pepper, salt, and beaten egg to bind 
together. Dip the flat cakes in flour and saut6 
in hot butter or bacon fat, or form into balls, roll 
in bread-crumbs, in egg, and in crumbs again. Fry 
in deep fat. A tomato sauce may be served with 
these (see page 71).

scraped corn aside; there should be half a cupful. 
Cook cobs in water with onion, celery, and salt 
for half an hour, or until the water is reduced to 
one cupful. Add this to the white sauce, season 
more highly if necessary, boil up well, and when 
ready to serve put in the half cupful of corn. 
Heat a little, but do not boil. Beat egg and 
put into the tureen, pour the soup gradually over 
it, stirring, to mix evenly.

put in the seeds). Sprinkle top with crumbs and 
brown. Serve very hot. (It is cooked in about 
twenty minutes.) 

Corn Pudding (from Uncooked Corn) 

Com on the cob loses flavor sooner than any 
vegetable. Do not try to serve it in that way 
unless perfectly fresh. If any uncooked ears are 
left over grate them. Six good-sized ears will 
give one and one-half cups of corn pulp. Add to 
this one egg beaten very light, one-quarter tea- 
spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sugar, one tea- 
spoonful of butter, and one-quarter cup of milk. 
Butter a quart baking-dish, pour in the mixture, 
and bake until firm in the center — about twenty- 
five minutes. Serv^ at once as a vegetable.

Stewed Cucumbers 

Use those which are too large and old to slice 
raw. Pare them and cook in boiling salted water 
until tender. Slice in quarters lengthwise, and re- 
heat in drawn butter sauce (see page 70) or white 
sauce No. 2 (see page 68). A dish similar to 
English vegetable marrow. 

Scallop of Eggplant 

Chop the remnants of fried eggplant rather 
coarse. Arrange in ramekins in alternate layers 
with well-buttered cracker-crumbs, finishing with 
the crumbs. Pour enough milk over so that it 
can just be seen, and brown in a hot oven. This 
dish resembles oysters in taste.

Green-Pea or Lima-Bean Soup 

Cook any left-over peas or Lima beans with a 
little cold water until soft. Strain, and for every 
cup of the puree use two cups of white sauce No. i 
(see page 67). Combine mixtures, thinning with 
hot milk if necessary. Serve with croutons (see 
page 149). Dried Lima beans may be used. 

Chopped Potatoes 

Chop cold boiled potatoes fine and season well 
with salt and pepper. Heat a pan and melt in it 
one or two tablespoonfuls bacon fat or dripping.

When the fat is hot turn in the potatoes, smoothing 
them evenly in the pan. Cover with a tin, let them 
steam a few minutes, set on one side of the stove, 
and brown slowly. Turn over like an omelet and 
serve on hot platter. Stewed potatoes may be 
warmed over in this way, but do not chop them. 

Stewed Potatoes 

Cut cold baked or boiled potatoes into dice, put 
into a stew-pan with salt, a tiny bit of onion 
minced fine, and milk enough to half cover the 
potatoes. Set on the back of the stove and stew 
slowly, stirring with a fork occasionally, until all 
the milk is taken up. Season with butter and 
pepper and serve. 

Scallop of Baked Potatoes and Cheese 

Peel the left-over potatoes as soon as the meal 
is over. When ready to use, season them well with 
salt, pepper, and melted butter. In a buttered 
baking-dish arrange alternate layers of pota- 
toes, grated cheese, and white sauce No. 2 (see 
page 68), having sauce on top. Sprinkle very 
lightly with buttered crumbs and heat in oven. 

Potato Salad 

New potatoes make the best salad, and if they 
have been boiled with the jackets on so much the 
better. Cut them in neat dice shapes. Season 
well with salt and pepper. To two cups add one- 
half teaspoonful onion-juice, if liked; one table- 
spoonful very finely minced capers, two table- 
spoonfuls melted butter, and one tablespoonful 
lemon- juice. Toss all together carefully so as not

leaves. Garnish with rings of the white of hard- 
cooked egg, and sift yolk on top. 

Potato Pyramids 

To one cup of well-seasoned mashed potatoes add 
one egg yolk. Beat until light. Take up by 
tablespoonfuls and form into pyramid shapes by 
pointing one end, and broadening the other as a 
base to stand on. Set them on a buttered tin, 
brush over with beaten egg, and when ready to 
serve, brown lightly in the oven. These make an 
attractive garnish for meat dishes. Mashed pota- 
toes are more easily handled if shaped directly 
after a meal is over, while still slightly warm.

croutons or a little grated cheese over each plate 
of soup. 

Potato Balls 
Form any well-seasoned mashed potatoes into 
balls the size of English walnuts. With a tea- 
spoon press a hollow in the top of each ball. Fill 
the space with one teaspoonful finely minced ham. 
Brush the balls with egg beaten with a little milk 
or water. Place on a greased pan and brown in 
oven. These make a good garnish and relish for 
a platter of chops. 

Creamed Potatoes 

Cut cold boiled potatoes in rather thick slices. 
Season with salt and a little white pepper. Toss 
them lightly in a little melted butter, being care- 
ful not to break them. Barely cover with rich milk 
and add one teaspoonful of flour to each cup of 
milk used. Cover and cook very slowly until the 
mixture is well thickened and creamy. Just be- 
fore serving add a little finely chopped parsley. 
By way of variety, these may be served in turnip 
cups, which are made by cutting a slice from the 
bottom of small white turnips, paring them, and 
cooking in salted water; when tender, scoop out

oven or in a very little fat in the frying-pan. 
These make an attractive garnish for a platter of 
chops or a platter of fried fish, alternated with 
slices of lemon. 

Irish Potato Cake 

To one cup of mashed potatoes add a well-beaten 
egg, half a cup of flour, and half a teaspoonful of 
salt. Mix well, turn out on well-floured board, 
adding a little more flour for kneading, and form 
into a cake half an inch thick. Cut this cake into 
wedge-shaped pieces and brown on a hot griddle 
to a light color. Then cover with an inverted pan 
and cook on the back of the stove until it is crusty — 
about twenty minutes. It is to be eaten hot with 
butter.

Vegetable Salads 

These may be made of almost all kinds of cold 

cooked vegetables, using them separately or in 

combination. Bits of meat or fish may be added, 

or a few chopped nuts, if at hand. Lettuce or

VEGETABLES 



other salad leaves may or may not be used, as 
convenient. The materials should be carefully 
prepared, and the salad chilled before serving. A 
better flavor is given to many salads by mixing the 
materials with a French dressing a short time be- 
fore the mayonnaise is added, which is usually just 
before the salad is ready for the table. 

Various garnishes are used, as olives, beets 
fresh or pickled, capers, hard-cooked eggs, pickled 
eggs, buds and leaves of nasturtiums, pickles, etc. 
The salad-maker should be artistic as well as in- 
genious, for harmony in color is essential. Over- 
crowding should be avoided. If the salad be ser- 
ved on a platter, leave a wide margin. 

Kidney-Bean Salad 

Combine one cup of cooked kidney-beans with 
one cup of crisp, tender summer cabbage, shredded. 
Add one green sweet pepper, first removing the 
seeds and shredding it fine. Cover with French 
dressing No. i (see page 73), or mayonnaise dress- 
ing (see page 74) and serve at once. 

Salad of Greens 

Left-over spinach or greens of any kind may be 
molded in small cups and served cold with French 
or mayonnaise dressing. The little balls of cottage 
cheese (see page 179) are good with this. 

Mixed Salad (Italian) 

Put lettuce leaves into a deep bowl, add a little 
cauliflower, two or three sardines, and two large

J cup flour I tablespoonful butter 

Salt and pepper 

(Any left-over sliced raw tomatoes, if firm and 
solid, may be kept covered with cold water for 
use next day.) 

Dry the slices of tomato if they have been in 
water, season with salt and pepper, and dredge 
both sides well with flour. Melt butter in pan; 
when hot put in tomato, browning well on one 
side before turning. When both sides are brown 
remove to a hot platter. Gradually add milk to 
flour and butter in the pan, stirring well. Pour 
this sauce around the tomatoes and serve.

not boil. Serve with crisp crackers, croutons (see 
page 149), or dried bread. 

Scalloped Tomatoes 

To every cup of stewed tomatoes add half a tea- 
spoonful of scraped onion and more seasoning if 
necessary. Season some dried and rolled bread- 
crumbs and mix part of them with melted butter 
in the proportion of two tablespoonfuls butter to 
half a cup of crumbs. Butter small ramekins or 
large dish, sprinkle a layer of seasoned crumbs on 
the bottom, pour in tomato, and spread buttered 
crumbs over the top. Dot over with more butter 
if desired. Bake in hot oven about thirty-five 
minutes, browning crumbs well on top. A mix- 
ture of bread and cracker crumbs may be used. 

Tomatoes with Scrambled Eggs 

A few spoonfuls of stewed tomato may be mixed 
with eggs and scrambled. Beat eggs slightly with 
a fork, season, and mix with tomato. Melt in hot 
omelet-pan half a tablespoonful of butter, pour in 
eggs and tomato, and cook lightly, holding pan away 
from the intense heat. Pour over prepared toast or

Soak gelatine in one-foiirth cup cold water. When 
soft, dissolve with hot strained tomato. (If to- 
mato is very acid, add one-eighth teaspoonful of 
soda.) Pour into small cups or molds wet with 
cold water. When tomato is stiffened turn out on 
lettuce leaves. Sprinkle with chopped celery and 
serve with mayonnaise. Half this quantity will 
make four small molds. Canned tomatoes may 
be used.

glass jars. This will be found very useful in 
flavoring soups and sauces. 

Tomato and Cheese Toast 

Left-over slices of raw tomatoes may be ac- 
ceptably utilized by placing one slice each on nicely 
browned and buttered toast circles. Season well 
with salt, pepper, and bits of butter. Cover with

WHAT TO DO WITH LEFT-OVER CEREAU5 



Most cereals are improved by long, slow cook- 
ing. This is emphatically true of hominy, corn- 
meal, and oatmeal, any one of which may be re- 
heated to advantage. It is wise, therefore, to 
plan always for a remainder when cooking them. 
They are a comparatively cheap food, and when 
so cooked as to yield their full nutritive value, they 
form an important part of the dietary. They 
lend themselves easily to many transformations, 
and so give variety to the daily menu. 

Corn meal Circles 

Do not allow left-over cornmeal mush to get per- 
fectly cold before molding it. Beat it well, so that 
it will be perfectly smooth, and pour it into baking- 
powder tins, or half an inch deep in a fiat pan, first 
moistening the tin with cold water. When ready 
to use cut in circles half an inch thick. If molded 
in a flat sheet use a biscuit cutter. Roll in milk, 
then very lightly in flour. Heat a little butter or 
bacon fat on a baking-tin until it bubbles, lay the 
circles on this', and brown lightly in a very hot oven. 
These make a good garnish for a meat dish, or may 
be served with maple syrup for breakfast or lunch.

THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

Cereal Molded with Fruit 

Take cream of wheat or wheatena left from 
breakfast. If very stiff add a little milk or water 
and stir into it a few scalded cut-up dates or figs. 
Pour into bowl or mold and serve cold as a dessert 
with sugar and cream. 

Cereal with Tomato Salad

Cereal in Griddle Cakes 

See Sour-Milk Griddle Cakes, page 150. 

Farina Sponge 

Stir into two cups of cooked farina the stiffly- 
beaten white of one egg and one teaspoonful 
vanilla. Mold and serve with cream and sugar or 
soft custard. If farina has been cooked very 
stiff, add a little hot milk or water, blending well. 

Farina with Baked Apples 

Wash four or five good baking apples, and with 
a corer remove all seeds and cores. Place them on 
an agate baking-pan with a tablespoonful of water 
on the bottom. Fill the centers with any left-over 
farina or cream of wheat, and put a small piece 
of butter on top of each. Sprinkle sugar and a few 
drops of lemon-juice over all and bake in a mod- 
erate oven until apples are soft. Serve hot for 
breakfast or luncheon.

Beat the egg and farina together until light and 
smooth, and stir in the milk. Sift the floiir and 
salt together and add to the farina mixture. When 
ready to bake the cakes, stir in the baking-powder 
and beat the batter vigorously. These cakes will 
be found much more digestible than those made 
entirely of raw flour. 

Hominy and Cheese Souffle 

I cup cooked hominy i cup grated cheese 
J cup hot milk 2 eggs 

Grated rind of half a Salt, paprika 
lemon 

With a fork beat up the cold hominy and the 
hot milk until very smooth. Add seasonings and 
grated cheese. Separate the eggs and beat the 
yolks until thick and light, and stir into the mix- 
ture. Then fold in the stiffly beaten whites, pour 
into a buttered baking-dish, and bake in a hot oven 
until firm in center — about twenty minutes. Serve 
at once. This may also be cooked satisfactorily in 
a chafing-dish. 

Hominy Balls 

I cup cooked hominy i egg yolk 
Slight grating nutmeg Salt as needed 

Mix all well together and form into smooth balls 
the size of large English walnuts. If the hominy 
is very stiff it should be beaten up with two table- 
spoonfuls of hot milk before the other things are 
added. Roll the balls in sifted white bread- 
crumbs, then in slightly beaten egg-white, and 
again in crumbs. Brown lightly in deep, hot fat. 
This amount will make six balls.

Hominy with Bacon 

Mold two cups of cooked hominy in a low dish 
of suitable size, first rinsing the dish with cold 
water. When ready to use turn it out on a baking- 
dish that can be sent to the table. Cover the 
hominy with thin slices of bacon and cook in a 
very hot oven until the bacon is crisp. Pour off 
the superfluous fat, surround with a border of 
poached eggs, and serve at once.

buttered fiat pans about twenty-five minutes. 
Cut into suitable-sized pieces before serving. 

Oatmeal Molded with Raisins 

Cover three tablespoonfuls of good raisins with 
rapidly boiling water and let stand just long 
enough to swell out and soften. Remove the 
seeds and cut in two. Stir these into two cups of 
cooked oatmeal while still warm, being careful 
not to break the grains of oatmeal. Moisten any 
small cups or jelly-glasses with cold water, half fill 
with the mixture, and set away in a cold place. 
Serve with cream or rich milk. 

Oatmeal Gruel 

Boil two-thirds of a cup of well-cooked oatmeal 
in one cup of boiling water fifteen minutes, or until 
the grains are very soft. Add an equal amount of 
milk, a few grains of salt, and a grating of nutmeg. 
A little cream is an improvement. It may be 
served strained or unstrained, as desired. 

Browned Oatmeal 

Cut cold oatmeal into slices. Beat up one egg 
with four tablespoonfuls of milk, and dip the oat- 
meal in this. Heat a little bacon fat to bubbling 
in a frying-pan and carefully brown the slices in it.

Mix the oatmeal, sugar, salt, butter, and luke- 
warm milk together. Dissolve the yeast in the 
luke-warm water and add to the mixture. Stir in 
the flour gradually, beating it well. The amount 
of flour necessary will be determined by the soft- 
ness of the oatmeal. Let rise. This will make one 
loaf. 

Rice with Apples 

Pare, quarter, and core three or four medium- 
sized, tart apples. Cook them carefully in a syrup 
made of one cup of sugar and one cup of boiling 
water and one slice of lemon, being careful to keep 
the apples whole. While they are cooking put from 
one to two cups of cold cooked rice in a double 
boiler. Add one tablespoonful of sugar and one 
tablespoonful sweet cream to each cup of rice, 
stirring them in lightly with a fork. Cover and 
let heat thoroughly. Pile the rice in the center 
oi a glass dish and place the apples as a border 
around it. Pour the remaining syrup over all and 
garnish with a few candied cherries. This can be 
served cold if desired. 

Rice with Bananas 

Peel and scrape three well-ripened bananas and 
mash them with a fork to a smooth, creamy pulp, 
adding a very few drops of lemon- juice. Stir this 
lightly into one cup of cold cooked rice and serve 
with or without sweetened cream. This is a 
nutritious dish, and attractive to children. Ba- 
nanas have a much better flavor if purchased a 
little green, and if each one is then wrapped care- 
fully in waxed paper, put in a clean, covered box

in the bottom of a baking-dish. Cover with slices 
of raw, peeled tomatoes, and season with salt, 
pepper, a few bits of crushed bacon, and a table- 
spoonful of shredded green sweet pepper. Repeat 
until the dish is filled, reserving a little rice to 
cover the top. Bake in hot oven until the toma- 
toes are tender, covering the dish for the first ten 
minutes. 

Rice with Tomatoes No. 2 

Season about a cup and a half of stewed toma- 
toes extra well, adding a little onion-juice if liked. 
They should be stewed down thick, and not watery. 
Use an equal amount of tomatoes and cold rice. 
Arrange in layers in a baking-dish and sprinkle each 
layer of rice with grated cheese before adding the 
tomatoes. Finish with rice and cheese on top.

WHAT TO DO WITH LEFT-OVER BREAD 



The uses for stale bread are so many and varied 
that it is obviously unwise to waste a particle. 
The bread-box requires constant supervision and 
care, especially in summer, when mold forms so 
quickly. It should be examined daily in hot 
weather, and in all seasons scalded and aired well 
before each fresh baking of bread. Small bits of 
bread should be slowly dried in the oven until 
crisp and brittle, then ground in the meat-chopper 
or rolled, and kept on hand in a glass jar for 
breading articles to be fried, for scallops, croquettes, 
dry stuffings, etc. The larger dried pieces, if cut 
into presentable shapes, are an excellent substitute 
for crackers or croutons with soup, and are often 
preferred to fresh bread. Small pieces and broken 
slices of stale bread may be used for moist stuffings 
for meat and poultry, for griddle-cakes, steamed 
bread, bread omelet, toast points, puddings of 
different sorts, and for other uses which will readily 
'suggest themselves. 

Croutons 

Cut stale slices of bread half an inch thick. Trim 
off crusts (which may be set aside and used for 
149 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

puddings), butter the slices, and cut into half-inch 
cubes. Place on shallow pan and brown in a hot 
oven, turning them so that they may not burn. 
Serve with soup. 

Steamed Bread 

The very dry, hard pieces may be used in this 
way: Heat a griddle hot, butter it well, dip the 
pieces of bread quickly into hot salted water, and 
brown on both sides on the griddle. Eat with 
butter or with syrup. 

To Freshen Dry Rolls or a Loaf of Dry Bread 

Dip them quickly into cold water, drain, and 
heat in oven. 

Bread Griddle-cakes (with Sour Milk) 

Use equal quantities of sour milk and small, 
broken pieces of bread. Mix and let stand, cov- 
ered, over one or two nights. Bits of rice may be 
added to this mixture if desired. In warm weather 
a little salt may be put with it. (In this case omit 
adding salt later.) When ready to use, put through 
colander. For each pint of mixture use one egg, one 
teaspoonfiil soda, one teaspoonful sugar, one-fourth 
teaspoonful salt, and about three-quarters of a cup 
sifted flour. It is always wise to bake a small cake 
first, that any lack in ingredients may be remedied 
at once. An extra yolk or small amount of un- 
cooked egg may be added if at hand. Bake on 
hot griddle and serve with syrup. 

Syrup 

3§ cups light- brown 2 cups cold water 
sugar 

150 



BREAD 



Cook sugar and water together, stirring until 
sugar is melted. Skim well while boiling. Boil 
for about thirty minutes, or until a little of the 
liquid put on cold saucer will thicken. Syrup may 
be flavored with maple, using part maple sugar. 

Brewis (from Boston Brown Bread) 

Take dry Boston brown bread and break into 
small pieces, having two cupfuls. Put into sauce- 
pan, add milk enough to cover (one pint or more). 
Let soak awhile on back of stove; when all is soft 
draw saucepan forward and let simmer until milk 
is absorbed. Add a little salt and a tablespoonful 
of butter. Serve with cream. 

Boston-Brown-Bread Toast 

Dry slightly in the oven the needed number of 
slices of brown bread and toast them carefully over 
a slow fire. Lay them on a warm platter, butter, 
and pour over them white sauce No. i (see page 67), 
to which one or two spoonfuls of finely chopped 
cooked ham have been added. Serve very hot. 

Brown-Bread Relish 

Put a little bacon fat in a frying-pan. When it 
is hot add any cut slices of Boston brown bread and 
brown carefully. Slip a poached egg on each slice 
and serve hot. 

Bird's-nest Toast (for an Invalid) 

Cut a slice of stale bread in a large circle. Toast 
it carefidly over a slow fire until a delicate brown. 
Dip the edges very quickly in hot salted water and 
put it on a hot baking-tin, where it will keep warm, 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

Butter it if butter is allowed. Separate a perfectly 
fresh egg. Add a little salt to the white and beat 
to a stiff froth. Pile this on the toast, make a 
depression in the center, into which carefully slip 
the yolk. Heat in the oven just enough to "set" 
the yolk, and serve it on a warm plate. 

Soft Buttered Toast 

Toast six or eight slices of stale bread. Melt 
one-fourth cup butter in half a cup of boiling water 
in a bowl. Quickly dip each slice of toast in it, 
place in hot dish, and pour remainder of "dip" 
over all. 

Milk Toast 

Toast bread to a golden brown, having it dry all 
through. Keep hot in deep dish in oven. Make 
white sauce No. i (see page 67), using one and a 
half cups for six slices of toast. Pour between and 
over slices of toast and serve hot. If a softer toast 
is liked, quickly dip slices in hot water or milk be- 
fore adding sauce. 

Bread Sticks 

Remove the crusts from any slices of stale, close- 
textured bread, and cut in strips about five inches 
long and one-half inch wide. Roll in melted butter 
and brown delicately in the oven, or fry in deep, 
hot fat without rolling in butter. These can be 
served with cheese instead of crackers. 

Quick Bread Omelet

BREAD 



Make the white sauce and pour while hot over 
bread-crumbs, mixing and mashing them well. 
Beat yolks of eggs until thick, and stir them, with 
the extra seasoning, into the white sauce mixture. 
Cut and fold in the stiffly beaten whites. Have 
ready a hot, buttered frying-pan, turn in omelet, 
and cook lightly. Set pan in oven to dry off top 
of omelet, turn out on warm platter, and serve at 
once. 

Bread Sauce 

Cook in double boiler half a pint of milk with a 
small onion and two cloves. Strain, put in sauce- 
pan, and add half a cup grated white bread-crumbs 
from the inside of the loaf, mixed to a paste with 
some of the hot milk. Let boil a few minutes, stir- 
ring and blending well. Add one-fourth teaspoon- 
ful salt, a dash of cayenne, and a small piece of 
butter just before taking up. Serve with boiled 
fowl. Two teaspoonfuls chopped parsley may be 
added if desired. 

Bread Cereal 

Dry bread in oven until crisp and brown. Roll 
on board, or put through meat grinder, having 
crumbs coarse. Serve warm as a breakfast food 
with cream. 

Crust Coffee 

Cut the crusts from slices of Boston brown bread 
and brown in oven until they are much darker in 
color, but not burned. Put into saucepan, pour 
boiling water on them, and let stand covered 
where they will keep hot for fifteen minutes. 
Pour off the liquid into a hot coffee-pot, and serve

WHAT TO DO WITH BITS OF CHEESE 



Cheese is an excellent accompaniment to many 
made-over dishes, particularly to starchy foods 
and those lacking fat, as it adds both flavor and 
food value. Being a concentrated food, a little of it 
goes a long way, so there is no excuse for the least 
particle being wasted. When cheese comes from 
the store it should be wrapped in a clean cloth and 
kept in a cool, dry place. If the cloth is moistened 
with vinegar this will retard the formation of 
mold. Grate all the little dry pieces as they 
accumulate, and put in a covered glass jar. It is 
well to keep a jar or two of Parmesan cheese, 
which comes grated, always on hand to help out. 
Care must be taken not to overcook cheese, as 
this renders it indigestible. When it is to be added 
to a hot mixture let this be done, whenever pos- 
sible, just before taking from the fire. 

Cheesed Rice No. 1 

Put in a double boiler or chafing-dish two cups 
of cold boiled rice and a scant half cup of hot milk, 
and heat thoroughly over water. Then sprinkle 
lightly over it half a cup of grated cheese and a 
few shreds of pimento. Cover tightly and let 
i6s 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

stand over the hot water until the cheese is melted. 
This is acceptable for Sunday tea. 

Cheesed Rice No. 2 

Take half a cup of rice. Take any odds and ends 
of dry cheese too small to grate and melt them in 
the oven, seasoning with salt, pepper, and a little 
mixed mustard. Turn the rice out on a hot 
platter, place three or four poached eggs on top, 
and pour the melted cheese over. 

Cheese with Creamed Sprouts 

Make a cup of white sauce No. 2 (see page 68), 
and add one cup of left-over Brussels sprouts to 
the hot sauce, being careful not to break them. 
When well heated add half a cup of grated cheese 
and remove from the fire as soon as the cheese is 
melted. Serve on squares of well-buttered toast. 

Tomato Rarebit 

J cup stewed tomatoes i tablespoonful butter 
J cup grated cheese i egg 

Salt and cayenne as needed 

Strain out the seeds from the cup of well-sea- 
soned stewed tomatoes, pressing through all of the 
pulp, and let simmer uncovered until reduced to 
half a cup. Cook this rarebit over water, either in 
a double boiler or chafing-dish. Melt the butter 
and add the cheese, and stir until the cheese 
melts. Add seasonings and tomato pulp and heat 
together, stirring constantly. Blend a little of this 
hot mixture with the beaten egg before adding 
it. Remove from the heat as soon as the egg is 
166 



CHEESE 



well stirred in, and serve on slices of crisp rye- 
bread toast. 

Cheese Dreams 
With a biscuit cutter cut circles from very thin 
slices of any kind of close-textured bread. Lay 
very thinly shaved slices of cheese between the 
bread to form sandwiches. Brown lightly in hot 
butter in a frying-pan. Serve hot. 

Cheese Canapes 

With a biscuit cutter cut small circles from 
rather thin slices of rye bread, and brown them 
lightly in a little bacon fat. Put a few shreds of 
pimento on each circle, cover with grated cheese, 
and set in oven just long enough to melt the 
cheese. Serve hot as a first course. 

Cheese Sandwiches (of Hot Biscuits) 

Have ready some very thin slices of cheese. Bake 
a pan of biscuits (see Surprise Biscuits, page 12), 
and immediately on taking them from the oven 
break them open quickly, spread lightly with but- 
ter, and lay a slice of cheese between each. Cover 
with a warm napkin and serve promptly. It is 
necessary to work quickly so the warmth of the 
biscuit will melt the cheese. These are good for 
an emergency luncheon. 

Cream-Cheese Salad 

Mix an equal amount of cream cheese and 
chopped nuts well together. Add a little finely 
minced parsley. Form into balls the size of small 
English walnuts and set away to chill. When ready 
to sen^e the s^ad, dress a platter of crisp white le^ 
167 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

tuce leaves that have been well dried, with enough 
French dressing (see page 73) to moisten. Lay 
the cheese balls on the lettuce and serve at once. 
Cream cheese spoils very quickly, so any left- 
overs of it should be kept very cold and utilized 
within twenty-four hours. 

Cream Cheese on Crisp Crackers 

Take any unsweetened crackers. If they are not 
very crisp, put them on a flat baking tin and set 
in a moderate oven for a few minutes. Spread 
with beach-plum or Bar-le-Duc jelly, and drop a 
srnall teaspoonful of cream cheese in the center of 
each cracker. 

Cheese Toast 

Dry slightly in the oven and then toast- as 
many slices of Boston brown bread as needed. 
Butter and keep them warm. Make enough white 
sauce No. 2 (see page 68) to well cover the toast, 
using paprika instead of pepper. When the sauce 
bubbles add one-half cup grated cheese to each 
cup of sauce, remove from the fire at once, and 
pour over the toast. Serve very hot. 

Cheese Macaroons 

Spread some macaroons lightly with any tart 
jelly at hand. Press two together with a layer of 
snappy cheese between.

Cream the butter and sugar well together. 
Separate the eggs, adding the yolks one at a time, 
then the flavoring, and beat the mixture until very 
light. Stir in the pot-cheese and grated bread- 
crumbs. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites. Bake 
in a moderate oven. 

Cheese and Fish Souffle 

Cook half a cup of bread-crumbs to a paste in 
half a cup of rich milk, and stir in half a cup of mild 
cheese, grated.. To the yolks of two eggs add a 
little mustard, salt, cayenne, few drops of Wor- 
cestershire, half a teaspoonful lemon-juice, a little 
minced parsley, and half a 'cup of cooked fish, 
flaked. Add to first mixture and let cool. Fold in 
the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs. Set in a pan 
of hot water and bake about twenty-five minutes. 

Cheese Shell Filled with Creamed Cabbage 

A small head of young cabbage should be boiled 
in salted water until tender. Drain, chop, and 
season it. There should be two cups. Put it in 
an empty Edam or pineapple cheese shell in alter- 
nate layers with one cup of white sauce No. 2 (see 
page 68). Heat in the oven until the sauce bub- 
bles. This will give the cabbage a delicate cheese 
flavor. Boiled macaroni or rice may also be re- 
heated in cheese shells to advantage. 

Cheese Sticks (from Pie Crust) 

When there is not enough crust for another pie, 
roll it thin, cut in strips about three inches long 
and one inch wide. Moisten the edges and spread

pinch of salt, enough paprika to give it a pink 
color, and cream to make a paste. Form into 
small balls and roll in finely chopped black wal- 
nuts. Serve with lettuce and French dressing.

WHAT TO DO WITH SOUR MILX AND 
CREAM 



It often happens in warm weather, with even a 
limited milk supply, that some of it gets sour be- 
fore it can be used. This sour milk should never 
be wasted, even if there is only a little. It is a 
valuable kitchen asset. Have a clean glass or 
earthen receptacle to pour the remnants in, and 
keep in the ice-box or a cold place until enough 
has accumulated to make from a half to one cup. 
Then plan to use it as soon as it thickens, for 
milk becomes bitter if it stands too long. 

In the following receipts all soda measurements 
should be level and exact. 

Boston Brown Bread 

I cup com-meal if cups thick scut

WHAT TO DO WITH WHITES OR 
YOLKS OF EGGS 



Eggs should always be wiped with a damp cloth 
before they are broken. The shells are then all 
ready to be used for clearing coffee, soup, or jelly. 
When any uncooked whites or yolks are left over 
put them in a cup, cover with a folded damp 
cloth, and slip a rubber band around it. Left- 
over poached or soft-cooked eggs may be care- 
fully returned to hot water and cooked until hard, 
and then chopped and mixed v/ith cold meat or 
fish dishes (see Kedjeree, page 89, and Fish with 
Pie Crust, page 94) , or sliced and used for salads, 
(see Green Pea Salad in Egg Cases, page 121), etc. 
Bits of omelet or scrambled eggs are always per- 
missible in a meat hash.

WHAT TO DO WITH LEFT-OVER FRUIT 



Ripe fruit is perishable, and when the supply is 
within control, the housekeeper should take care 
to keep' it limited so there will not be large quanti- 
ties on hand. As soon as it shows signs of soften- 
ing it is no longer fit to be served as fresh fruit, 
but should be cooked up at once with a little sugar 
added, and used as a sauce; or, with more sugar 
added and cooked longer, almost any fruit can 
be made into a good jam for future use. Only 
perfectly sound, fresh fruit is safe to can. Can- 
ned fruit when opened spoils more quickly than 
any other cooked fruit; it is therefore wise always 
to use any remainder as soon as possible. It can 
be rubbed through a sieve, a little corn-starch 
added for thickening, made sweeter if necessarj'-, 
and cooked until it thickens, and used as a sauce 
for puddings. It can be molded in a corn-starch 
mixture, added to a muffin batter and baked, or 
stirred into ice-cream when the dasher is removed, 
or poured over ice-cream when it is served. Many 
other ways will suggest themselves. 

Fruit Mac^doine 

It often happens that a little fresh fruit is al- 
lowed to spoil because there is not enough to go

round again. Instead of this two or more kinds 
may be mixed together very acceptably. The 
following make good combinations: strawberries 
and pineapple; raspberries, currants, and a few 
pitted cherries; huckleberries and a few currants; 
peaches and pineapple ; pears and peaches ; orange, 
grape-fruit, and banana. Keep the left-overs very 
cold and carefully, to avoid a " mussy " appearance, 
and serve again promptly. 

Stewed-Fruit Macedoine 

A small portion of several fruits, particularly 
berries, may be stewed together, into an excellent 
sauce. The following are good combinations: 
cranberries and a few raisins; rhubarb and huckle- 
berries; raspberries and currants; huckleberries 
and currants. Avoid long cooking of any of these, 
as it dissipates the flavor. 

Apricot Sauce 

Beat powdered sugar, apricot-juice, and pieces 
of fruit together. Whip white of an egg very 
light, and add to beaten fruit and sugar, or add 
fruit gradually to unbeaten egg white, and beat 
some minutes. Sauce made in second way will 
stand longer. Different fruits may be used.

Cut a few bits of cheese into neat cubes. Chop 
six or eight olives. Break a few English walnuts 
in suitable-sized pieces. Remove the skin and 
seeds from a bunch of white grapes, if at hand. 
Slice a banana or orange. Cut one or two small 
sweet pickles in thin slivers. Mix all lightly to- 
gether. Take four fair red apples. Polish them 
well, cut a thick slice from the stem end and take 
out the core and most of the apple part, so as to 
form a cup. Mix the salad with a little mayon- 
naise, and serve in the apples, replacing the slice 
on top.

spoonfuls of the macaroons and set away to chill. 
Put a tablespoonful of any juicy fresh or canned 
fruit in small glasses, pile the whip lightly on top, 
and sprinkle with the remainder of the macaroons. 

Grape-fruit Served in Slices 

One large grape-fruit can be made to serve four 
people at luncheon by cutting it into thick slices 
like a watermelon, removing the fibrous core in the 
center and filling the space with any fresh fruit 
at hand, such as strawberries, peaches, or shredded 
pineapple. Have all well chilled before serving.

sift together one cup of flour, two teaspoonfuls 
of baking-powder, and one-eighth teaspoonful of 
salt. Beat up one egg, add to it about two table- 
spoonfuls of milk, and stir lightly into the dry ma- 
terials. There should be just liquid enough to 
wet the flour, and make a very stiff dough. Drop 
by spoonfuls into the boiling huckleberries, cover 
tightly, and boil ten minutes without removing the 
cover. Serve at once. A mixture of huckleberries 
and currants may be used, and the vinegar omitted.

Hasty Huckleberry Pudding 

Take fotir slices of cut bread that has not be- 
come dry. Butter the slices on both sides. Place 
one each in individual sauce-dishes. Grate a very 
little nutmeg on the top of each, and pour over 
enough warm, stewed huckleberries to moisten and 
well cover. 

Lemon Gups for Dressings 

When making lemonade save the best skins by 
putting them at once in cold water. In this way 
they will keep for several days, and are nice to use 
in serving salad dressings with lettuce salad, or 
cocktail sauce with oysters or clams, or cold Hol- 
landaise sauce with fish. 

Lemon Syrup for Lemonade 

Do not allow an accumidated supply of lemons 
to dry up or mold. They can be made into syrup 
which will keep for some time, and which can be 
used for lemonade by simply adding water. To 
make syrup, boil a cup of sugar with one-quarter 
cup of water until it threads. Add to this the 
juice and pulp of six lemons and the grated rind 
of two, being careful to grate only the thin yellow 
part. Let all scald together, but do not boil. 
Strain and bottle. 

Peach Tapioca 

Soak one-half cup of granulated tapioca in one 

and one-half cups of cold water over night. In 

the morning add two cups of boiling water and a 

little salt, and let it boil five minutes. Then put 

204 



FRUIT 



into a double boiler and cook until clear. Take the 
remnants of a can of peaches — there should be at 
least a cup, and if there is a pit or two all the 
better. Add a little more sugar, and simmer until 
the syrup is somewhat thickened, and stir into the 
cleared tapioca. Remove from the fire, cool, and 
pour into a glass dish. Serve with sweetened 
cream. 

Peach Sauce 

When preserving peaches take the broken pieces 
and halves not perfect enough for putting in jars 
and make a sauce of them. Add vinegar, clove, 
cinnamon, and sugar, and boil all together until of 
the right consistency. 

Peach Pudding 

I cup flour 2 tablespoonfuls but- 
J cup sugar ter 

J cup milk 2 teaspoonfuls baking-

milk, and flour and baking-powder sifted together. 
Put a layer of peaches in a buttered baking-dish, 
pour the batter over, and bake. Serve with cream 
and sugar, or sweet sauce. Other fruits may be 
used instead of peaches. 

Sauce of Mixed Fruit 

One or two kinds of stewed fruits added to a tart 
stewed plum sauce will improve it and give variety. 
Rub the sauce through a strainer, add to it two 
205 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

or three Bartlett pears (cut fine and stewed until 
tender in a very little water), and a few tablespoon- 
fuls of left-over apple sauce. Sweeten and cook 
together until the flavors of the fruits are well 
blended and the sauce has thickened slightly. 

Fruit Sago (from Syrup Left from Canning) 

In canning berries there is often a quantity of 
fruit syrup left over. Take a pint of any kind at 
hand, but raspberry or raspberry and ctirrant 
particularly recommended, and stir into it when 
boiling three tablespoonfuls of sago that has been 
soaked in cold water several hours. Add more 
sugar if necessary and a little salt, and cook in a 
double boiler until the sago is soft. Pour in a 
mold and chill. This can be served with a little 
fresh fruit or with sweetened cream. 

Fruit Whip 

Put a little jelly or preserve in the bottom of 
lemonade glasses. Fill up with sweetened and 
flavored whipped cream. May be served as an 
evening dessert with light cakes. 

Individual Sliortcakes with Stewed Fruit 

Measiu-e a pint of sifted flour. Sift with it two 
tablespoonfuls sugar, half a teaspoonful salt, and 
four scant teaspoonfuls baking-powder. Cut into 
the mixture one-fourth cup shortening (equal parts 
butter and chicken fat or beef dripping may be 
used). Make a soft dough with about three- 
fourths of a cup of milk. Bake in small tins, 
split after baking, butter the halves and spread 
tJetween ^n4 on top any left-over stewe4 or panne4 
?9§ 



FRUIT 



fruits such as peaches, apricots, blackberries, or cur- 
rants. Small amounts may be used, varying the 
filling if there is not enough of one kind to go 
around, or a meringue may be made, for the top, 
of the beaten whites of two eggs sweetened with 
three tablespoonfuls powdered sugar and flavored 
with lemon-juice. 

Orange Peel 
Do not make a practice of throwing away the 
skins of oranges. The grated yellow rind makes 
a good flavoring for cakes, candies, pudding sauces, 
and icings, and is much cheaper than extracts. 

Candied Orange Peel 

Cut the peel of three or four oranges into narrow 
strips and soak it twenty-four hours in enough 
cold water to cover, adding two tablespoonfuls of 
salt to each quart of water used. Pour off the salt 
water and rinse very thoroughly. Cover with fresh 
cold water and boil until almost tender. Make a 
syrup of two cups of sugar and one and one- 
quarter cups of water. When it boils add the 
orange peel and simmer gently until it looks clear 
and the syrup has thickened. Take out a few 
pieces at a time with a fork, roll in granulated 
sugar, and spread on a flat platter. Or it may 
be dried in the oven with the door open, packed 
in glass jars, and used for mince pies, puddings, 
etc., cut in small bits. If any syrup remains it 
can be used a second time, or it will flavor a 
pudding sauce. 

Orange Baskets 

When the pulp of oranges is to be served in 
small pieces, or the juice alone used, cut the peel 
207 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

in the form of baskets with a handle half an inch 
wide, and with a spoon carefully remove the pulp. 
Put the baskets at once into cold water and they 
will keep fresh for several days. Use them for 
serving orange sponge, lemon jelly, or a fruit blanc 
mange. An orange sponge may be attractively 
served to an invalid in this way. For the sponge 
take the juice of a medium-sized orange, strain it, 
add two teaspoonfuls of sugar, and stir until dis- 
solved. Add two teaspoonfuls of cold water to 
one teaspoonful of granulated gelatine. When 
softened melt over hot water and add to the orange- 
juice with a few drops of lemon-juice. Set on ice 
until it begins to harden around the edge of the 
bowl, then beat with a Dover beater until the 
mass is thick and spongy. Chill again and pile 
lightly in the orange basket after it has been well 
dried. 

Russian Tea 

Add a slice of lemon and a little preserve — straw- 
berry, raspberry, etc., to tea, served hot in glasses. 

Watermelon Balls 

Any watermelon left over can be attractively 
served as a breakfast fruit by cutting it into 
perfectly round balls with a vegetable scoop, or if 
this is not at hand, cut the pulp out with a dessert- 
spoon into oval-shaped pieces, chill, and serve very 
cold.

WHAT TO DO WITH LEFT-OVER 
BEVERAGES 



It is always well to measure coffee and tea when 
preparing them for the table, so there shall be no 
left-overs. But there are occasions when a re- 
mainder is unavoidable. In those cases do not 
allow the liquid to stand on the grounds, but pour 
it off as soon as the meal is over. As for grape- 
juice, it spoils very quickly after a bottle is opened, 
so it should be used promptly. 

Iced Coffee with Milk 

Strain the coffee carefully so there are no 
grounds. Mix with it an equal quantity of rich 
sweet milk and sweeten as desired, stirring until 
the sugar is entirely dissolved. Let it get very 
cold before serving. 

Coffee Jelly 

I cup good clear coffee 3 tablespoonfuls cold 
^ cup rich milk water 

^ cup boiling water i tablespoonful granu- 
4 tablespoonfuls sugar lated gelatine 

A little salt 
213 



THE COOK BOOK OP LEFT-OVERS 

Soak the gelatine in the cold water until softened. 
Add the boiling water and stir until the gelatine 
is dissolved. Mix the coffee, milk, sugar, and 
salt together, and add them to the gelatine. Pour 
into a mold and set away to harden. Serve with 
whipped or plain sweetened cream and sprinkle 
the top with rolled macaroon-crumbs. If there is 
no cream, serve it with sliced bananas toned up 
with a little tart fruit-juice. 

Clear Coffee Jelly 

i§ tablespoonf uls 3 tablespoonfuls sugar 

gelatine i cup clear coffee 

i cup cold water Few drops lemon-juice 

^ cup boiling water Sliced bananas 

Soak gelatine in cold water, melt in boiling water, 
add sugar, coffee, and lemon-juice. When partly 
stiffened stir in slices of banana. Mold and serve 
with rich milk or whipped cream slightly sweetened. 

Coffee Blanc Mange 

3 cups scalded milk 5 tablespoonfuls corn- 
I cup strong coffee starch 

^ cup. sugar i teaspoonful butter 

Salt 

Blend com-starch with some of the cold coffee, 
stir with remainder into scalded milk, add sugar 
and sprinkling of salt. Cook in double boiler five 
minutes, then over fire until corn-starch boils. 
Stir in butter just before taking up. This quantity 
of corn-starch, level measurement, makes a very 
delicate blanc mange. If preferred firmer, use six 
tablespoonfuls corn-starch. 
214 



BEVERAGES 



Coffee Ice-cream (from Custard) 

To two cups of left-over or fresh custard add 
one-half cup of good strong coffee and one-half cup

shaved yellow rind of the lemons. Add a pint of 
cold tea (more if liked), currant, raspberry, or 
grape juice, pieces of shredded pineapple (canned 
or fresh), and sections of oranges. Add more 
sugar if necessary and pieces of ice. Pour in a 
bottle of ApoUinaris or Vichy just before serving. 

Tea Punch No. 2

once, and if extra strong dilute with a little boil- 
ing water run through the teapot. To a quart of 
such liquid add one-half cup of lemon-juice, and 
sugar to sweeten as desired. Stir until the sugar 
is entirely dissolved. Remove the rind and bitter 
white portion from one small orange, cut into thin 
slices, and each slice into quarter sections. Add 
this to the tea and set away to get very cold. 

Cocoa Filling for Cake 

Left-over cocoa can easily be made into a filling 
for cake by adding, two tablespoonf uls of dissolved 
arrowroot to one cup of cocoa, reheating to the 
boiling-point, adding more sugar if necessary, the 
yolk of one egg, slightly beaten, and a little salt. 
Remove from the fire as soon as the egg is added. 
When nearly cool add one-half teaspoonful of 
vanilla and spread between the layers.

ice, and when it begins to harden around the edge 
of the bowl, beat with a Dover beater until the 
mass becomes thickened. Then fold into it the 
stiffly beaten white of one egg, to which have been 
added the salt, lemon-juice, and one tablespoon-

between them. Lay in a deep dish and heap full 
of whipped cream. 

Banana- and Jam-Pudding 

In a buttered earthen baking - dish slice four 
good-sized bananas. Sprinkle them lightly with 
lemon-juice, and cover them with a layer of any 
kind of tart jam. Cream one tablespoonful of 
butter with four tablespoonfuls of sugar, and add 
the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, one cup of 
milk, and one cup of fine stale cake-crumbs, and 
a little salt. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites of 
the two eggs and pour the mixture over the 
bananas and jam. Bake in a moderate oven

stiff, add three tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, 
and beat in enough berries to flavor and color. 
Heap on cake and serve with cream.

DAINTY DISHES FROM LITTLE BITS 



Sandwiches 

It IS sometimes advisable to utilize the cut slices 
of fresh bread that are left over by making them 
into sandwiches at once, and serving them the 
same day, rather than putting them in the bread- 
box and running the risk of overlooking them. 
Pack them in a bowl, cover with a napkin dip- 
ped in hot water and wrung out very dry, and 
put a plate over them. This will keep them per- 
fectly fresh for some hours. Many little dainty 
bits can be used in their preparation. The follow- 
ing combinations will be found acceptable: 

No. 1 

Make a paste of cooked chicken livers with melted 
butter. Add lemon-juice, cayenne, salt, and 
chopped olives. Spread between thin slices of 
white bread. These sandwiches are good without 
the olives. 

No. 2 

Moisten flaked smoked whitefish with butter, 
add chopped sour cucumber pickles, season with 
mustard paste and a dash of cayenne, and use as 
a sandwich filling with white bread. 
231 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEFT-OVERS 

No. 3 

Finely minced salmon and cucumber mixed with 
salad dressing. 

No. 4 

Sardines and hard-cooked egg yolk. Remove the 
skin and bones from the sardines, mash them to a 
paste with the egg, and season with salt, pepper, 
ind a little lemon-juice. 

No. 5 

Equal quantities of grated cheese and butter 
creamed together. Spread this on the bread and 
sprinkle with minced watercress. 

No. 6 

Finely chopped peanuts and celery mixed with 
salad dressing. 

No. 7 

Mix well together chopped nuts and raisins and 
a little lemon-juice. Heat through, let cool, and 
spread on Graham crackers. Press together lightly, 
and crisp in moderate oven. 



A Use for Left-over Fondant 

In making candy from fondant, put aside all 
scrapings from utensils used. These will keep 
indefinitely in a covered glass jar in cool, dry 
place, and when melted with a very little hot 
water, make good icing for small cakes, etc. No 
strong flavors, as peppermint or wintergreen, 
should be used. 

Filling for Tarts 

Take any odds and ends in the way of jelly, 
preserves, stewed fruit cut in small pieces, pudding 
232 



DAINTY DISHES FROM LITTLE BITS 

sauces, bits of orange, cake-crumbs (dried for use 
as bread is dried). Combine to taste; do not 
have any one ingredient predominate, as there 
should be an indefinite flavor. Sweeten if neces- 
sary; if too sweet add lemon-juice. Cook in double 
boiler until it is of right consistency and looks 
rich. This mixture will keep two or three weeks 
if kept covered in a glass jar in a cool place. 

For the pastry use rule for "Plain Pastry for 
Four Patty Pies" (see page 27), increasing the 
shortening to half as much again. 

Jerusalem Pudding 

f tablespoonful gela- Walnuts, figs, dates, 
tine half a cup together 

^ cup boiling water J teaspoonful vanilla 

^ cup cold water J pint heavy cream 

I tablespoonful cook- i cup powdered sugar 
ed rice (dry) 

Soak gelatine in cold water, when softened dis- 
solve in hot water. Scald fruit, chop with nuts, 
and add with rice (beaten soft) to gelatine. Whip 
cream stiff, flavor, sweeten, and fold lightly into 
gelatine mixture. Place in ice-box. Serve very 
cold, turned out into glass dish. 

Frosted Chocolate (from Left-over Ice-cream) 

Add milk or cream and bits of ice to any left- 
over chocolate ice-cream. Serve in glasses. The 
custard should always be turned out from the 
freezer can, kept as cold as possible, and used the 
same day. 

233 



THE COOK BOOK OF LEPT-OVERS 

Marguerites from Left-over Icing 

If it happens that there is any boiled icing of 
any sort left over, set it at once in hot water so it 
will not harden. Cut two marshmallows in small 
pieces and stir them into the warm icing. Pre- 
pare a few chopped nuts and add them, together 
with a little shredded cocoanut. Drop by tea- 
spoonfuls on saltines or zephyr crackers, and 
brown delicately in the oven. 

Dates Stuffed with Left-over Icing 

Add enough more confectioner's sugar to any 
left-over uncooked icing to make it quite stiff, 
flavor it with a little more lemon-juice or vanilla, 
and mix in a few chopped peanuts. Stuff the 
dates with this mixture. 

Meringues (from Left-over Pie Crust) 

Roll bits of pie crust rather thin, cut in domino 
shapes, prick slightly and bake. Spread thickly 
with any kind of jam or marmalade. Beat the 
white of an egg to a stiff froth, adding one table- 
spoonful of sugar and a little lemon-juice while 
beating, pile on the top, and brown lightly in the 
oven.
