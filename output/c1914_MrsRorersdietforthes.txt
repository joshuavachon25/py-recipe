PART THREE 
PHYSICIANS' READY REFERENCE LIST 



FOREWORD 

This book has been written especially for the sick. The 
foods here recommended for special diseases are not suited 
to the well. A person in perfect health must simply repair 
the tissues of the body with proper foods, every twenty- 
four hours; but when ill, the first object is to regain health, 
with a special diet suited to the disease. Simple, easily 
digested foods recommended for the sick are not necessarily 
good for even children or invalids; in fact, foods for the 
well and foods for the sick are not interchangeable. 

My sole desire in writing this book has been to assist 
those persons who must care for their sick at home, and the 
doctor and the nurse, without trespassing on the domain of 
either. In disease each case requires special attention, and 
the knowledge that comes from observation cannot be. sup- 
planted by any dictated rules. Book directions are valueless 
unless modified by common sense. 

I have purposely avoided the caloric plan of feeding, 
as I find many physicians who object to this theoretical and 
mathematical method of feeding, especially in diseases of 
the stomach and intestines. 

As an assistance to my thirty years' experience in 
feeding the sick, I have read most of the recent works on 
diet, and have added any new ideas that have been well 
tried out. The lists of foods given for each disease may be 
depended upon for ordinary cases, but each case must be 
watched carefully and the food changed if it does not agree. 
The value of a thorough acquaintance with the facts and the 
requirements of each individual disease cannot be too highly 
estimated. 

(7) 



8 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Bartholow says : "The food supplied to the organism 
may be so managed as to secure very definite therapeutical 
results, and by employment of a special and restricted 
method of feeding, cures may be effected not attainable by 
medicinal treatment." 



A WORD TO THE WISE 

As food is the most important of our wants, it is wise 
to say a word about diet in health before we discuss diet 
in disease. 

"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." 

Food requirements vary with the occupation, climate 
and method of life, but a general outline may be followed 
by all healthy, right living persons. 

Do not place too much dependence on individual opin- 
ions. Startling announcements are every now and then 
made that some one form of food has produced a wonderful 
cure, or has made persons very ill. These statements are, 
as a rule, exaggerated, and many of them are advertise- 
ments for patented foods. 

Do not go off on a tangent and follow every new line 
of diet that is recommended. Stop, look, and listen, before 
you cross the road of the faddist. A correct diet must 
contain all the nutritive elements of the body in proper 
proportions protein, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, water 
and air. 

Study the chemical elements of the body, and the 
natural foods that will best feed these elements. Do not 
think too much about your food, and never talk of it at 
table. Keep your mind free from fear, and do not imagine 
that you have indigestion simply because you feel uncom- 
fortable after eating; you probably have eaten too much. 

It is not the amount of food one eats that builds the 
body, but it is that which is digested and assimilated. Cease 
eating before you have a sensation of fullness; distention 
of the stomach frequently makes digestion lax, and over- 
taxes the heart and excretory organs. 

One must enjoy food in order to have it do its best 
work; one's table must be in harmony with one's self. 

Eat just enough, but not an ounce too much. "Keep 
the patient well nourished" has taken many a person out of 

(9) 



10 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

the world who might have lived comfortably for many 
years on a slim diet or a partial fast during an illness. A 
loss of appetite is Nature's way of saying: "fast." Give 
thought to your food in selection, cooking and combina- 
tions. Variety is necessary to keep up the appetite and 
produce health. 

Do not live, for instance, every day in the year, on 
roasted meat and mashed potatoes. If your neighborhood 
does not give full markets, change the accessible foods by 
different methods of cooking. For instance, beef may be 
broiled, roasted, baked, stewed, rolled, spiced, chopped and 
made into twenty different dishes, and still it is all beef. 

Do not eat unhealthful combinations. Flour, fruit and 
butter are excellent foods in their places, but when made 
into complicated puddings or pies, are difficult of digestion. 
Time, money and health have been wasted. 

Do not cater to habits ; they are blots upon your char- 
acter; get rid of them as soon as possible. If your father 
and mother had them, so much the greater need for you 
to struggle against them, that the next generation may 
start life without a handicap. 

Do not make excuses. Nature knows nothing of 'cir- 
cumstances. Her laws are harmonious, and if they are 
broken, you must pay the penalty. She never forgets, nor 
does she forgive bodily abuses. Knowledge is one thing, 
but the intelligence that puts knowledge into practice is 
quite another thing. Be intelligent. 

Do not eat when tired. 

Masticate thoroughly every mouthful of food, solid 
or liquid. . 

Masticate all hard foods until they are soft; do not 
soften them with liquids. 

If your digestion is already impaired, bring it back to 
its natural condition by selecting proper food, with not too 
great a variety at one meal. Good results are obtained 
from eating meat at one meal, and starches at another. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 11 

Avoid all fried foods ; the frying pan is a remnant of 
barbarism. 

Life and vigor do not depend on the amount of meat 
one eats. 

It is far easier to keep well than to allow one's self to 
run down, become ill, and then try by a curative diet and 
drugs to get back to the right road. 

The dietary of the so-called civilized people of the 
world, has come largely from the teachings of convenience 
and instinct. Primitive man must have thought little about 
the question of dietetics. He probably knew nothing of 
food values, and like the Eskimo ate and drank that which 
was accessible, and consumed enough to keep up activity 
and health. Can any student of dietetics truly say that 
we, in this twentieth century of learning, with all our 
experiments and knowledge, have thought out or taught 
a better method? Even among the learned, the palate is 
still the guide, and "I like" or "I do not like" plays the 
most important part in the daily bills of fare. The animal 
of our existence is still prominent, and what we call natural 
instinct or natural tastes have been largely influenced by 
our parents and conditions of life. 

Modern dietitians argue that a diet composed largely 
of lean meats is best for the business man, and a vege- 
table diet is best suited to the outdoor laborer. Examina- 
tions, however, prove that the average United States busi- 
ness man breaks down between the ages of forty and fifty, 
with diseases that come from an over-nitrogenous diet. If 
the organs of the body are made to do the work in forty 
years instead of in eighty, as planned by Nature, a man 
at forty is eighty years old. We have been told over and 
over again that "man is as old as his arteries, digestive 
and excretory organs." A man is what he eats, and the 
diet he selects is the measure of his intelligence. 

We have been teaching diet, cookery and methods of 
serving in all our public schools for thirty years. Have you 
noticed any great change in the family tables of the masses? 



12 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Have the fried pork and fried potatoes been replaced by 
carefully selected and broiled meats? Have the fruits been 
served in perfection, or are they still stewed with sugar 
for hours? Are the dining-rooms artistic and restful, or are 
they still semi-barbaric? I see but little change, and I do 
not believe that we can reach our highest attainments with- 
out being artistic and learned in all branches that pertain 
to life and living. 

A very young child can easily be taught the needs of 
the body and how to select a general diet. One need not 
necessarily weigh or measure every mouthful of food nor 
give hours to the thought and preparation of a meal at the 
expense of every other thing in life. 

Serve every meal, three times a day, three hundred and 
sixty-five days a year, in a simple, artistic fashion. Sit 
down, eat slowly and comfortably, and enjoy it. Eat to 
live. Health is always worth while. 

A little reading and a few weeks' good study will 
enable any housewife to create from the materials at hand, 
acceptable bills of fare. She must first learn combinations 
that go to form a balanced ration. She may have fat pork 
and beans, lean beef and potatoes, desserts made from 
starchy foods and fruits, but not eggs and milk, after a meat 
dinner. Bread and butter, not bread and molasses. Meat, 
potatoes and cauliflower or cabbage, npt meat, potatoes and 
rice. One starchy food, one green vegetable, one nitroge- 
nous dish. A puree of lentils, with baked potato and 
tomato salad, with bread and butter, form a complete 
meal. Beef or mutton, 'following puree of lentils, upsets 
the balance and gives too much nitrogenous food. 

Use plenty of pure -cold water; take it at the end of 
the meal, and drink it freely between meals. Do not wash 
your foods down with slops tea and coffee saturated with 
sugar and milk. 

If you have aches and pains, stop and think what 
natural law you have violated. When you discover the 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 13 

error, avoid it at another time, for simple errors, repeated 
frequently, produce incurable diseases. 

The Bath Bathe every day in cold or tepid water, and 
rub thoroughly! to keep the skin active. Live and sleep in 
the open air. I have frequently noticed that persons who 
are afraid of air are unhygienic and uncleanly in other 
respects. 

Appetite The true natural appetite is a calling of the 
tissues of the body for sustenance, not the gnawing of an 
ill-fed stomach. When one is constantly overfed, naturally 
the appetite flags. A fast of three or four days, drinking 
plenty of water, will bring about satisfactory results. 

Do not tempt the appetite when it flags ; give it a rest. 

Do not resort to tonics or stimulants, for in nine out 
of ten cases, the pricking up of a flagging appetite is 
dangerous. Natural conditions are cast aside ; tonics, 
stimulants and appetizing foods are temptations. Appe- 
tites thus created are. unnatural; you overtax your digestion 
and are now really sick not because you ought to be, 
but because you have not listened to Nature's warning. 

Light breakfasts are always desirable ; they prevent 
the appetite from flagging. A cup of black coffee, early in 
the morning, with no food until twelve o'clock, is an excel- 
lent cure. The "torpid liver" becomes active, and the ever- 
present headache disappears. Cut off all sweets at the end 
of meals. Do not drink tea and coffee, except the one cup 
early in the morning. Do not eat until food tastes good. 
One can take the "appetite cure," as well as the "tubercu- 
losis cure," within the four walls of his own home, if 
he will only obey Nature's calling. Use the money spent 
for traveling, on food and conveniences, and cures will 
come easily. There never was a more foolish fashion than 
trying to get well traveling from pillar to post. Stay in 
comforta'ble quarters, build your own outdoor sleeping 
rooms, and later you may take a journey for pleasure, not 
for health. 



14 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Avoid pies, cakes, preserves, dishes of rich meats, 
highly-seasoned sauces and soups. A half pint of hot, 
scalded, not boiled, milk, sipped before going to bed, will 
relieve hunger and induce sleep. 

As a rule, foods that are pleasant to the palate, and 
do not give discomfort, are not injurious. This does not 
mean that the nurse or caretaker must listen to the notions 
of the sick: Even in health, habit and early training decide 
the appetite. The mother likes and dislikes things, and 
in bringing up her children she teaches them her own short- 
comings. 

Sightly foods, with pleasant odors, nicely served, fre- 
quently induce a patient to eat, but as a rule, the sick will 
never overeat unless they are mentally deranged. Com- 
plete satisfaction of the appetite comes from the stomach, 
not from the palate. Palate appetites frequently create 
disturbances which complicate after feedings. The sick, 
more than the well, take note of results, and when once 
overfed they mark the discomfort and remember it, and 
frequently refuse even plain foods that heretofore were 
acceptable. 

Monotony will destroy even a good appetite. When 
only one or two articles are admissible, change the flavor 
by some simple method. Seek new ways of serving; use 
new flowers for decorations; change the china in the 
service. Even a new doily, or a new tray, will attract 
attention. 

Appetite is a useful, but not an infallible guide to a 
correct diet. 



A FEW GOLDEN RULES 
FOR THOSE WHO FEED THE SICK 

First of all, I should like to impress on the minds of 
the attendants that constant nourishment does not always 
bring about good conditions or cures. 

When the appetite flags, stop feeding. 

Study the case carefully, and give the food indicated by 
the disease. 

If the trouble is acute, give the parts of the body most 
affected by the disease, rest. 

If the trouble is chronic, give the parts most affected 
by the disease, moderately good exercise. 

If a person has tuberculosis, for instance, give a goodly 
quantity of fats and oils, eggs and milk, rich in those ele- 
ments which will give the lungs good healthful exercise. 

Pneumonia, an acute trouble, will recover more quickly 
on skimmed milk, beef tea and foods deficient in fat. 

Acute indigestion can be corrected quickly by a fast 
of two or three days. 

Chronic indigestion calls for foods that require a slight 
effort on the part of the digestive tract to excite the neces- 
sary digestive fluids. 

A diet for the sick is not a normal diet, and is abso- 
lutely unsuited to those in health. 

If the person is very ill, give liquid foods through a 
glass tube or a straw. This will excite a flow of the secre- 
tions of the mouth and aid digestion. 

Forget the isolated facts that you have stored up from 
everyday sayings, and apply common sense to each patient, 
for each is a law unto himself. Do not give four hundred 
calories of food, for instance, if only two hundred can be 
digested. Rigid rules usually have exceptions. 

Never overfeed the sick; it ruins digestion and 
hinders cure. 

(15) 



16 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Arrange all foods in an attractive and dainty manner; 
see that the silver is bright, the china clean, that grease is 
not floating on the top of soups. A cup of unskimmed beef 
tea will frequently upset the patient and destroy a liking 
for all soups. 

Do not overload a dish; it robs a delicate patient of 
his appetite. 

See that all foods are well cooked, well blended and 
nicely garnished. 

Do not speak of the quality of food, nor its character, 
nor what you like, before the patient. Avoid conversations 
about food, especially while the patient is eating. 

While nursing is not the province of this book, I should 
like to say to the nurse: do not dwell on unpleasant con- 
ditions while the patient is eating. A patient disturbed in 
mind cannot get the best results from food. Any excite- 
ment preceding or during the feeding hour will produce 
unfavorable conditions, even if the food is correct. 

Do not think that every ounce of meat your patient 
eats is an ounce of nourishment or strength, for this is a 
great mistake. 

Milk is the most important of all foods for the sick; 
eggs, perhaps, come next, and in some cases fruit juices 
are of first value. 

Do not cram your patient. If the digestive organs are 
over worked, the heart will be affected and the patient 
generally worse : sick people, as a rule, require rest, not 
labor. 

"Keep up the nourishment" has killed many a person. 
"Keep the patient alive on a rational and limited diet" is 
a much wiser saying. 

Do not rely on the patient's judgment. There are 
thousands of misfit palates in the world. 

Do not dish foods before the patient; bring the tray 
complete. If foods must be cooked in the kitchen and 
brought directly to the sick room, the nurse must have 
them placed out of sight of the patient until she can .over- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 17 

look and rearrange the tray. A dish of oatmeal porridge, 
with a little spilled on the outside, will frequently produce 
nausea. 

The sick are supersensitive ; every dish, no matter how 
simple, must be perfectly prepared and well served. 

Remove immediately from the sick room every particle 
of left-over food; do not reheat or serve it again. Do not 
repeat a dish in less than two days, if possible, unless the 
patient is on a milk diet. A mistake of this kind will fre- 
quently rob the patient of appetite and complicate feeding. 
Serve hot foods comfortably hot, on hot dishes, and cold 
foods comfortably cold on cold plates. 

If flowers are used for tray decorations, see that they 
have an agreeable, mild odor; heavy odors frequently 
destroy the appetite. Violets, roses and pansies are to be 
preferred. 



PART I 

DISEASES 



ASTHMA 

This disease usually overtakes those who overeat or 
eat hurriedly, and those who "nibble" between meals. The 
asthmatic patient, as a rule, is not particular as to the 
character of his food, if the quantity pleases his eye. The 
stomach is forever at work, the digestive powers are worn 
out, unnatural fermentations are developed, and the poisons 
formed are taken up by the circulation. The victim be- 
comes exceedingly sensitive to changes in the weather, 
takes cold easily, and is always looking for drafts. 

The great difficulty in the treatment of asthma is that 
the disease travels slowly, and is frequently in the chronic 
stage before medical advice is sought. The disease may 
be cured permanently if medical advice is aided by a cor- 
rect and restricted diet. 

Asthmatic patients must never dissipate; they must 
not overeat. Flatulency and indigestion are the forerun- 
ners of severe attacks, and even after a cure has been 
brought about, such persons can never again eat and drink 
with impunity. Each attack becomes more difficult to cure. 

Air and water are necessary accompaniments to good 
diet. Keep the pores of the skin open ; live in the open 
air both day and night. 

All foods must be cooked without fat. If the patient 
has been accustomed to taking coffee, drink a small cup 
early in the morning before the general breakfast. Green 
vegetables must be crisp, carefully washed and cooked in 
salted water, or served raw with olive oil and a few drops 
of vinegar. All foods must be thoroughly masticated. 

Divide the meals into convenient hours, five a day if 
necessary, three preferable. Use all starchy foods spar- 
ingly.

MRS. RORER'S DI^T FOR THE SICK 25 

TUBERCULOSIS 

Doctor Osier tells us that the cure of tuberculosis is 
largely a question of nutrition ; if one can make the patient 
grow fat, the local disease may be left to care for itself. 
As eggs, cream and milk are easily digested, and are rich 
in fatty matter, we at once turn to these as the all-important 
foods. It was only a few years ago that tuberculosis 
patients were sent to the country, where they might drink 
the milk warm from the cow. There seems to be more 
virtue and more health-giving qualities in milk with the 
natural warmth than in milk artificially heated. 

The cure of tuberculosis depends upon pure air, both 
day and night, and correct nutrition. The disease calls 
for easily-digested fatty matter cream, butter, olive oil, 
marrow, the yolks of eggs. I am speaking now of pulmon- 
ary tuberculosis. From the first the patient must be im- 
pressed that if a cure is to be effected, the given rules must 
be carefully followed, otherwise the race is not worth the 
running. 

The amount of food and the hours of feeding must be 
regulated by the condition of the patient. The writer can- 
not establish rules, as each patient is a law unto himself. Be 
careful, however, not to overeat. On the other hand the ap- 
petite must be kept up by a pleasing, well-served variety of 
food. 

I fully believe that almost any tuberculosis patient, 
not too far gone, can be cured at home, providing he 
will follow directions, better than at the average, poorly- 
managed sanitarium. In many sanitariums too much de- 
pendence is placed on climate and air and too little on 
correct diet. Stay at home, build an outdoor sleeping room, 
wear warm clothing, not necessarily wool linen is prefer- 
able. Take milk and eggs in large quantities between meals. 

To keep up the appetite change the method of serving 
both the eggs and milk. At one time separate the egg, beat 
the yolk, add the white and a little powdered sugar; later 



26 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

drink a glass of milk. At another time, take eggnog; or 
shake the whites of eggs with milk, and use the yolks, 
hard boiled, grated over toast as a supper dish. Do not 
give too much meat ; it is not as nutritious as eggs 
and milk, and nourishment is of cardinal importance. 
Give nut dishes, Brazilian nut butter, cocoanut cream and 
egg occasionally, in the place of cow's milk. Use now and 
then for an afternoon luncheon a cup of well-made chocolate, 
with whipped cream, in place of egg and milk. 

At regular meals give puree of beans, lentils or old 
peas, made with good stock, and thinned with milk or 
cream; or cream soups, well-roasted beef and mutton, 
boiled rice or potato, and hard bread that will require mas- 
tication, breakfast bacon, with eggs, and fruits. 

It is necessary for dispensary nurses, who visit the 
patients at their homes, to select the most suitable from 
foods that are accessible and within their price limit. If 
eggs and cream are expensive, substitute bacon, meat stews, 
hominy, lentils, peanut and bean soup, cornmeal mush, oat- 
meal, milk and suet puddings, and the cheaper fruits, 
stewed prunes and baked bananas. 

Arrange the meals for ordinary patients as follows: 
Early in the morning give a cup of hot milk, flavored with 
strong coffee, no sugar. The patient may rest a half hour, 
then bathe, then rest again for half an hour, and breakfast. 
Give orange juice or other fruit, and a well-cooked cereal 
with cream, or two shirred eggs with two slices of broiled 
bacon and a half ounce of butter on a bit of toast. For 
variety, if the patient is a meat eater, give a couple of 
broiled chops, or a meat cake, or fish, in the place of eggs. 

If breakfast is taken at eight o'clock, at eleven 
give a glass of milk and egg shaken thoroughly together. 
At twelve-thirty or one (be careful not to crowd the 
patient) give puree of lentils, and a slice of zweiback, with 
a half ounce of butter; or broiled meat and a baked potato, 
with cream or butter ; or meat and boiled rice, or carefully- 
boiled hominy grits, or mush bread, with a half ounce of 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 27 

butter; followed by a "heart" of lettuce with olive oil 
and a drop of lemon juice. In the middle of the afternoon, 
give either a bowl of junket, or koumys, or leban, butter- 
milk or zoolak, without other food; or eggs and milk. At 
six o'clock, a bowl of cream soup, with zweiback, well but- 
tered ; a little piece of steak or chop ; a small dish of care- 
fully-cooked macaroni with cream sauce ; a toasted cracker, 
well buttered, and a bit of cheese. At bedtime, a glass of 
modified milk, with a double quantity of cream, or plain 
milk. 

If for any reason the patient should have an attack of 
indigestion, stop all vegetable foods at once and substitute 
modified milk, albumin and milk, chopped meat cakes, and 
whole wheat bread only. Large quantities of foods are 
called for, but if the digestion is upset the whole scheme 
fails. Avoid too great a variety at a meal. 

Do not give preparations to aid digestion; they fre- 
quently upset the stomach and cause a "set back." All 
drugs should be avoided, except those ordered by the physi- 
cian. Do not give cod liver oil unless ordered. Depend 
for your fatty foods on cocoanut cream, milk and eggs, 
olive oil, nut soups, nut milks, especially those made from 
black walnuts and Brazilian nuts. 

The nurse who has charge of tuberculosis patients 
should study carefully the character and idiosyncrasies of 
each patient. Recovery usually follows an increase of 
weight; if the patient loses weight, the road to recovery is 
difficult. Constipation should not be allowed ; foods that 
do not agree should not be repeated. If egg and milk 
disagree, give milk and barley water, or milk with cocoa- 
nut cream. If the taste of milk is disagreeable, change 
its flavor by adding articles recommended under the head- 
ing of "Milk and Milk Preparations," in the Second Part of 
this book. 

The care of the mouth is of great importance. Wash 
a half pound of water cress carefully, pick the leaves from 
the stems, chop them fine, and rub them to a pulp ; stir 



MRS. RORER S DIET FOR THE SICK 



them into a pint of water, add two teaspoonfuls of salt, strain, 
bottle and cork. Use this as a mouth wash once or twice a day. 
It must be made fresh once a week. If cress is not obtain- 
able, Listerine, Glycothymoline, or salt and water are rec- 
ommended. 

The following list may offer suggestions to the care- 
taker :

MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 29 

PNEUMONIA 

Pneumonia, an inflammatory disease of the lungs, 
calls for light stomach-digested foods quite free from fat. 

The fever and weak heart action that are always pres- 
ent must also be taken into account. Give skimmed milk 
shaken with whites of eggs, or plain milk containing not 
over three per cent, of fat. 

Continue this, if it agrees, during the acute stage of 
the disease. Then add, at alternate feedings, beef juice, 
nutritive beef tea, almond milk, strained, once a day. The 
white of egg shaken with skimmed milk, if it is well borne, 
should be continued four times a day until the physician 
orders a change. 

Give no solid foods of any kind and be careful not to 
over feed, as the heart action, already very weak, must not 
be overtaxed. 

During Convalescence Add 

Milk foods such as Beef panada 

Zoolak Bouillon 

Koumys Veal broth, strained 

Matzoon Scraped beef cake 

Sour buttermilk A little milk toast 

Eggs, raw, with milk Zweiback 
Egg, coddled 



TONSILITIS 

In the acute stages of this disease, give egg flip, junket, 
koumys, matzoon, sweetened cream frozen slightly, or choc- 
olate or coffee ice cream, about four ounces at a feeding. 
Lemon and orange gelose. Plain frozen cream may be 
given twice a day. When convalescence begins, give egg- 
nog, laibose, panada, bouillon, beef juice, fruit juices, frozen 
cream, milk with dry albumin, junket, zoolak, buttermilk. 
Later scraped meat cake, ground mutton cake with almond 
meal, gluten mush, aleuronat with cream, raw egg and 
sherry. 



30 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

QUINZY 

Dietetic treatment is the same as for tonsilitis. If the 
patient is anaemic give in the very beginning four raw eggs 
and a quart of milk a day, and four ounces of frozen cream 
twice a day. 



DISEASES OF THE HEART 

There are certain general rules that may be followed 
to a great extent in all cases of cardiac trouble, no matter 
whether the defects are partly counterbalanced or not. It 
is now recognized by all dietitians that the prolific source 
of heart troubles is an irregular mode of life, an unbalanced 
dietary or foods badly cooked. 

The road to relief is by a straight and narrow diet. 
Foods must be well selected, simply cooked and easily 
digested; and a sufficiently long time allowed after each 
meal to digest it thoroughly. Eating between meals must 
be strictly prohibited. Even a glass of water taken long 
after the meal but before digestion is completed may give 
rise to flatulency and produce a paroxysm. All indigestible 
foods, coarse vegetables, dense raw fruits, such meats as 
pork, veal, lobsters, clams, pink-fleshed fish, coarse breads, 
badly-cooked cereals, effervescing drinks, strong tea, coffee 
and chocolate, must be avoided. The stomach must never 
be overloaded or palpitation will occur. 

In each case the digestive capacity of the patient must 
be carefully studied, and each meal must be just enough, 
not an ounce over. Any residue of undigested food remain- 
ing in the stomach and intestines will set up unnatural 
fermentations and again cause flatulency and a paroxysm. 

Palpitation When this occurs stop all solid foods at 
once. The meals have been too heavy, or the patient has 
eaten too much. Give milk, or milk and barley water, 
koumys or matzoon, every two hours, for several days. 
Then add an egg, and go gradually on to the usual spare 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 31 

diet. Persons who have "heart trouble" must never eat 
eggs, milk and meat at the same meal, acid fruit with 
bread or cereals, drink coffee or tea at meals, nor should 
they take soup at the beginning of a meal. All rich sauces, 
salads, cooked fats, sweet dishes and over-starchy dishes 
must be avoided. A baked potato mashed with cream, and 
a little well-cooked dry rice are allowable two or three 
times a week. 

If Edema Occurs Give for several days predigested 
foods, milk, hot peptonized milk, peptonized milk gruels, 
peptonized beef and oysters, or such easily-digested foods 
as plain junket or egg junket, koumys, matzoon or leban. 

Constipation This complication is usually the fore- 
most among the symptoms of heart trouble, and follows 
gastric disturbances. For relief add a tablespoonful of milk 
sugar to a glass of plain milk, or give the juice of two 
oranges, or a small cup of cafe au lait, following a glass of 
water, early in the morning, or a saucer of Roman meal 
mush with cream. Do not give purgatives unless ordered 
by a physician. 



32 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

SENILE HEART 

Most patients with this disease are thin and rather 
lighter in weight than is their usual habit. 

Avoid soups at the beginning of meals. If cream 
soups with bread agree they should form the meal, and 
no other food should follow. From five to six hours 
should be allowed between meals. The heavy meal should 
be taken in the middle of the day. A cup of chocolate 
or Meiggs' food, or any of the sour milk preparations, 
with a bit of bread, make an exceedingly nice supper. All 
indigestible or coarse foods must be avoided. White fish, 
chicken, mutton and boiled beef are the only meats allowed. 
A tablespoonful of boiled rice, or a small baked potato, are 
the admissible starchy foods. Spinach, asparagus tips and 
raw tomato, with olive oil or cocoanut cream, may be taken 
now and then. Bread may be well-baked whole wheat or 
stale white bread. 

Avoid alcohol and all stimulating foods, unless ordered 
by the physician. If the patient is thirsty give a cup of hot 
water, rather than a glass of cold water; or give the juice 
of an orange. 

In arranging meals, give for breakfasts one poached 
or soft-boiled egg, with one slice of hard bread, well but- 
tered. An hour before this, a cup of coffee, half milk, or 
the juice of two oranges. Variation must come from the 
different methods of cooking, as the diet is limited. 

For dinner, the main meal of the day, which should 
be as near noon as possible, unless the breakfast has been 
very late, give any of the meats mentioned, with either a 
little spinach or baked potato. Do not give a green vege- 
table and a starchy vegetable at the same meal. 

Dessert may consist of ripe grapes, or a sliced orange, 
or a simple custard. If the patient feels hungry in the 
middle of the afternoon, give a cup of weak, clear tea, abso- 
lutely alone, with not a mouthful of any other food. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



33 



Supper, which should be not later than half past six 
or seven, may consist of a warm custard with hard toast, 
or toast and milk, or milk toast, or milk and albumin, with 
a crust of bread, or any of the milk preparations. 

When the patient is ready for bed, let him sip slowly 
a cup of hot milk.

ANGINA PECTORIS 

In this disease the stomach must be kept in the best 
possible condition. The food must be just enough, and not 
one ounce too much. Flatulency must be avoided. Like 
many other troubles of the circulatory system, the disten- 
tion of the stomach presses against the diaphragm, and in 
turn against the heart. The heavy meal should be taken 
at noon. Breakfast should be light and composed largely 
of well-cooked cereals and cream, or poached or soft-boiled 
eggs and toast. 

Do not give liquids with meals. If the patient has been 
accustomed to coffee, give a cup of coffee an hour before the 
regular breakfast. Tender boiled, broiled or baked meats 
may be given in moderation. Pork, veal, and such dense 
meats as rabbit, or fatty meats as duck, goose and turkey, 
must be avoided. Fresh fruits and fruit juices are to be 
recommended. Such green vegetables as spinach, well 
cooked, lettuce, or cooked cress and asparagus tips, do 
not, as a rule, cause flatulency. Hot water may be taken 
a half hour before each meal, in the place of soup. The 
patient must avoid all highly-seasoned foods, rich sauces, 
sea foods with the exception of oysters and white-fleshed 
fish, rich desserts, sweets and salads. Unleavened bread, 
or any hard bread that requires mastication, is best. 

If flatulency occurs in the early morning, give the 
patient two tablespoonfuls of clam broth, or two table- 
spoonfuls of moderately strong coffee mixed with four 
tablespoonfuls of milk ; this must be sipped slowly. Some- 
times a cup of hot water will have the desired effect. If 
flatulency is persistent in the mornings, give a cup of hot 
water, and follow with two tablespoonfuls of strained lemon 
juice. Continue this, and the flatulency will usually be 
entirely corrected. 

The patient should never try the second time a food 
that has not agreed at first. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 35 

If constipation occurs, give a scraped apple, or Roman 
meal mush, or four ground almonds. 

A good motto is "Eat less than you- want."

ANEURISM 

This disease calls for a non-stimulating diet. The heart 
beat must be kept even and slow, to lessen as much as pos- 
sible the arterial pressure. . The diet must necessarily be 
rather monotonous, get variety by changing the method of 
service and flavorings. Easily-digested combinations must 
be rigidly enforced. Flatulency is always dangerous. If 
the patient is to be helped without surgical aid, a limited 
diet must be continued for some time. 



BREAKFASTS 

Glass of milk, one-third barley water, sipped slowly ; 
or two ounces of stale bread with four ounces of milk; 
or four ounces of any of the milk gruels; or two ounces 
of fruit juice over a small saucer of dextrinized cereals of 
some sort; or the top of a shredded wheat biscuit, toasted, 
with milk; or the top of a shredded wheat biscuit, toasted, 
with two ounces of grape juice ; or the beaten white of 
egg on orange juice, and a wafer; or the yolk of an egg, 
beaten with four ounces of milk ; or the white of an egg 
thoroughly shaken with six ounces of milk. 

DINNERS 

Two ounces of scraped meat, broiled, with two ounces 
of zweiback, pulled bread or stale bread; or two chops (a 
quarter of a pound) with stale bread ; or a mutton cake (two 
ounces) with stale bread or cracker; or chicken timbale 
(three ounces), stale bread or cracker; or four ounces of 
broiled sweetbread, stale bread or pulled bread; or four 
ounces of cream of potato soup, with one ounce of toast. 

SUPPERS 

Three slices of milk toast (two ounces of bread and 
six ounces of milk) ; or six ounces of gelatin milk ; or two 
ounces of toast, four ounces of hot milk poured over, cov- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 37 

ered with the grated hard-boiled yolk of egg ; or six ounces 
of beef meal gruel, with two ounces of toast. 

If at any time the quantities here given should be more 
than can be easily digested, cut them down. Quantities 
really have no place in a book ; they should be regulated 
by the physician and the nurse. 



APOPLEXY 

Follow the first attack by a fast of two, three or four 
days, as is deemed necessary by the physician. It fre- 
quently becomes necessary to give predigested foods by 
rectum. As this disease often occurs in the obese, absti- 
nence from food for even five days is advantageous. This 
must, however, be done by the physician's orders, and 
under his observation. When the coma has passed and 
the patient can swallow, give predigested, condensed liquid 
foods by teaspoonfuls, and see that each quantity is swal- 
lowed before a second is given, otherwise the patient may 
choke and draw the fluid into the lungs, causing inspi- 
ration pneumonia. As the patient progresses and swallow- 
ing becomes more natural, if there is facial paralysis, keep 
up the concentrated liquid foods. Eggs and milk; puree 
made with milk and vegetables ; cream and milk mixed ; 
"ye perfect food"; rice boiled in milk until tender, and 
pressed through a sieve; rice cooked in chicken broth for 
an hour, and pressed through a sieve; puree of split peas 
may all be given if they can be swallowed. Later, if the 
patient has no facial paralysis, whole wheat bread, baked 
potato, boiled rice, chopped chicken made into a timbale, 
soup a la Reine and scraped mutton cake, are next in order. 
If the patient is constipated, give two ounces of fruit juices 
or almond milk, two or three times a day. All foods must 
be nutritious but non-stimulating. Chicken and a little 
mutton should be the only meats used. The less meat, the 
better. The patient must not overeat. A little cold water, 
early in the morning, and between meals, is advisable. 



38 



MRS. RORER S DIET FOR THE SICK 



Alcoholic liquors should not be given unless ordered by 
a physician. 

If the patient recovers from this attack he must, 
as long as he lives, keep ,up a vegetable diet, substi- 
tuting eggs, nuts and milk for meats. He must eat less 
than the appetite calls for. A "full meal," "just a little 
dissipation," frequently brings on a second and fatal attack.

PERNICIOUS ANAEMIA 

The defective assimilation of proteids seems to be the 
chief obstacle to overcome in the feeding of this disease. 
It is always a question whether those from animal or from 
vegetable foods are more easily assimilated. In a well-known 
sanitarium in this country, pernicious anaemia patients are put 
on a diet rich in proteids, but free from the flesh of animals. 
Milk and eggs, with such vegetables as ground and cooked . 
nuts, and the leguminous seeds, are substituted. The eating 
of fatty foods, butter, cream, cocoanut cream and nut oils, is 
encouraged to the limit of toleration and digestion. 

In severe cases, it is wise at first to predigest all foods 
given. Specially-peptonized milk, milk jelly and milk 
punch are to be preferred. If starches are given, arrow- 
root, rice flour and potato flour cooked in milk, are best, 
and they should be given alone, between meals. Home- 
made pemmican is a food par excellence in this disease. 
The marrow must be taken from the long beef bones, and 
if the patient refuses to eat it raw, it may be boiled and then

ANEMIA (CHLOROSIS) 

Acute anaemia arising from hemorrhage, needs the im- 
mediate care of a physician and is not considered here. 

These directions are for the "anaemic girl," who is fre- 
quently neglected and becomes a chronic invalid before any 
one realizes she is ill. 

The body is properly nourished when the condition and 
circulation of the blood are good. In anaemia the blood becomes 
thin and watery, impoverished in red corpuscles, and while 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 41 

this is not a true disease in the minds of many persons, it is 
certainly a sign of a serious trouble near at hand that calls for 
immediate and special treatment. 

Young girls coming into womanhood are frequently over- 
taxed by a multiplicity of duties and social engagements. 
Hard study frequently lasts into the night and robs her of the 
proper rest and outdoor physical exercise. Indoor exercise, 
even if taken in a well-ventilated room, does not take the place 
of the outdoor romp. She eats candy before going to bed 
and frequently sleeps in the same room in which she has 
studied and without changing the air. She is simply under- 
going a slow process of poisoning. Headaches, lassitude, 
and indifference to things in general, are the first symptoms 
of "the breakdown." She is not hungry in the morning; but 
our present school system makes it obligatory for her to eat 
when breakfast is on the table, at a regular and early hour. 
She is criticised if she does not eat, so she eats and carries 
the food in her stomach, undigested, until luncheon time. 
This is the first step to serious digestive troubles. To allay 
the craving of her stomach she eats pickles, lemons, candy, 
salt, any unnatural thing she can find and keep in her room. 
Doctor Fothergill tells us, "Health is a long price to pay for 
education, and our modern system of feeding, in both boys' 
and girls' schools, kills off the weak, ruins the middling 
and makes invalids of the well." 

Another type is found among the society girls, whose 
physical foundations have been neglected from early childhood. 

Treatment for anaemia must continue until there is a 
perfect recovery. Rest is necessary ; early to bed and late 
to rise is a good motto. In the morning, brush the teeth 
and drink slowly a glass of milk or a cup of cafe au lait, 
before arising. Rest two hours, then take a sponge bath, 
with a thorough rub. Rest a half hour, then eat breakfast 
composed of two soft-boiled eggs and a bit of toast; or a 
dish of beauregard eggs ; or golden toast ; or a scraped beef 
cake, broiled ; or two eggs with a slice of whole wheat bread 
well buttered; or oatmeal or cornmeal mush with cream; 



42 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

or poached eggs on broiled bacon or toast; or a broiled 
chop, with creamed potato. 

The noonday meal should consist of concentrated 
foods, broiled steak, chop or chicken, baked potato or boiled 
rice, eggs, except fried or hard boiled, tender hearts of 
lettuce with French dressing. Between dinner and supper 
give a glass of milk, quarter cream ; for the sake of variety 
this may be alternated with koumys or zoolak. 

For supper give cream toast; whole wheat bread well 
buttered, with sliced tomato covered with cocoanut cream ; 
old-fashioned rice puddings ; Wheatena and cream ; dates 
and milk ; corn bread, or baked apples and cream with hard 
bread ; stewed prunes with rice and cream ; steamed figs 
with cream and corn gems ; or a bowl of cream soup with 
whole wheat bread. 

At the close of the noonday meal, if a salad is not eaten, 
sip slowly, almost drop by drop, a teaspoonful of olive oil, 
and eat, masticating thoroughly, six blanched and dried, 
not toasted, almonds. 

Anaemic girls frequently continue in their lassitude 
until they can assimilate a goodly quantity of easily-digested 
proteids and raw fats such as butter, cream, cocoanut cream 
and olive oil. However, they must avoid fat meats; to be 
palatable and wholesome the fats of meat must be cooked, 
and heat renders fats less liable to agree with a delicate 
stomach. Bacon is the exception ; if it is relished, give two 
slices every other morning. It is an agreeable addition 
to poached eggs on toast. 

If olive oil cannot be taken from the spoon, make it 
into French dressing with a few drops of lemon juice, and 
use it over tender lettuce, imported endive, tender celery, 
cold, carefully-cooked spinach, string beans, or cress. 

Plenty of fresh air without violent exercise is of equal 
importance with correct diet. A short walk each day is to 
be recommended. In walking, hold the body erect, draw 
the abdomen in, put the ball of the foot first to the ground. 
The clothing must be loose, light, warm and suspended 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 43 

from the shoulders. Skirts should be of light material, 
wool preferably; they should be comfortably narrow and 
short, and buttoned to the bottom of a loose waist or corset. 
Shoes must fit the feet, and have broad soles and low, broad 
heels. Gloves should be sufficiently loose not to press the 
circulation at the wrist. 

Under no circumstances must the patient become 
weary ; better spend all day in a hammock in the open air 
than have a moment's fatigue. 

Avoid bulk foods ; the appetite becomes satisfied before 
a sufficient amount of food has been eaten. If the appetite 
flags, and it usually does in the early morning, give the 
juice of two oranges, or two ounces of good percolated 
coffee with two ounces of hot milk; these are light and 
desirable stimulants. Some authorities object to coffee, 
but the writer can see no harm in a cup of good coffee, 
taken alone in the morning. 

In cases where anaemic conditions are of long standing, 
a selected diet must be continued for months.

DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

In all diseases of the stomach cures are effected by 
diet that are quite unattainable by drugs. No absolute rules 
can be formulated that will enable people to cure them- 
selves. The term "dyspepsia" is used to cover a multitude 
of sins ; in fact, every pain in the stomach or discomfort after 
eating is called by most persons dyspepsia or "indigestion." 
Food is correct, as a rule, when it produces no discomfort 
in the stomach and passes into the intestines without creat- 
ing gas and flatulency. "Intestinal indigestion" starch 
indigestion is by far the most common among the people 
of the United States, and is perhaps most easily cured. 
Gastric troubles are much more difficult to regulate, as 
almost invariably the motor, as well as the secretory action, 
is impaired. In such cases the food eaten must be most 
easily digested and yet it must be very nutritious. 

Dyspeptics like rheumatics are found in two classes : 
the hearty eater who lives on rich foods until the digestive 
powers are over taxed, and the "moderate" eater, who eats 
toast, tea, fruits stewed with sugar, fried meats, fried pota- 
toes, pies and layer cakes, which for some unknown reason 
he considers a simple diet. The latter class are by far the 
morg difficult to cure. The first class are, as a rule, greatly 
benefited by a fast for two or three days, then a milk diet 
for two weeks, coming back gradually to a normal diet, 
composed of milk soups, stale breads, chopped broiled beef, 
and simple well-cooked green vegetables. 

The second class will do well to live on milk, eggs and 
meat, bread and rice, for one or two months, as case may 
require. They must avoid all fried food, tea and coffee. 

To keep up the balance a patient in bed requires one- 
fifth the food of an active person in health. In all gastric 
disorders the appetite is never keen nature's warning to 
eat but little. 

Rest the stomach as much as possible. A two or three 
days' fast frequently forms a foundation on which to build 
a cure. 



46 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

A FEW GOLDEN RULES FOR THE ORDINARY 
DYSPEPTIC 

Masticate everything twice as long as you think it is 
necessary. 

Do not drink while food is in the mouth. 

Do not soften hard foods, as toast or bread crusts, by 
dipping them in water, milk, tea or coffee. 

Never drink tea and coffee at meals. A cup of milk 
flavored with coffee may be taken in the morning. Weak 
tea, with lemon and sugar, may be taken between the noon- 
day and night meals. 

Leave the table before you feel quite satisfied. 

Eat food at moderate temperatures, never too hot 
nor iced. 

Rest, but do not sleep, thirty minutes after each meal. 



AVOID 

at all times and under all conditions, even after a so-called 
cure is effected: 

All fried foods Preserves 

Sweets Iced food at the end of the meal 

Cooked fats on meat Pickles 

Tea and coffee with sugar and Boiled cabbage 

cream with meals Boiled dinners in general 

Chocolate with meals The outside pieces of baked or 
Salads with mayonnaise dressing roasted meats 

Pork Hot breads, except crisp, well- 
Veal baked waffles 

Sausages Fruits stewed with sugar 

Highly-seasoned sauces Sea foods, except white-fleshed fish 

Meat gravies of all kinds Thick rich soups 

Pies Wines at meals 
Cake 

Where there is too little hydrochloric acid in the gas- 
tric secretions, give peptonized milk, peptonized oysters, 
skimmed milk gruels, white of egg and whey, well-cooked

milk; albumin and skimmed milk; milk toast without but- 
ter; rice flour custards; potato flour custard made with 
white of egg, no yolk; buttermilk; matzoon; koumys;

with four times the quantity of scraped mutton, broiled ; 
cocoanut milk custard ; lightly cooked eggs ; a little broiled 
young chicken; boiled rice; Cream of Wheat, with skimmed 
milk; stale white bread; fruit juices alone; almond wafers. 
A plain, simple diet must be continued for some time. 
Other easily digested foods that are neither sweet nor fatty, 
may be added gradually.

In dilatation of the stomach, the selection of the proper 
quantity of correct food is quite difficult. There may be 
an excess or a deficiency of hydrochloric acid in the gastric 
secretions ; this, of course, will be determined by the phy- 
sician, who will from his analysis formulate a diet. In 
this disease bulk must be given to excite the motor action 
of the stomach, and bulk is frequently the very thing to 
avoid on account of accompanying conditions. If there is 
dilatation and a deficiency of hydrochloric acid, exclude 
all fats and fatty foods. Give a full diet of broiled lean 
meats, boiled mutton, with baked potatoes, rice, spinach, 
cauliflower, lettuce, cress, stewed summer squash, stewed 
cucumber, fruit tapiocas, dried fruits stewed without sugar, 
farina, Cream of Wheat, milk puddings and fruit vegetable 
gelatins ; stale whole wheat or white bread, or toasted pilot 
bread, potato sticks or cocoanut fingers; any hard bread 
that requires mastication. 

On the other hand, if there is an excess of hydrochloric 
acid, cream may be added to the preceding diet in quanti- 
ties determined by the physician. 

"Dyspepsia" with Flatulency This usually comes to 
persons who drink tea and coffee, with sugar and milk, 
with their meals, and to those who eat soft foods, and to 
those who bolt most of the solid foods. To correct these 
conditions, avoid all starches, sugars, all made-over dishes, 
tea and coffee, liquids with meals; in fact, it is better to 



50 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

take meat at one meal, and vegetables at another, if vege- 
tables do not cause flatulency. Sip a half pint of hot water 
a half hour before each meal, and drink a cup of weak tea, 
with lemon and no sugar, in the middle of the afternoon. 
Take clear orange juice early in the morning in place of hot 
water. Sometimes four tablespoonfuls of black coffee, hot, 
may be sipped in the morning to advantage. This may be 
followed by two soft-boiled eggs and a bit of very stale 
bread, nothing more. If hunger comes in the middle of the 
morning take a glass of modified milk, or beef tea, mutton 
broth, or chicken broth. 

For the noonday meal, eat boiled meats, or chopped 
meats, broiled or panned, and eat with them a saucer of 
sliced oranges, or a few white grapes, and one dozen 
blanched and dried, not roasted, almonds. These fruits 
may be alternated with a tender heart of lettuce, a slice of 
tomato without vinegar or oil, or very tender celery or 
endive. For the night meal, take milk toast or milk toast 
with hard-boiled egg, any of the nut dishes, or cold-boiled 
chicken, but not any two of these together, unless it is 
chicken and lettuce. It is wise never to eat meat and milk, 
or meat and vegetables, at the same meal. A restricted 
diet of this kind must be kept up until a cure is effected. 

Atonic Dyspepsia Fruit juices are foods par excel- 
lence in this disease. The gastric secretions are weak. 
Foods must be tasty, because the appetite is slim. A baked 
potato, mashed with a little butter, and a drop of tabasco, 
is frequently relished; chopped meat cakes, seasoned with 
tabasco. It is preferable to use liquid pepper, as it does 
not contain the irritating outside hull of black pepper. 
Broiled steak, a chop, roasted beef, chicken, turkey, are 
all admissible. Meat or eggs should be given twice a day. 
No coarse vegetables are allowable, but dainty green vege- 
table salads, seasoned with French dressing oil, a drop of 
tabasco and lemon juice are to be recommended. Very 
ripe raw fruits and fruit juices, cauliflower, tender lettuce, 
summer squash, tapioca, flavored with fruit juice, and cream 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 51 

soups, are admissible. Highly-seasoned, rich food must be 
given up entirely. 

Hungry Dyspepsia There are certain dyspeptics who 
seem to be always hungry. Digestion has been overtaxed 
for so long, that but little of the food ingested is assimi- 
lated, the remaining portions pass from the body in almost 
the same condition as when eaten. It is not the stomach 
that is calling for food, but the ill-fed body. The tissues 
are starving. 

Avoid all irritating foods, as bran bread, peas, husks of 
corn, skins of fruit, black pepper, ground spices, and coarse 
vegetables, that contain cellulose. 

To bring about a cure, eating between meals must be 
stopped. When hunger comes, give a glass of water, or 
fruit juices. The stomach must have absolute rest between 
each of the three meals a day. If the patient cannot be 
taught to restrain the appetite at the regular table, weigh 
the correct quantity of food, and insist upon his eating 
alone. Purees of old beans, peas, and lentils, cream soups, 
strained cereals, baked potato, boiled rice, stewed macaroni 
and cheese, cauliflower, nut dishes, and boiled meats, are 
best to allay the hunger. Do not give more than two dishes 
at a meal. Give meat and potato at one meal, cream soup 
and bread at another, or macaroni and cheese, or meat and 
lettuce, or eggs, bacon and bread, or cereals with milk. 

MAY EAT 

Cream soups Eggs

Nervous "Dyspepsia" Nervous indigestion is a term 
used to cover all sorts of morbid conditions that arise from 
defective nutrition and physical abuses. When we speak of 
physical abuses, we have in mind the active business man 
and the editor, who are overworked and badly fed. Defect- 
ive nutrition does not always come from lack of food ; on 
the contrary, the overfed, the obese and the painfully thin, 
are all, as a rule, ill-nourished. Bolting- one's food pro- 
duces indigestion that is the forerunner of nervousness. 
The vital question is, however, how can we best correct 
these conditions? What is the royal road to cure? 

Keep your thoughts in the right place, and do not 
worry about your ailments or your business. Do not talk 
of them to either your family or your neighbors; it is 
inelegant. All forms of sickness are more or less deform- 
ities, not to be spoken of in public. 

Do not take drugs without a physician's advice; it is 
always dangerous. 

Fried foods, fruits stewed with sugar, mashed potatoes, 
soups, and things that can be swallowed quickly at the 
luncheon counter, must be given up. These foods kill the 
weak, ruin the middling and help many thousands to hos- 
pitals for the insane. 

Do not eat too many dead foods overcooked meats 
and made dishes, doughnuts, pies and puddings. Use raw 
fruits, fresh green vegetables, lightly cooked, and fresh 
green salads with French dressing. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 53 

A cure is frequently brought about by eating meat at 
one meal, and vegetables at another; fruits early in the 
morning or between meals, or if you eat a hearty breakfast, 
eat fruit for luncheon, and depend upon a nutritious dinner 
for general body-building material. 

Avoid slops fermented liquors, weak tea and coffee 
loaded with sugar and cream. Eat three good meals a day. 

Do not drink milk rapidly as though it were water; 
it is not a beverage ; it is a food. 

Do not take milk and fruits at the same meal, nor milk 
and meats. 

Avoid rich, oily fish, as shad, pike, salmon, sturgeon, 
catfish, eels and mackerel ; all Crustacea, as lobsters, crabs, 
shell fish, clams, scallops and oysters ; condiments and hot 
foods covered with melted butter. 

Clam broth and oyster bouillon may be taken with 
good results. 

Complicated sweets and heated fats induce false fer- 
mentation and produce flatulency and generate an excess 
of undesirable acids which prevent perfect digestion. 

Avoid pork, veal and overfat poultry, as ducks, turkeys 
and geese. 

Eat milk, eggs, broiled steak, chops, roasted beef, mut- 
ton, broiled chicken and dishes made from chopped meats, 
carefully broiled ; now and then a baked potato ; whole 
wheat bread, well buttered ; crisp French bread, well but- 
tered; fresh green peas, spinach, tender white celery, im- 
ported endive, Romaine, hearts of lettuce, stewed cucum- 
bers, dry boiled rice, stewed spaghetti and macaroni. A 
dozen unroasted and unsalted almonds, well masticated, at 
the close of dinner, will aid, digestion. Put a bit of butter 
(not salt) on each piece of celery as you bite it off. 

Use pure olive oil and lemon juice over dinner salads, 
and masticate every piece thoroughly. In fact, butter, 
cream, olive oil or homemade cocoanut milk and cream 
should be used in moderate quantities once a day. 



54 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

An excellent breakfast cereal is ordinary white bread, 
cut into inch cubes and dried, not toasted, served with half 
cream and half milk. 

An excellent plan is to use a half pint of cream a day ; 
use it in the morning on hard bread ; for dinner, over a light 
dessert 

ACUTE GASTRITIS 

Immediate treatment is necessary; do not neglect a 
day; incurable conditions may appear. Diet is of primary 
importance, as drugs frequently irritate the stomach and 
should never be given except under the supervision of a 
physician. Select a non-stimulating diet, one that will 
utilize the secretions formed by its presence in the stomach. 
The patient should have rest, and the motor action of the 
stomach must not be taxed in the slightest degree. A good 
balance can be maintained for several days by the use of 
milk preparations. Albuminized milk, modified milk, pep- 
tonized milk, sipped slowly held in the mouth a second or 
two before swallowing. Later, when the appetite comes, 
give cornmeal and arrowroot gruels, "ye perfect food," 
Meiggs' food, egg flip, egg cordial, almond milk and plum 
porridge. After this, if the patient is improving, add a little 
finely-minced sweetbread ; scraped mutton cake, with dry, 
un-buttered, bread; soup a la Reine and Salisbury meat 
cake. Do not, however; add solid foods too soon. 

Fruit juices may be given throughout the disease, not 
with meals, but as a feeding. If any of these foods do not 
irritate the stomach and seem to agree, continue for several 
days, changing from one to another to keep up variety. If 
sweet milk does not agree (and it will not unless sipped 
slowly) substitute modified milk, or milk and lime water, 
or whey, with the addition of milk sugar. 

This disease calls for moist, not dry foods. Well- 
cooked light cereals, as farina, Cream of Wheat and 
Wheatlet, will take the place of bread, but should be thor- 
oughly masticated. Hot water may be sipped thirty min- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 55 

utes before each feeding, and, in fact, for several months 
to come give a cup of hot water an hour before each meal. 
Subacid fruits bananas, blackberries, raspberries and 
peaches may be cooked in a little water thickened with 
arrowroot, and strained through a fine sieve and served 
warm with a little whole milk. Banana meal mush, with 
milk, is frequently borne with greater ease than other 
foods. 

If fermentations begin, stop at once all carbohydrates 
(starches and sugars), substituting meat broth, fruit juices 
and modified milk. 

Lightly broiled sweetbread, chopped fine with a silver 
knife, seasoned with a little celery salt, makes an exceed- 
ingly good meal, if the patient can be induced to eat it. A 
scraped beef cake, mixed with two tablespoonfuls of fresh- 
grated pineapple, seasoned and broiled lightly usually 
agrees very well. Mutton may be substituted for beef. 

After the patient recovers, he must live on simple, 
carefully-cooked foods for a year, and perhaps longer. 
Avoid pork, veal, fried foods, lobster, clams, crabs, shrimps, 
rich sauces and highly-seasoned soups, coarse vegetables, 
raw apples, pears, condiments, excessive salt dishes, 
anchovies, herring, caviar, strong tea, coffee, and wine 
with meals. 

CHRONIC GASTRITIS 

A curative diet for this disease is milk and milk prep- 
arations, with stale bread, free from husks or bran ; lean 
meats, free from fat, scraped and broiled; carefully-boiled 
rice ; baked potato, potato puffs ; cream soups ; globe arti- 
chokes, stewed cucumbers, summer squash ; fresh fruit 
juices; grape fruit, ripe peaches; unfermented bread; 
broiled bacon; junket; all sour milk preparations, leban, 
zoolak, clabber, matzoon and eggs. 

Do not give too great a variety at one meal. If cereals 
are taken, they must be strained or free from husk. Very 
succulent vegetables may be served with meats, but starchy 



56 



MRS. RORER S DIET FOR THE SICK 



foods must be served alone. Cream soups must not be 
followed by meats. Cream soup and bread should form 
the meal. At the close of the meal give half a glass of cool, 
not iced, water, unless soup has been eaten; then do not 
drink for two hours.

ULCER OF THE STOMACH GASTRIC 
ULCER 

It is of utmost importance, in this disease, to protect 
the stomach against all sorts of irritations. The body and 
the stomach should have absolute rest if the case is severe. 
Maintain the nutrition by rectal feeding. When mouth 
feeding is admissible, cleanse the nose, throat and mouth 
before each feeding with lemon vegetable gelatin water, but 
do not use enough to be swallowed. The stomach must be 
kept empty except at feeding time, and feedings should be 
sufficiently far apart to give the stomach rest between. 
Prevent at all times the swallowing of the pus-like dis- 
charges from the nose, if there be any. 

An exclusive milk diet is best, if it agrees. If fresh 
raw milk does not agree, try sterilizing it. The physician 
who observes the case will decide the quantity of milk to 
be given, and the time of feedings four ounces is the usual 
amount, given every two hours. If sterilized milk does not 
agree, try modified milk; or plain milk, one-third almond 
milk; this frequently is more acceptable than any other 
food. If the stomach is still intolerant, return to rectal 
feeding. Frequently arrowroot milk, German flour gruel, 
gelose milk gruel, albuminized milk, almond milk, milk, 
peptonized by the cold process, and peptonized milk gruels 
served cold, agree and are retained without discomfort. 

If these foods are well borne, add now and then the 
beaten white of an egg to four ounces of milk ; and, if the 
physician believes in meat (I do not) add a teaspoonful 
of somatose or beef meal to a cup of fresh beef tea, or 
mutton broth or milk. The nourishment is reduced as soon 
as you begin to give meat preparations; if they are con- 
tinued for any length of time, without alternate feedings of 
milk, you cannot protect the body against loss of weight 
and strength. Liquid diet must be continued until all signs 
of discomfort are absent a month or a year. Do not begin 
solid foods too soon ; serious conditions are sure to reap- 
pear. 



58 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

If no complications arise at the end of one or two 
months, add a little well-cooked Cream of Wheat or farina, 
served with cream, no sugar. Now and then well-cooked 
farina served with butter; milk soups; egg and milk; 
junkets, with and without eggs; gelose milk jelly, and 
Irish moss jelly with milk. Continue this diet, alternating 
with the first to give variety, for three or four months. 
Then add slowly, watching the patient most carefully, milk 
toast, egg soup, carefully-broiled sweetbread, soup a la 
Reine, a little finely-minced white meat of chicken, a mut- 
ton cake, baked potato, boiled rice ; a little carefully-cooked 
cucumber or summer squash, with butter and a little salt; 
two or three prunes, without skins. Fruit juices may be 
taken alone at almost any time during the day if they seem 
to agree, strained orange juice, grape juice and apple juice 
preferable. 

Avoid, for a long time, all fried foods, sweets, severe 
acids, coarse vegetables, hot breads, pastry, uncooked vege- 
tables, acid fruit juices, uncooked fruits, coarse, cereals, 
condiments, highly-seasoned soup, rich dishes, fruit jellies,

INTESTINAL INDIGESTION 

Intestinal indigestion comes, as a rule, from continued 
overeating of starchy foods and sweets. It is found among 
people who eat large quantities of bread, and drink at the 
same time two or three cups of tea or coffee, with sugar 
and milk, or to those who eat large quantities of illy- 
cooked cereals, pastries, pies, cakes and puddings. This 
form of indigestion is most common, and may be cured 
permanently by living for three or four months on chopped 
beef or milk, cream soups, eggs and stale bread. In this 
disease, the secretions of the intestines become dull, 
deficient, abnormal fermentation is set up, gases are formed, 
the abdomen becomes distended, and, unless taken in time, 
the patient goes from bad to worse until he is really ill. 
Nervous and mental conditions have their origin frequently 
in intestinal indigestion. The bile is insufficient and poor 
in quality, and constipation follows. The skin becomes dry, 
dark, and loses its activity, and this overtaxes the kidneys. 
The care of the skin is of equal importance with correct 
diet. Use water freely, inside and out. Do not drink at meals. 

Cut down at once the quantity of food taken, especially 
the sugars and starches that require intestinal digestion. 
Give this part of the economy which is affected by disease, 
rest, that it may regain its lost strength. Koumys, butter- 
milk, leban, matzoon, milk with barley water, cream soups, 
white of egg and milk, may be used for a week or two in 
severe cases ; then add a scraped beef cake, broiled ; broiled

MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



birds, broiled chops, breasts of chicken, coddled eggs, a 
piece of hard toast, well masticated; or well-baked whole 
wheat bread; and so continue until the patient is relieved 
of all unpleasant symptoms. The patient may now add 
broiled, boiled or roasted meats, an occasional baked potato, 
boiled rice, bread made without shortening, either pulled 
or toasted ; fruit juices alone, either early in the morning 
as a breakfast, or between meals; a little broiled fish; the 
heart of lettuce, with French dressing; mush bread, rice 
puddings, cup custards at meals where meat is not served; 
a little carefully-boiled macaroni with Parmesan cheese, 
and delicate green vegetables, simply cooked. 

Fats must for a long time be used sparingly and care- 
fully. A teaspoonful of pure olive oil once a day may be 
taken on lettuce or cress, or over carefully-cooked spinach. 
Use a tablespoonful of cream over the breakfast cereal, or 
it may be taken from the spoon, and masticated thoroughly. 

Bear in mind that a small quantity of food taken at 
frequent intervals will bring about a cure more quickly 
than larger meals at long intervals. Do not drink with 
meals. MAy

ACUTE INTESTINAL CATARRH 

In this disease, the intestines need rest. Give stomach 
digested foods with a minimum of light starchy gruels; 
beef juice, albumin and water, dried albumin in broth, modi- 
fied milk without milk sugar, German flour gruel, arrow- 
root gruel, -weak tea, cocoa shells and cocoa nibs, with 
very little milk; blackberry cordial. Do not give whole 
milk. As the intestines begin to recover, add to the diet 
broiled white meat of chicken, broiled fish, soft-cooked 
eggs, broiled sweetbread. Give six ground almonds once a 
day, after a meat meal.

Coarse cereals Puddings 

Fruits, except those mentioned Pies 

All acid foods, as pickles, etc. Cakes 

Highly-seasoned meat soups Rich desserts 

Coffee Sauces

CHRONIC INTESTINAL CATARRH 

A person troubled with chronjc intestinal catarrh must 
live largely on broiled meat, dry bread or zweiback, or 
water crackers. Occasionally very sweet blackberries and 
ripe peaches, but fruits must not be indulged in too freely. 
Guava, quince and orange jellies are admissible. Avoid 
cereals and all coarse vegetables. Junket and junket prep- 
arations, warm cup custards, milk toast, golden toast, make 
pleasant supper dishes, but the diet must necessarily be 
more or less monotonous for a considerable period. 



ULCER OF THE DUODENUM 

Give only stomach digested foods at first white of 
egg and water, or whey, Meiggs' food, followed by modified 
milk, if mouth feeding is allowable. As the patient pro- 
gresses, add barley water to plain milk ; German flour gruel ; 
rice water and milk; milk and vichy; albuminized milk; 
nut milk ; fruit gelose ; mutton broth cooked with barley 
and strained ; Bartholow's Food ; soup a la Reine ; cocoa 
made from the nibs ; a little weak tea. During convalescence 
follow the diet given for convalescing typhoid patients. 

Avoid all vegetable foods, breads, coffee, cereals, fruits, 
except orange and grape juice; sweets; toast; fatty foods, 
except a little cream ; cheese ; meats except chopped beef or 
mutton ; rich soups, tomato especially, and sea foods. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 63 



CHRONIC CONSTIPATION 

Many persons seem totally ignorant of what causes 
and prolongs constipation. The mind has a more powerful 
influence over this than over any other disease ; for this 
reason impress upon the patient that the given course of 
diet is curative. 

Among the numerous conditions which cause and 
prolong this disease are the overeating of starches and the 
drinking of tea and coffee with sugar and cream with meals. 

Too concentrated food, and too great a variety at a 
meal. 

Drinking too little water between meals. 

Softened bread or toast by dipping in tea or coffee. 

Overeating of sweets, stewed dried fruits with sugar. 

Eating heavy meals early in the morning, whether 
hungry or not. 

Disobeying the call of nature until a more convenient 
hour. 

All these things provoke indigestion, with its accom- 
panying nervousness, constipation and lassitude, and a dis- 
inclination to be well, and a delight in invalidism. 

Such persons could, if they would, even after long 
continued constipation, bring about better circulation, more 
natural and healthful conditions. The giddiness and faint- 
ness, important complaints in the mind of the patient, are 
always emphasized at the expense of the real trouble, which 
continues. 

Green vegetables, carefully and simply cooked, fruits, 
raw or cooked without sugar, between meals or taken as 
a meal alone, are beneficial. Stewed fruits with meals or 
at the end of a meal as a dessert, are nine out of ten times 
constipating. 



64 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

The few "Dont's" that follow may help you in selecting 
a suitable diet: 

Don't eat an early breakfast, especially in bed. 

Don't eat fruits stewed with sugar at the end of meals. 

Don't drink at the beginning of a meal. 

Don't preface your dinner with a soup. 

Don't eat rich sauces. 

Don't eat mayonnaise on vegetables; use French 
dressing. 

Don't eat when not hungry. Fresh ingested foods 
meeting remnants of a preceding meal, rapidly ferment, 
producing sour stomach, and frequently in turn palpitation 
of the heart. 

Don't eat too great variety at a meal. 

Don't drink large quantities of fluids with meals ; they 
cause discomfort and interfere with the action of the heart. 



Things To Do 

Bathe or sponge every morning; rub until the skin is 
aglow. 

Drink immediately a glass of cool, not iced, water. 
In thirty minutes drink a cup of clear coffee. 

If hungry a little later, eat fruit, or a soft-boiled egg 
and bacon. 

Drink a pint of cool, not iced, water between breakfast 
and luncheon. 

Masticate every mouthful of food thoroughly. 

Drink at the end of the meal. 

Buttermilk and brown bread make an exceedingly 
good luncheon or supper. 

Take fruits with cereals, vegetables with meat. 

At bedtime eat four or five tablespoonfuls of scraped 
turnip, or grated carrot, or apple, or two ounces of peanut 
brittle, or a half pint of freshly-popped corn. 

When ready for bed, drink a glass of cool, not iced, 
water.

APPENDICITIS 

Without entering into the causes or theories concern- 
ing appendicitis, it is frequently met with in persons who 
are troubled with habitual constipation, and persons who 
sit in unnatural positions, stooping over, as tailors, seam- 
stresses, and bookkeepers. 

The first important step toward recovery, is to correct 
the irregularities of the stomach and bowels. 

Give up one meal a day, preferably breakfast. A walk- 
ing patient, going every day to the office, may cut out the 
noonday meal, taking in its place a glass of buttermilk, 
matzoon or koumys. 

Give plenty of pure cold water between meals and a 
cup of hot water before dinner. 

If breakfasts are not eaten, give in its place a cup of 
cafe au lait without sugar, or the juice of two oranges, or 
a half glass of apple juice. 

If breakfasts are eaten, the food must be light and 
easily digested : Cream of Wheat, farina, Wheatena, wheat- 
let, shredded wheat, toasted corn flakes, or strained oatmeal 
and cream, with hard bread or whole wheat bread or Roman 
bannocks well buttered, are quite enough. 

Luncheons should be composed largely of cream soups 
or milk preparations. For dinners, give boiled mutton, 
beef, chicken or white-fleshed fish, a baked potato, or boiled 
rice, or carefully-cooked hominy, or plain macaroni, fol- 
lowed by a dainty salad of carefully-cooked string beans or 
cauliflower, or asparagus with French dressing. 

Rub the plate in which you make the French dressing 
with a clove of garlic, or cut the clove into slices and mash 
it with a fork in the oil before adding the vinegar. Garlic 
is a desirable stimulant in this disease. 

Induce the patient to stop eating while the food tastes 
good. Thorough mastication is of importance. 

Do not give desserts. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 67 

If constipation is persistent, give a glass of cold water, 
with a half teaspoonful of salt added, at bedtime, and a 
glass of cool, not iced, water, early in the morning, an hour 
before giving the coffee. 

Do not depend on large quantities of meat for the 
nitrogenous portion of the diet; substitute eggs, milk, and 
ground' nuts. Whole wheat bread well buttered, milk prep- 
arations, as koumys, matzoon, clabber and buttermilk, are 
all advantageous. 

Avoid dried fruits, fruits stewed with sugar, pork, veal, 
old peas, beans, lentils, dry toast, milk toast, rich sauces, 
meat soups, pies, puddings, cakes, preserves, candies, 
pickles, and sea foods, with the exception of white-fleshed 
fish.

CHRONIC DIARRHCEA 

During the severe symptoms of this disease the patient 
must eat predigested foods, adding, as. conditions allow, 
mutton broth, ground rice gruel, barley water, and scalded 
milk; and later, a broiled lamb chop, meat juice on toast, 
a little minced chicken, and a scraped meat cake. Tea may 
be taken in the morning, and again in the afternoon, but 
not with other food. Moderately hot and clear, it is a 
stimulant. 

In certain conditions, even in chronic intestinal 
diarrhoea, the patient will be troubled with constipation. 
This does not mean that the disease is cured ; it is simply 
another phase of the same trouble. Return to the liquid 
diet, modified milk, or add sugar of milk to ordinary milk. 
Stop solid foods for the time being, and the tea. Use no 
purgatives unless ordered by the physician.

gruel, blackberry jelly, blackberry drink, grape juice, ripe 
blackberries without the core, and very ripe peaches. Give 
vegetable gelatin flavored with brandy once a day. Two hour 
feedings are recommended in acute cases. 

As the patient begins to convalesce, milk soups, butter- 
milk, leban, koumys, may be added, followed by broiled 
chops, boiled mutton, scraped beef cake, an occasional bit 
of broiled fish, with baked potato, boiled rice, and some- 
times a little stewed macaroni. Variety must come from

DIET IN HEMORRHOIDS 

Strange as it may seem, diet has a marked influence 
over this disease. If people lived correctly, irregularities 
of this kind would never occur. Chronic constipation fol- 
lows indigestion, and hemorrhoids follow chronic consti-

OBESITY 

Obesity is the natural result of overeating and drink- 
ing, and a disinclination to regular exercise. 

The reduction of fat, while it does not necessarily in- 
volve a radical change in diet, does involve great will 
power and patience on the part of the patient. An excess 
of fat must be looked upon as an objectionable form of 
disease. It does not come without invitation. One fre- 
quently notices among members of the same family, eating 
practically at the same table, great differences in weight, 
and the excuse of the overfat is they are inclined to store 
fat, or it is an inherited tendency from some remote 
ancestor. Upon observation, however, one will find that 
the fat person eats a large quantity of fat-producing food 
sugars and starches and drinks large quantities of liquids 
with meals, while the thin person will live largely on nitro- 
genous compounds lean meat, eggs and milk. Both are 
in danger, but it is more difficult to add fat to the lean 
person than to reduce the obese. 

The quantity of food given is of far greater importance 
than a radical change. If the patient has been in the habit 
of taking a heavy breakfast cereal, egg and toast, with 
coffee drop first the cereal, continue the egg and toast, and 
coffee ; later, drop the toast, and take the coffee early in the 
morning, and a raw egg and milk later. If hunger is felt 
in the middle of the morning, give a cup of clam broth or 



74 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

bouillon, or a glass of water. A radical change frequently 
upsets digestion and produces undesirable conditions. In- 
crease slowly the exercise, both mental and physical ; this 
will absorb a portion of the fat already stored in the body, 
and you will begin at once to reduce the weight. The over- 
fat woman is more liable to disease than the overfat man, 
because she naturally takes less exercise, and to correct her 
unsightly figure she wears tight clothing, pushing the fat 
from one place to another, frequently on the diaphragm, in 
turn upon the heart, which reduces the circulation until she 
really becomes an invalid. 

Her face is purple, the end of her nose is red, her breath- 
ing heavy and short, and she is pitiful to behold. Light gym- 
nastic exercises, without apparatus, should be taken morn- 
ing and night. Strengthen the muscular tissues of the 
body by increasing the nitrogenous foods lean meats, old 
beans, peas, lentils, nut foods, milk and eggs, and decreas- 
ing the starches and sugars. Keep up the bulk by using 
green vegetables, carefully cooked, tender lettuce, cress, 
with a little lemon juice, and fruits and fruit juices. Give 
a little cool water between meals, but not with meals. 

A Word About Coffee Coffee is a laxative if it fol- 
lows a glass of cool water in the early morning; it also 
spares the tissues, and, in reducing weight, the patient 
should take a cup of good percolated coffee, at least once 
a day, if it agrees. In fact, the first meal of the day may 
consist of one cup of good, strong coffee, diluted with one 
cupful of scalded, not boiled, milk. The writer sees no 
objection to a small cup of coffee after dinner, if it does 
not upset digestion. The stimulating principles of coffee 
spare the tissues and assist the obese in reducing weight. 
Coffee, unlike alcohol, allays rather than increases the 
appetite. 

Give two meals a day, and no nibble between meals. 
For dinner, give two well-broiled chops, or two poached 
eggs, or a steak or chicken. For dessert, a half pound of 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 75 

grapes, or one ripe peach, or one baked apple, or better still, 
a dish of lettuce with a few drops of oil and lemon juice, and 
a cracker with a bit of ripe cheese. 

Suppers should be light and composed of easily- 
digested foods, as milk toast; hard-boiled yolks of eggs 
and hard bread ; chopped rare meat sandwich ; koumys ; 
matzoon ; buttermilk ; one slice of brown bread and a 
glass of buttermilk; or one glass of matzoon and two 
Uneeda biscuits ; broiled sweetbreads, eggs in various forms, 
lettuce, chicory or endive salad, apple and celery salad, sliced 
oranges, two baked bananas with two ounces of gluten bread. 

The very obese should rest after the noonday meal, 
but after supper should take a short walk. Rest by chang- 
ing the occupation. Play tennis or golf every day.

DIET FOR LEANNESS 

The writer does not believe that leanness is really a 
disease that needs to have either dietetic or medical treat- 
ment, except when accompanied by anaemia, tuberculosis, 
or diseases of this kind. The ordinary person who is per- 
fectly well, and lean, is to be congratulated; he is sure to 
have a long and comfortable life. People with nervous 
activity, who are perfectly well, are apt to be lean, and it 
is well to let this leanness alone. "A lean dog is good for 
a long chase." Oils, butter, cream, milk, cocoa, chocolate, 
cocoanut fat, bread well buttered, baked potatoes with 
butter, well-cooked cereals with cream, oatmeal and corn- 
meal are all fat-producing foods. Such sweet dishes as figs, 
dates, prunes, farinaceous foods with sugar and cream, 
and honey, are to be recommended. A person who is lean 
should avoid acids, pickles, bulky foods, as turnips, cab- 
bage, carrots, parsnips, and substitute potatoes, rice, stewed 
macaroni and cereals. They may also add to the diet now 
and then a dish of preserves, jellies, or fruits with sugar; 
and may take between the morning and noon, and the noon 
and night meals, a glass of milk and an egg, or a glass of 
plain milk, or a glass of buttermilk. All foods must be 
thoroughly masticated. 

Give an ounce of butter and a third of a half pint of 
cream at each meal. 

For the morning meal, give two soft-boiled eggs, a 
piece of dry toast, or a piece of whole wheat bread, well 
buttered. If dinner is taken at noon, it should consist of a 
small quantity of cream soup, a piece of steak or a chop, 
chicken or a roast, with whole wheat bread, well buttered, 
a baked potato, followed by a cup of whipped cream, or 
some dessert over which cream can be used. For the night 
meal, use a cereal and cream, baked and stuffed potato, 
potatoes au gratin, with a chop or omelet, or broiled chicken, 
or sweetbread, with three or four stewed figs or prunes, 
with cream, or a cup custard and sponge cake. 



78 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Remember, to increase weight one must keep the 
digestive tract in a perfectly healthy condition. If cream 
disagrees, stop it at once, and give milk and egg. Give a 
glass of water at the close of each meal, not with the meal. 
If digestion is slow, give six blanched, not roasted, almonds 
after each meal. Two or three times a week, slice two 
Brazilian nuts over a lettuce salad, and dress the salad with 
two tablespoonfuls of olive oil and 'a teaspoonful of vinegar 
or lemon juice. 

Theoretically all these foods increase fat, but they 
fail utterly, from a practical standpoint, if they upset diges- 
tion. Give three good meals a day, and egg and milk 
between meals.

GOUT 

Gout, like rheumatism, may be cured on a "shilling a 
day," if you earn it. The overfed and underworked the 
idle are frequently gouty. 

Give plenty of pure water between meals; fruit juices, 
especially orange, apple and grape juice ; the yolk of an 
egg in milk ; the hard-boiled yolks grated over milk toast ; 
puree of nuts ; puree of lentils ; sweet fresh peas and corn ; 
an occasional bit of broiled white-fleshed fish, with an 
abundance of succulent green vegetables lightly cooked. 
In fact, such tender uncooked vegetables as lettuce, cress, 
celery, endive, with citrous fruits, should form the bulk of the 
diet. Give at least two quarts of water a day between 
meals, and insist upon the patient giving up all red meats, 
pink-fleshed fish, the Crustacea, lobsters, crabs, oysters and 
clams, subacid fruits, sweets and highly seasoned soups 
and sauces. Puree of lentil and puree of nuts must take 
the place of meat. Do not reduce the gouty obese patient too 
rapidly. The general vitality must be kept up. For this reason 
avoid the bulky foods, such as coarse underground vege- 
tables, potatoes, and white bread. Give skimmed milk in 
place of whole milk. Buttermilk, matzoon and zoolak are 
to be preferred to sweet milk. 

When digestion is weak and the patient emaciated, 
give lean chopped mutton cake, once a day; the yolk of a 
hard-boiled egg on toast, once a day ; sweet milk with a 
little cream between breakfast and luncheon. Boiled rice, 
stewed cucumber or boiled string beans may be given with 
the mutton cake.

All sour foods and condiments ;

The above dishes may be arranged in menus so that 
each meal will be attractive and appetizing and still simple. 

Give a cup of clear coffee, without milk or sugar, or 
fruit juice, early in the morning; the heavy meal at noon- 
day, and supper at six o'clock, composed largely of cereals. 

Caution If the patient has been in the habit of taking 
wine with every meal, cut it off gradually. If tea and 
coffee disagree, give an infusion of cocoa nibs or shells, 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 81 

with a very little milk or cream. Rich chocolate and cocoa 
must be avoided. Saline waters are to be recommended 
for the obese. A man who has been accustomed to strong 
drink generally prefers a saline water, purchased at a drug 
store, to a good spring water. Humor him in these mat- 
ters. If the patient is thin and rather anaemic, do not give 
him saline waters. Give plain pure soft water. 

Watch the patient carefully, and note the results from 
every meal. It is of utmost importance that the stomach 
should be kept in good condition. 

RHEUMATISM 

One cannot decide for one's self whether one has 
rheumatism or not. Twinges of pain may come from other 
causes. Where rheumatism occurs, the care of the skin 
is of equal importance with food. The patient must be 
protected from sudden changes in the weather. A sudden 
change from dry to damp, from hot to cold, will fre- 
quently cause much trouble. On the other hand, he must 
not sit in a close, overheated room; this makes one sensi- 
tive to cold. See that the patient is warmly dressed in 
light wool, that he may live in the open air; this, with 
correct food, will aid greatly in a cure. 

There are two kinds of rheumatism, one a sort of first 
cousin to gout, which comes to the obese, the individual 
who always gratifies his appetite on rich, highly-seasoned 
foods ; the other we find in rural districts, among persons 
who live on illy-selected foods pork and potatoes, fol- 
lowed by pie, all washed down with weak tea or coffee, 
for dinner, and bread and butter and stewed fruit for sup- 
per; or those who take milk with their meals as a "bev- 
erage." 

Persons in the first class should be made to live on a 
"shilling a day," and earn it. Wines must be exchanged for 
large drafts of pure cold water. Rich nitrogenous foods, 
sauces, soups, entrees and sweets, must be given up entirely.

82 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Eggs and milk may now and then be given in the place 
of meat. Boiled rice and carefully-stewed macaroni, with 
such cereals as Cream of Wheat, farina and hominy grits, 
must take the place of potatoes. Milk soups must take the 
place of meat soups. Green vegetables in goodly quantities 
should be added to the diet. A dish of lettuce salad, with a 
little oil and lemon juice, well-cooked spinach, cucumbers, 
tender celery, carefully-boiled dandelions, cooked cress, Ro- 
maine, string beans, young green peas, okra, Jerusalem and 
globe artichokes, are all admissible. An occasional piece of 
broiled white fish, or a few broiled oysters, or a little 
stewed veal, are allowable in cases that are not severe. 
Bread must be stale and dry. Tea and coffee with sugar 
and milk must not be given. 

A cup of black coffee is admissible after the morning 
bath and before the breakfast. 

Fruits may be eaten between meals, but not with other 
foods. 

Starchy foods should consist of carefully-boiled rice, 
macaroni, carefully-boiled chestnuts, with now and then a 
sweet potato; tapioca flavored with fruit juices, and sago. 
Cream soups are always allowable, but must not be taken 
with other foods; with whole wheat bread or hard white 
bread they form an easily-digested night meal. Milk toast 
may be given for breakfast, or supper. 

Class two must be fed wheat germ cereals, shredded 
wheat or oatmeal with cream, egg and milk for breakfast. 
Lean beef, mutton, chicken, puree of lentils, Roman bread, 
corn bread, wheat bread, well buttered, cup custards, suet 
puddings, occasionally, for dinner. Junket, milk foods, 
leban, buttermilk, brown bread, milk toast, eggs and chops 
for supper. Rice and cream are also good. 

If the patient is in bed, give a tepid bath and rub about 
eight o'clock in the morning; then a half pint of cool, not 
iced, water to drink, then a rest for thirty minutes, fol- 
lowed by a breakfast of one toasted shredded wheat biscuit, 
or a saucer of Wheatlet with a half pint of pasteurized milk. 



MRS. RORER S DIET FOR THE SICK 



83 



At twelve o'clock give a dinner, consisting of whole wheat 
bread and butter, broiled meat, with a dish of stewed prunes, 
or three or four ripe peaches, or a half pound of dark grapes. 

In the middle of the afternoon give a half pint or more 
of soft, cool water, not iced. There is no objection to a 
glass of milk in the middle of the afternoon if the patient 
seems hungry, but water, after all, is the keynote to 
recovery. At five o'clock give a puree of lentils, or any of 
the cream soups, leaving out all high seasoning. Vary the 
foods, but keep up this routine until the patient is better. 
A glass of milk may be given at bedtime, if necessary. 

Even after cured, the patient must continue a simple 
diet for many months.

CHRONIC RHEUMATISM 

The treatment of chronic rheumatism differs from 
that of the acute disease. 

Most persons with this disease are underfed and badly 
nourished ; they have been starved in the land of plenty ; 
they have been ignorant of the foods necessary for perfect 
nutrition. It is not an unusual thing to find chronic rheu- 
matism among the tea and toast maidens, or the so-called 
vegetarians of the rural districts, who live on bread, fruit, 
cereals, "weak" tea or coffee, or cambric tea, or pork and 
potatoes all carbonaceous foods. They usually have heavy 
dinners in the middle of the day, go to work quickly after 
eating, and their suppers are "light," composed of dough- 
nuts, stewed fruits, white bread, all well washed down with 
two or three cups of tea. Persons of this type are naturally 
"subject to colds." They wear three or four times as much 
clothing as is necessary for warmth, and heavy flannels 
which prevent normal activity of the skin in fact, the 
skin is almost in a dead condition. If they remove their 
underclothes at night and shake them out, a fine white 
powder falls over the floor. They sit in a warm, unventi- 
lated room, and sleep in a room with the "night air" shut 
out. These people look on pure air and water as their 
greatest enemies. 

Feed these patients rather than starve them. Give 
them eggs and milk, and red meats. Lean beef is frequently 
found advantageous. Cream soups are advisable ; yolk 
of egg and milk; infant foods, as Eskay's, malted milk 
and Mellin's food; junket; now and then a glass of 
koumys. Tea and coffee can be taken between meals 
alone, but never with food. All foods must be thoroughly 
masticated. The use of sour milk and buttermilk must be 
determined by the physician ; in certain cases they are 
good, in others bad. Give cottage cheese three or four times 
a week in the place of meat; stale bread and rice are the 
acceptable starch foods. Give citrus fruits and apples. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 85 

LIVER TROUBLES 

Just what is meant by liver troubles must be decided 
by the physician. Overeating of rich or badly-cooked food, 
and overdrinking, will frequently overtax both the digestive 
tract and the liver. Persons who indulge excessively in 
sweets, preserves and cream are apt to have what they call 
"torpid liver." The portal system of the liver has been 
overtaxed. Give it rest before it is too late. 

Biliousness is another term inaccurately used to 
express a functional disorder of the liver where there is an 
excessive secretion of bile. An excess of food, both in 
quantity and quality, may now and then be disposed of in 
a "bilious attack" ; if, however, this warning is disregarded, 
more serious troubles may result. 

Of all the organs of the body, the liver responds most 
quickly to a correct diet. Cut off at once fried foods, 
sweets, entrees, sauces, liquors, pork, veal, sea food, tea, 
coffee, chocolate, for at least a year, and note the change. 
Give plenty of water between meals. Substitute whole 
wheat bread for white. Boiled chestnuts and rice may take 
the place of potato. Fruits will take the place of desserts. 
Fruit juices should be taken once or twice a day. Give 
green vegetables every day, asparagus, spinach, summer 
squash, cucuntbers, lettuce, cress, endive with French 
dressing made from a little oil and lemon juice. Hard bread 
is to be recommended, because it requires mastication, 
which aids digestion, and good digestion aids in the activity 
of the liver. Do not give water with meals but plenty be- 
tween meals. If foods disagree, drop them at once. If 
flatulency occurs, too much starch or fat has been given. 
Give the heaviest meal in the middle of the day ; a light sup- 
per, composed of eggs, milk toast, cereals, or cocoa with 
toast. Buttermilk and leban are to be recommended.

Fatty Liver Salisbury restricted his patients, who had 
fatty liver, to a diet of from one to three pounds of chopped 
lean beef per day, with an orange or a half pound of white 
grapes. The meat must be put twice through a meat 
grinder, slightly salted, made into small cakes and broiled; 
a few drops of lemon juice may be added at the last minute. 

If the patient is tubercular, serve with the meat cakes 
a green salad, or carefully-boiled rice with a little melted 
butter. Between meals each day give a pint of milk and two 
eggs, and the juice of two oranges early in the morning. 

Starch Liver In this disease the diet is practically the 
same as for Fatty Liver, 



CATARRHAL JAUNDICE 

In this disease a fast is frequently the first aid to recov- 
ery. When feeding is allowable, begin with a small quan- 
tity of light food : whey, clam broth, albuminized water, 
albuminized whey, buttermilk, leban, matzoon, zoolak, 
lemonades, and fruit juices with effervescing waters. 

If these foods agree and the fever subsides, add a little 
nut milk, Cream of Wheat and skimmed milk, milk toast 
made from skimmed milk, mutton broth, beef broth, 
chicken broth; later, beef panada, soup a la Reine, beef 
pats, broiled ; a broiled chop ; zweiback or hard toast ; raw 
fruits alone, not with meals. If the patient has been a 
coffee drinker, give a small cup of clear coffee the first 
thing in the morning. Lemonade with effervescing waters 
may be used freely. Avoid all sweets, fats, eggs, fried 
foods, indigestible meats, as pork and veal, sea foods, 



88 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

coarse vegetables, pickles, strong tea and coffee, chocolate, 
cocoa, hot and soft breads. 

CIRRHOSIS 

This disease, which usually accompanies alcoholism, 
must have very careful feeding. Usually a milk diet, inter- 
changed with whey and milk preparations, is used for sev- 
eral weeks or months. Bartholow recommended the "grape 
cure" and the "whey cure," but the selection of food for 
this disease is best left to a physician, as each individual 
case requires individual feeding. 

GALL STONES 

This, like a hundred and one other diseases, comes 
from faulty digestion. Gall stones are found more fre- 
quently in persons who have passed middle life, whose 
digestion and assimilation for fats, sweets and starches are 
gradually lowering, and among women who wear tight 
clothing, or those who sit in cramped positions, as tailors, 
dressmakers and sewing machine operators. In these cases 
give a well-cooked cereal, Cream of Wheat, gluten mush, 
farina, banana flour mush and taro mush with cream. 
Broiled white meat of chicken or white-fleshed fish, with 
lettuce, cress, endive, spinach, cauliflower, asparagus, 
oranges, grape fruit, and lemonade with very little sugar, 
must form the bulk of the diet. A baked potato may be 
eaten once a day. Yolk of egg with milk, with hard 
bread, may be eaten now and then between meals. Weak 
tea may be given in the afternoon and plenty of soft water 
between meals. A tumblerful of hot water the first thing in 
the morning and last at night, will be advantageous.

SICK HEADACHE 

Sick headache, like biliousness, is foremost among the 
diseases that come from an over-rich, incorrect or badly-

strangely enough, the writer has seen a grandmother

idea that they must have it, because she and her mother 
had it. Progression would cease if such thoughts were 
common. Let us inherit the good, and strive to correct the

DISEASES OF URINARY SYSTEM 

It is a well-known fact that a large quantity of foods 
rich in protein throws undue work on the kidneys, and the 
poisons retained greatly influence the composition of the 
urine. Kidney troubles usually come to men who have 
passed forty-five or fifty, those individuals who eat meat 
three times a day "to keep up their strength." Diseases 
caused by incorrect diet are greatly modified by correct 
diet. In most of these troubles a skimmed milk diet is to 
be recommended. Large quantities of water are advan- 
tageous. If the patient will not take plain water, buy a 
good spring water and use it plentifully. I have observed 
that the sick feel that a bottled water purchased at a drug 
store has a greater curative power than a good cool, ,soft 
water drawn from their own spigot or spring. 

In many of these diseases, after a cure has been 
effected, a simple vegetable diet will enable the person to 
live comfortably for many years. All meats must be per- 
manently given up. Sugars and starches must be limited. 



92 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Alcoholic and malt liquors are injurious. The diet must 
be composed largely of fruits, green vegetables, milk and 
milk preparations. Oranges, grape fruit and lemonade 
without sugar are frequently beneficial. Strange as it may 
seem, the fruits that contain organic acids frequently by 
virtue of their salts, promote alkalinity of the blood and 
urine. Such green vegetables as spinach, cauliflower, 
Brussels sprouts, savoy, onions, string beans, lettuce, en- 
dive, celery, young turnips, and very young carrots, are 
admissible. 

There is a great variety of opinions regarding 
asparagus. Some physicians order it frequently for urinary 
troubles, others condemn it. One writer claims that the 
peculiar odor that is noticed after even a small quantity 
of asparagus is eaten, is due to an oil rich in sulphur, which 
is in some way digested or converted in the intestines, 
and has nothing whatever to do with the kidney action. 

The most common of these diseases will be treated 
under their special headings. 

URIC ACID DIATHESIS 

The causes of this disease are, as a rule, excessive 
eating of rich foods and lack of exercise. The blood con- 
tains an excess of uric acid or its salts. 

It frequently follows digestive troubles of long stand- 
ing. Uric acid should be converted into urea, if all the 
functions do their work properly ; but if there is any lack 
of oxidation in the tissues, the process is frequently upset 
or entirely checked, and sediment appears in the urine. 
When this occurs, animal foods and sugar must be reduced 
in amount, or better still, entirely given up. Substitute 
nitrogenous vegetables, such as soy beans and lentils, and 
milk, for meats. The morning bath and rub, and exercise 
in the open air, are of importance ; in fact, the patient would 
recover in much less time if he would live and sleep out of 
doors.

In Children This disease is frequently seen in chil- 
dren of rheumatic or gouty parents. As each case is a law 
in itself, the food must be regulated by the attending 
physician. A general outline, however, may be given for 
the benefit of the caretaker. 



94 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Fothergill, in speaking of uric acid diathesis in chil- 
dren, says "lean meats and beef tea are equivalent to so 
much poison." 

A child under five years of age must be kept strictly 
on skimmed milk and milk preparations. Milk gruels made 
from farina, cornmeal and banana flour are to be recom- 
mended. The hard-boiled yolk of egg may be grated over 
milk toast and given once or twice a week. Baked apples 
without sugar, dry whole wheat bread without butter, an 
occasional bit of white meat of chicken, cooked spinach, 
cauliflower, summer squash and cucumbers, are admissible. 
Avoid for some time to come all fats, cream, butter, olive 
oil ; such foods as rice, potato, sago, tapioca, sweet dishes, 
sugar, red meats and the internal organs of animals used 
as food. Nut dishes, milk, puree of lentils, with an occa- 
sional egg, must take the place of meat. As the case pro- 
ceeds toward a cure, add to this diet weak cocoa, dry toast, 
zwieback, tender celery, hominy grits, plain stewed mac- 
aroni, watermelons, prunes, cooked without sugar ; oranges, 
apples, raw and baked without sugar, and baked bananas. 
There must be no nibbling between meals. All foods must 
be lightly cooked. The method of cooking is quite as im- 
portant as the food prescribed. Children even at the age 
of twelve to fourteen should not be given pink-fleshed fish, 
veal, pork, salt foods, dried meats, fried foods, hot breads, 
candies, pastry, cake, dense hard vegetables, condiments 
or pickles. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 95 

ALBUMINURIA 

This disease, like most urinary troubles, comes to big 
meat eaters, people who "live to eat," and must have big 
juicy steaks every day in the week. The system is able 
to store surplus starch and sugar, the carbohydrates, but 
frequently fails in many of its functions when the proteids 
(tissue-building foods) are taken in greater quantity than 
the system requires. We can, if we cut off the carbo- 
hydrates, burn the proteids to produce heat and energy, 
but it is an extravagant and illogical way of living. In 
albuminuria there is a tremendous waste of tissue, which 
must be counterbalanced with some nitrogenous foods, but 
care must be taken to keep the balance equal. 

Of the leguminous seeds, lentils are preferable, as they 
supply nitrogen in an acceptable form. Skimmed milk, 
and modified milk without cream, may also be used for 
supplying the necessary albumin. If constipation occurs, 
substitute cream soups, and nut milks, and give orange 
juice in the early morning before breakfast. Avoid sweets 
and starchy foods as potatoes, white bread and cornstarch. 
Give pure soft water in goodly quantities. 

MAY EAT 

Water gruels, especially cornmeal Cereals with milk

FUNCTIONAL ALBUMINURIA IN 
CHILDREN 

This disease frequently comes to children who have 
had meat feeding too early, and sweets and starchy foods 
have been allowed in too large quantities. Milk and milk 
preparations should be the sole diet until the urine is free 
from albumin. Then give a grated hard-boiled yolk of an 
egg over a dish of milk toast ; milk soups, nut soups, fruit 
juices, cereals, boiled rice, rice pudding, stewed macaroni, 
puree of lentils, soy bean preparations, carefully-cooked 
spinach, cauliflower, celery, lettuce with French dressing, 
apples raw and baked, fruit gelose, sour milk foods, as 
zoolak, matzoon and buttermilk; small fruits, very ripe; 
stale bread, whole wheat and nut bread, and an occasional 
baked potato. 

Avoid all meats and meat soups, sea food, white of 
egg, raw eggs, fried foods, rich sweet dishes, pastry, cakes, 
preserves and candies. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 97 



CHRONIC BRIGHT'S DISEASE 

No matter what the origin of the disease, dietetic 
treatment is the same. Osier says, "care in food and drink 
is the most important element in the early treatment of 
these cases." All highly-seasoned foods, meat broths and 
meat and eggs must be wholly excluded. Whether or not 
the patient needs albumin must be determined by the 
physician or nurse in attendance. An uninstructed care- 
taker, cannot feed a case of Bright's disease, without 
danger to the patient; for the volume of albumin in the 
urine is not an infallible guide to dietetic treatment. 

In many cases the patient may be kept, to his advan- 
tage, for two or three months on an exclusive diet of 
skimmed milk. The quantity will vary, according to the 
age and condition of the patient, but as a rule three quarts 
of milk a day will be sufficient, or two quarts of milk and 
one quart of barley water; rice water and German flour 
gruel may be alternated with barley water. 

If barley water is added to the milk, there will be but 
little danger of constipation. If it should occur, however, 
orange juice or a small cup of French coffee early in the 
morning, will correct it. This diet may seem severe at first, 
but if the patient is made to understand that life depends 
on the diet, he will submit, if his life is worth the living. 

Keep the throat and mouth clean and free from odor. 
After each feeding swab with Listerine and water, or vege- 
table gelatin and lemon juice or Irish moss water. 

As the patient improves, add milk soups, milk gruels, 
tapioca custards, sago custards, rice pudding, various nut 
dishes, carefully-cooked topground vegetables, excepting 
cabbage; boiled or broiled fish; a little boiled or broiled 
chicken, stewed chestnuts, with sauce thickened with yolk 
of eggs, and milk toast. Give pure soft water between 
meals.

NEPHRITIS 

ACUTE NEPHRITIS 

Diet is of equal importance with medical treatment. Foods 
must be easily digested, and the diet must be restricted until 
the activity of the kidneys becomes normal- 

If the case is incurable, the diet may be more variable; 
milk soups, light meats, freshly-killed game, broiled white- 
fleshed fish, are all admissible. These, however, must be given 
under the direction and observation of a physician. Patients 
should avoid coarse vegetables, even raw celery and such green 
vegetables as asparagus, string beans, Brussels sprouts and 
mushrooms. Cauliflower, young peas, tender corn, pressed 
from the hulls, are allowed. The patient should be kept in 
bed, on an exclusive milk diet for three weeks, followed by a 
non-stimulating diet for many months to come. 

Three quarts of skimmed milk alone, or modified, 
without cream, adding an extra half quantity of milk sugar 
or mixed with barley or rice water, or cornmeal gruel, 
strained, may be given every two and a half hours. 

If there is inclination to diarrhoea, give browned rice 
gruel or Evans's tea gruel, twice a day. If there is constipa- 
tion, give buttermilk, koumys or leban. Do not give more 
than four ounces at a time, in feedings two and a half 
hours apart, unless otherwise ordered by a physician. Nut 
milk, especially almond milk, made from Sanitas almond 
meal, may be substituted now and then for plain milk. 
Give Imperial drink, lemonade and tamarind whey between 
meals once a day. Avoid all salted and sweet foods. 

When solid foods are indicated, give a chicken tim- 
bale, milk toast, farina pudding, blancmange, a few green 
peas, boiled and pressed through a sieve, stewed tender 
celery, rice and whole wheat bread. Ripe dark grapes may 
be given at noonday. A half dozen blanched, unroasted 
almonds may be added to the timbales or eaten alone, if 
well masticated. Baked apples, a little strained orange juice, 
apple juice and grape juice, are all beneficial. 



100 . MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

When the patient has quite recovered, a broiled chop, 
a little broiled white-fleshed fish, may be added to the 
preceding list. Oatmeal gruel is frequently very beneficial, 
and may be used as a breakfast food.

OXALURIA 

In this disease oxalate-of-lime crystals are found in the 
urine. By some it is supposed they are created from eating 
certain kinds of food rich in the constituents they contain; by 
others, from faulty digestion. No matter which theory be cor- 
rect, the curative diet is practically the same. Such vegetables 
and fruits as rhubarb, sorrel, onions, garlic, chives and leeks, 
old turnips, both white and yellow, tomatoes, pears and sweets, 
especially candy, and sugar in tea and coffee, and such foods as 
sago, tapioca, cassava and potatoes are prohibited. The 
diet should consist largely of milk and milk foods; for 
meat-eating patients, chopped beef and mutton are prefer- 
able. Serve with them a little stale bread, or an occasional 
bunch of grapes or tender celery. A half pint of hot water 
should be sipped a half hour before each meal. If consti- 
pation occurs, give a glass of cold water early in the morn- 
ing, and follow almost immediately by a cup of cafe au lait, 
merely warm, so the patient may drink it rapidly. Give a 
large cup of hot water the last thing at night.

CALCULI 

Induce the patient to drink abundantly of pure, soft 
water. Any good, soft spring water will answer. Distilled 
water, which is usually procurable in small towns and 
cities, is excellent. The name on the bottle makes no dif- 
ference whatever, so the water is pure and soft. In the 
early stages an exclusive milk diet is to be recommended. 



MAY EAT 

In the early stages an exclusive skimmed milk diet. 

If all goes well, ten days later, light cereal, as farina, 
Cream of Wheat, with milk, hominy grits, cornmeal mush 
with milk but no sugar, dry white bread, an occasional 
gluten biscuit, apples baked without sugar, nut purees, 
nut dishes in general, almond milk, blancmange, and eggs 
occasionally. 

In three weeks, add to the above a little white meat of 
chicken, light green vegetable salads with very little olive 
oil and considerable lemon juice ; orange juice, grape fruit,

DIABETES 

Pathologists differ as to the cause and origin of 
diabetes ; some believe the disease may be definitely located 
in the nervous centers of the brain ; others, equally skilled, 
advance the idea of defective pancreatic digestion. We 
all know that the disease produces a peculiar nervous con- 
dition, and that the pancreas is, after death, found altered 
in size and structure. No matter which of these theories 
is correct, all are agreed that a proper diet is the most 
important, and the only treatment which will bring about 
a cure. 

In this disease the lobular or glycogenic portion of the 
liver is incapable of performing its natural functions ; more 
sugar is secreted than it is capable of holding, consequently 
the kidneys are taxed to eliminate sugar from the blood, a 
work for which they are not constructed, and as a result 



104 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

the secretions are not normal ; they are more copious than 
usual, and are found to contain sugar. This leads us to 
believe that the system is overloaded with sugar, and that 
all food containing sugar, and starches, which are converted 
into sugar by digestion, must be eliminated from the diet. 
This being done, the patient will however for a time excrete 
sugar. Bartholow recommended an exclusive skimmed 
milk diet, while Salisbury told of his wonderful cures on 
an exclusive chopped meat diet. 

Green vegetables should take the place of starchy 
vegetables. Olive oil, cream and butter are acceptable, but 
all cooked fats must be avoided. Dense vegetables, as 
turnips, radishes, raw cucumbers, boiled cabbage, pickles, 
and spiced foods interfere with the digestion of other foods 
and must be avoided. If digestion is weak, give artificially- 
digested milk. Do not continue this longer than six or ten 
days, or a cure will be retarded. Begin feeding two quarts 
of milk a day, continuing this for two days, then add a 
pint for the next two days, and a pint each day after until 
four quarts a day can be easily taken. 

One fact is worth noting: a potato contains less starch 
than the same weight of bread, but is so easily digested and 
transformed that it produces in the end a greater amount 
of sugar in the urine. For this reason potatoes are for- 
bidden even for convalescing patients. Alcoholic and malt 
liquors must be avoided. Vichy water may be used now 
and then to allay thirst.

PREGNANCY 

If all is well during pregnancy, the food need not 
necessarily be changed (providing the patient is a normally 
healthy woman) until the fourth month before delivery. If 
complications arise, special diets must be given, which will 
be directed by the physician in charge. If albumin is pres- 
ent in the urine, cut off red meats and sweets. If vomiting 
occurs and is annoying, give orange juice, sterilized milk 
and lime water early in the morning and without other 
food. If the patient becomes pale and ansemic, give a diet 
rich in eggs, milk, cream and butter, red meats and fruits. 
If the appetite is physically perverted and there comes a 
mental desire for all sorts of indigestible foods, especially 
those that are inaccessible, it is purely the outcome of a 
hysterical mind and should not be humored. Much harm 
can be done, both to the mother and child, if such appetites 
are gratified. The desire for pickles or vinegar can usually 
be overcome by giving orange juice an hour before break- 
fast. 

Breakfast should be light and composed of fruits, eggs 
and well-buttered bread. Give plenty of water between 
meals. The heavy meal is best at noon, and it should 
consist of such foods as milk soups, broiled, boiled or 
baked beef, mutton, chicken or fish, with a baked potato 
mashed with cream, or boiled rice with a little butter, or 
stewed macaroni with a little Parmesan cheese, and such 
green vegetables as lettuce, cress, carefully-stewed carrots, 
turnips, celery, fresh green peas, okra, new sweet corn, and 
fruits. 

Suppers should consist of such light dishes as milk 
toast, cream soup, baked apple and cream, with toast, or 
a well-cooked cereal and milk or chocolate, or cocoa and 
toast. 

If constipation occurs give three steamed figs before 
retiring, or two ounces of peanut brittle, or an ounce of

raw peanuts, which must be thoroughly masticated, and 
a glass of water the last thing at night and the first thing 
in the morning. 

The fourth month before delivery the diet should be 
composed largely of carefully-cooked light meats, green 
vegetables and fruits. Cut off slowly all starches and 
sugars, and take only half the amount of liquids. Green 
vegetable salads are advisable. Asparagus, cress, lettuce, 
string beans and celery, may be served with French dress- 
ing. Broiled white-fleshed fish may be used twice a week, 
boiled mutton three times a week, broiled chicken twice 
a week. Beef may be used now and then, but not often. 

Do not follow fads; they are frequently dangerous, 
both to the mother and the child.

PUERPERAL 

Do not give slops; they lack nourishment and upset 
digestion. The days of water panada and cracker gruel 
are past. Five or six hours after delivery give a cup of hot 
milk, or a cream soup, or mutton broth, strained. When 
hunger comes, and not before, and this may be in ten or 
in twenty hours, give eggnog, without liquor, milk and 
lime water, milk and vichy, egg soup, chicken broth, cream 
of celery soup, mutton and oatmeal broth, mutton and 
cornmeal broth, matzoon, koumys or leban. On the third 
day, if all is well, add a milk puree of lentils, a soft-poached 
egg, milk toast, hot cup custard, Wheatena and cream, 
Cream of Wheat and cream, toast, plain or slightly but- 
tered. On the fourth or fifth day, add to the foregoing a 
scraped meat cake, a bit of broiled chicken or bird, orange 
juice, well-baked whole wheat bread without shortening 
or sugar, soft and cup custards, chocolate, alkathrepta, 
cocoa, broma, strained oatmeal, cornmeal mush, baked 
potato and boiled rice. Do not urge the patient to overeat, 
with the idea of increasing the supply of milk. Digestion 
once upset brings bad results, and while the patient is in 
bed she requires less food. If complications arise the phy- 
sician will suggest the change in diet. 

Puree of lentils, made from lentil flour, and milk and 
chocolate preparations, are supposed to make rich milk 
in goodly quantities. Sometimes they do, and sometimes 
they do not, for the ability to nurse the infant depends 
largely on the healthful condition of the mother. 

If hunger comes between the morning and the noon- 
day meal, give the patient a glass of milk, or egg and milk. 
If constipation occurs give fruit juice early in the morning, 
and add a simply-cooked green vegetable and a salad to 
the noonday meal. Give a glass of water the last thing 
before retiring and the first thing in the morning. Use 
whole wheat bread exclusively.

A FEW GOLDEN RULES 
FOR MOTHERS OF BOTTLE-FED BABIES 

Purchase the best quality of cows' milk, in sealed 
bottles. If this is impossible, and you have to buy milk 
in bulk, pasteurize it as soon as you receive it. 

Put the milk in the refrigerator or in a cold place as 
soon as it is received. Fifteen minutes' standing in a warm 
kitchen will frequently cause it to sour. Keep it covered 
or sealed until you are ready to modify it. 

Modify enough each morning to last for twenty-four 
hours. 

Keep modified milk in bottles if possible; if not, in a 
covered jar in the refrigerator. 

Ask the physician to write down the quantity that 
the infant is to have at each feeding, and the number of 
feedings per day. Commit them to memory that you may 
make no mistake. Any deviation from this rule is detri- 
mental to the infant. 

Do not put the bottle in the baby's mouth every time 
he cries, for nine out of ten times he is not crying for food. 

A correct diet will produce a firm, healthy baby, not 
a fat one. Fat babies usually fall ill on the slightest cause. 

If the baby vomits after eating, it has either had too 
much food, or the food does not agree. Consult the physi- 
cian. Such conditions should not be overlooked. 

If the baby sleeps well and looks well, nine out of ten 
times the food agrees. If it fails to gain in weight, consult 
the physician, that he may change the food. 

If undigested food is found, in the stools, the milk does 
not agree. Add ten drops of lime water to each feeding. 
Do not continue this beyond the requirements of this at- 
tack of indigestion. The use of lime water continued is 
unnatural and unhealthful. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 115 

The Gordon Walker table is arranged for the fifty-two 
weeks. After this comes the weaning time, regulated ac- 
cording to the health and vigor of the infant and mother. 
Many infants are nursed too long; the mother's milk has 
deteriorated, and the child does not thrive after weaning. 
Some argue that when the eight incisor teeth have been 
cut with ease, and this should be about the end of the 
twelfth or fourteenth month, the child should be weaned; 
the saliva now is flowing abundantly and the digestive 
organs are by Nature fitted for a little solid food. 

Dr. Joseph E. Winters, Professor of the diseases of 
children, Cornell University Medical College, says: 

"Late weaning, or the too prolonged use of milk as 
the exclusive diet of a child artificially fed, causes ansemia. 
This is the first pathological condition which we mark as 
arising from failure to modify the diet of a child at the 
proper time. The chemistry of milk, the physiological 
chemistry of the child, and the physiology of the digestive 
organs denote that such change should be made at a fairly 
definite time. From the seventh to the tenth month, 
according to the degree of development of the child and 
the advancement of dentition, the ferments which digest 
farinaceous substances are present in sufficient quantity 
to indicate that a change of food should be made." 

"Oatmeal is rich in all the constituents which are 
essential for the growth and development of the child; 
they are rich in proteid, fat and mineral matter. Oatmeal, 
the richest in iron, is an excellent food to be added first; 
strained at first when you add it to the milk in the bottle; 
later, plain cooked, with milk, no sugar. It is seldom wise 
to begin the use of farinaceous foods with a child during 
the warm months, as they are prone to cause fermentation 
and diarrhoea if the child is teething. Milk and barley 
water will constitute the child's food during these months." 



116 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

FEEDING OF INFANTS 

If possible, every healthy mother should nurse her 
babe ; there are, however, a few excellent reasons why she 
should not. Nervous women, those who are tubercular, 
or who were born of tubercular mothers, or those who have 
any form of chronic disease or general debility, should 
not attempt to nurse a child. It not only endangers the 
life and health of the child, but it is injurious to the mother. 
Volumes of directions might be given every mother who 
wishes to nurse her infant, but each individual case is a 
law unto itself and should be regulated by the attending 
physician. 

For Artificial Feeding secure good, clean cows' milk, 
from a herd of good cows, and not from a single cow, 
unless so ordered, and modify it to resemble as nearly as 
possible, human milk. Use no farinaceous substances of 
any sort, or cane sugar. An infant is wholly unprovided 
with the necessary secretions for the digestion of starches 
or cane sugar. 

Overfeeding and dirty, diluted cows' milk, and "In- 
fants' Foods" kill thousands of babies every year; in fact, 
in crowded sections of large cities these badly-fed babies 
rajely reach the end of their first year, and it must not be 
forgotten that most of these deaths occur from preventable 
causes. 

Milk is the natural food for an infant. Human milk 
contains more fat, more sugar of milk, less mineral matter 
and more friable casein than cows' milk. Cows' milk simply 
diluted with water is not enough, for cows' milk is in- 
tended for the rapid growth of the young of the cow, the 
calf. If we simply add water to cows' milk, we have 
reduced the fat and milk sugar, two elements very neces- 
sary to the growth of the infant; we have not changed 
the casein, nor have we reduced the mineral matter. 
Children fed on diluted milk are usually underfed and 
colicky. If their constitutions are strong they thrive and 
grow for a time, but fall ill on the slightest provoca- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 117 

tion. The cutting of teeth is a task. Extreme hot or 
cold weather influences them to a marked degree. Their 
childhood is too often a drawn-out invalidism. Such chil- 
dren are frequently found among the "backward" at school. 
Their foundations are poor. 



TO MODIFY MILK 

This process is simple and can be done easily and 
efficiently in any kitchen, with the ordinary utensils found 
there, provided they are used only for this purpose. Clean- 
liness must be strictly observed. Wash and scald the 
utensils each time before using; rinse them with boiling 
water, but do not wipe them. Towels hanging in the 
kitchen or pantry are apt to hold particles of dust, and 
will contaminate the milk. Before beginning, read care- 
fully all the directions, and get out all the necessary uten- 
sils. See that the nursing bottles are perfectly clean ; they 
should have round bottoms and be kept in a basket or 
stand made for the purpose. The bottles should be scalded 
immediately after each feeding, and filled with boric acid 
or a solution of baking soda made by adding a level tea- 
spoonful to a pint of water. When ready to fill the bottles 
with milk, pour the solution out and rinse with cold-boiled 
water. The nipples used should be of good quality black 
rubber. They should be kept scrupulously clean, turned 
inside out and washed every day, scalded and kept, when 
not in use, in a solution of boric acid, in a fruit jar used for 
no other purpose. Do not use the soft nipples, or any form 
of nipples fastened to a tube or bone shield. 

Prepare enough milk at one time to last for the entire 
twenty-four hours. If the weather is warm and there is no 
ice at hand, the milk must be pasteurized. 

Purchase good, pure milk in a sealed quart bottle, 
and allow it to stand for three or four hours in a cold 
place, unless the cream has already risen to the top of 
the bottle when it is received. Remove the cap, and 



118 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

with a milk dipper that has been scalded, or a siphon, 
take off the upper half of the quart (16 oz.) ; the lower 
half will not be needed. In this quantity you have the 
necessary amount of fat and protein, but you have too 
much mineral matter and not enough sugar of milk. To 
, correct this, add two level tablespoonfuls of sugar of 
milk (4/5 oz.) and a half pint (8 oz.) of cold boiled water; 
stir the mixture, pour it into the nursing bottles, fasten 
them with plugs of ordinary non-absorbent cotton, and 
place them at once in the refrigerator, preferably on the 
floor of the refrigerator, with no other food. At feeding 
time take out one bottle and stand it in a saucepan of 
hot water sufficiently long to warm it to 98 Fahrenheit. 
Remove the cotton plug, put on the nipple, turn the bottle 
upside down to see if the milk flows readily, and it is ready 
for feeding. Do not allow the nurse or caretaker to put 
the nipple in her own mouth to see if it is warm enough ; 
many an infant has been made ill by this slovenly method. 

As the child grows older increase the proportion of 
the "top milk." At the end of the fourth month it should 
be necessary to use the "top milk" from a second quart of 
milk, or use one whole quart of milk containing four 
per cent fat, and eight ounces of the "top milk" from the 
second quart, and eight ounces of cold boiled water. If 
undigested curds appear in the stools, add one tablespoon- 
ful of lime water to the day's feeding, at the time of prep- 
aration. 

For the first two weeks, the infant may not take all 
the food at a feeding. If there is any left over throw it 
away; never think of using it the second time. If the 
infant is not satisfied after the feeding, speak at once 
to the physician ; let him examine the strength of the milk 
and order it changed according to the requirements of the 
child. Food agrees when the child is comfortable and 
happy, free from colic and sour stomach, and is not con- 
stipated. After the infant has two or three teeth, if curds 
are vomited, or milk seems to- be undigested, add barley 



MRS. RORER S DIET FOR THE SICK 



119 



water in the place of plain water. If the child is con- 
stipated, use strained oatmeal water in the place of barley 
water, or German flour gruel, lightly cooked. 

The intervals of feeding will be regulated by the physi- 
cian. Otherwise the food needed during the twenty-four 
hours should be divided into nine two-hour feedings. If the 
baby is robust, perhaps eight feedings will be sufficient. 
During the second and third months the feedings are 
increased in size, and the number of feedings decreased. 
As the child grows older and stronger, four-hour feedings 
will be correct. Very small and rather delicate infants, 
who are apt to take a small quantity of food at a time, 
must be fed at shorter intervals. A healthy child of 
five months should sleep from eight in the evening until six 
next morning. The first feeding to be dropped is always the 
last feeding at night; do this as soon as possible. 

Through the courtesy of the Gordon Walker Labora- 
tories, the writer is able to give the following table as a 
guide to the correct quantity that the infant should get at 
each feeding.

PARTIAL MILK FEEDING 

No harm and a great deal of good may come when an 
infant is nursed part of the time and the bottle used once 
or twice a day to help out. Sometimes, although a mother 
has a good quality of milk, it is insufficient for the full 
development of the child, yet even a small quantity of breast 
milk is a great help to the infant. The better way is to 
reserve the bottle for the night feeding. If it must be used 
twice a day, better give it at the period nearest noon, and 
again when the child goes to bed. 

When it is impossible to give the hand-fed baby modi- 
fied milk, use good unsweetened condensed milk or Eskay's 
food. The writer has had excellent results with the latter 
food. When traveling and in the tropics, Eskay's food is 
especially to be recommended. If cream cannot be 
obtained, use ten drops of olive oil at each feeding. 

Babies fed on artificial foods are apt to have rough 
and slightly scaly skin. Correct this by giving two table- 
spoonfuls of orange juice every morning, an hour before 
feeding or between feedings. 

Meiggs' food will be found beneficial in cases of intes- 
tinal troubles. 

German flour gruel, farina, arrowroot, cornstarch and 
cornmeal gruel, thoroughly cooked and strained, with milk 
added, may be used for infants with teeth. 

Excellent results, especially in warm countries, may 
be obtained from exclusive diet of plantain pap. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 
AFTER THE WEANING 

After the infant is weaned, during the second year of 
its life, great care must be taken in the warm months. 
The basis of the diet of a child until it reaches its fourth 
year should be well-cooked cereals, fruits, milk and eggs. 
Milk may be taken alone or mixed with cereals. Fruits 
must always be given alone, and eggs, lightly cooked, either 
poached, coddled or shirred may be served with a crust of 
bread. The bottle may be continued for a while, using barley 
water and milk, oatmeal gruel, strained, with milk, or any of 
the milk gruels. Do not add sugar. Three meals a day 
should be given, with a feeding between the morning and noon, 
and the noon and night meal. Dispense with the bottle as 
early as possible; it saves trouble. Carefully-made milk 
toast, with hard-boiled yolk of egg grated over, is attractive, 
palatable and wholesome. Cereal jellies, with milk and 
cream, make an exceedingly nice supper. The first meal 
in the morning should be milk, one-third barley water. In 
the middle of the morning give orange juice, a very mellow 
ripe peach, an apple carefully baked without sugar, or a 
cereal with milk. At the noonday meal, which should be 
the heavy meal, the child may have a bowl of mutton broth 
with rice ; or, far better, give cream of celery soup, or peas, 
or lentils, or ground nuts, with stale-bread crumbs. Another 
day give the yolk of egg and bread crumbs. Another day, 
milk toast and the yolk of egg. The next between-meal feeding 
should be milk and barley water. 

The last meal at night before going to bed should be 
milk, from six to eight ounces, slightly warmed. Induce 
the child to take this from a glass or cup, rather than the 
bottle. To give variety change the method of cooking, but 
do not get very far away from eggs, milk, cereals and fruits. 
One day for the noonday meal give a baked potato mashed 
with cream, very slightly salted, or a bowl of junket, or 
a cup custard, warm, not hot. If the child is to be brought 
up a meat eater, it may have a little very finely-chopped 
white meat of chicken, or a scraped beef or mutton cake. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 123 

At the end of the second year give a little carefully- 
cooked spinach, stewed celery, stewed cucumber, stewed 
summer squash, not mashed; well-boiled rice, rice pud- 
dings, fruit gelose, soft custard with bread crumbs, and 
the upper half of a shredded wheat biscuit with warm milk. 

At the beginning of the third year the diet may be 
slightly increased in quantity, but do not add too great 
a variety. Cream may be used on such cereals as Cream 
of Wheat and farina. Wheatena and Wheatlet should be 
served with milk. Ice cream, lightly flavored, may be 
allowed once a week. Oranges, ripe peaches, baked 
bananas, stewed prunes, carefully-scalded dates, and large 
grapes, skinned and seeded, may be added. Small fruits 
should be mashed and strained. 

When the child has reached its fourth year add delicately- 
cooked green vegetables in greater variety than heretofore. 
Very young lima beans, pressed through a sieve, tender hearts 
of lettuce with a little olive oil and a few drops of lemon 
juice, very young sweet peas. Whole wheat bread should be 
used in the place of white bread. Tea, coffee and chocolate 
should never be given, nor should jelly and jam be used on 
bread in place of butter. During the warm months use the 
lighter cereals, as farina, Cream of Wheat, barley flour 
mush, rice and rice pudding. For the winter breakfasts, 
oatmeal, rye mush, cornmeal mush and Wheatlet. 

When the child is learning to eat, devote considerable 
time to teaching it the art of mastication. In this way the 
jaws are developed, the teeth strengthened and the stom- 
ach kept in good condition. Children who live on soft 
foods and swallow them without mastication, have fre- 
quently undeveloped jaws, too small to hold the teeth, 
which are apt to come in crowded and decay almost as 
soon as they are through the gums. A child should be 
taught to keep its mouth perfectly clean. Conditions aris- 
ing from decayed teeth frequently cause serious digestive 
disturbances. 



124 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Whether you feed your children on meat or not must 
be settled by the habits of the family. If meat is given, it 
should not be used more than four times a week. Lean 
scraped beef, broiled, mutton or lamb, white meat of 
chicken and an occasional piece of white-fleshed fish, only 
should be used. Pork, veal, goose, fat fowl, the internal 
organs of animals, as sweetbreads, brains and liver, should 
be strictly avoided. Meat , substitutes are puree of old 
peas, beans, lentils, eggs, milk and nut dishes. Balance 
the meals if possible ; for instance, at one meal give a puree 
of lentils, followed by a baked potato and a carefully- 
cooked green vegetable, or an egg with whole wheat bread, 
followed by a saucer of stewed prunes, or a baked potato, 
mashed with cream, and carefully-stewed spinach, followed 
by a cup custard. A cream soup with stale bread crumbs 
may be followed by a warm cup custard. A puree of lentils 
may be followed by boiled rice, carefully-cooked fresh peas 
and a fruit tapioca or a mock charlotte. Do not give eggs 
and milk and meat at the same meal. Children enjoy 
pleasant combinations.

DIET FOR OLDER CHILDREN 

Children old enough to go to school should have 
special attention paid to their diet, as diet, education and 
health bear very close relations one to the other. In the 
kindergartens, or the schools intermediate between the 
kindergartens and the first primary division, children 
usually carry their luncheon, and as they must put it out 
on tables before the teacher, she has supervision and care 
over what they eat in fact she frequently suggests the 
luncheons; but where these matters are left to ignorant 
parents, children suffer and frequently break down before 
they have finished their school period. During these days 
the child is growing rapidly, and at the same time exer- 
cising both mind and body. These conditions call for a 
liberal and correct diet. Correct diets are not always those 
that are easily digested. We do not mean by this that 
indigestible foods should be given, but that it is not neces- 
sary always to give easily-digested foods. The stomach 
needs exercise as well as every other part of the body. 

The diet for school children should contain a goodly 
quantity of protein in order to repair and build new tissues, 
and sufficient fats and carbohydrates to yield heat and 
energy. It must not be forgotten that the bones and teeth 
must also be nourished ; they have not yet reached their 
full development. Children underfed are usually nervous, 
and frequently have to be forced to go to school, they have 
not the vigor to keep up with the class. Nine out of ten 
times this is due to underfeeding or incorrect feeding one 
is as bad as the other. 

All children are not born alike. Many come from 
scrofulous, gouty, rheumatic or tubercular parents, and 
must be fed on different food from those born of perfectly 
healthy parents. School children should be under the careful 
observation of their Domestic Science teachers. 

Children fed on bread, meat, potatoes and sweets are 
very apt to become constipated. Fruits and fresh green 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 127 

vegetables, simply cooked, with well-cooked cereals, milk 
and eggs, should form the diet of childhood. If the family 
are meat eaters, mutton, chicken and beef should be de- 
pended upon, and the meals should be divided and 
arranged according to the seasons. In the summer a 
comfortable, warm breakfast is as necessary as in the 
winter, and should be composed of light, well-cooked 
cereals and milk, with a piece of whole wheat bread, care- 
fully buttered, or a soft-boiled egg or two, with whole 
wheat bread, well buttered, and fruit. In the summer use 
the lighter cereals, as Cream of Wheat, farina, whole 
wheat, rolled wheat, rolled barley and shredded wheat. In 
the winter, oatmeal, Wheatena, Wheatlet, hominy grits, 
cornmeal mush and rye mush. 

If lunches are carried to school, they should consist of 
nut bread, well buttered, plain whole wheat bread and 
butter sandwiches, plain whole wheat bread with grated 
yolk of egg between, and fruit apples, oranges and pears, 
not bananas. Bananas should be given for breakfast, and 
should always be well cooked. 

Add to the noonday luncheon a cup custard, or jar of 
rice pudding, or a jar of good sweet milk or buttermilk. Do 
not give hard-boiled eggs, because the complete digestion of 
the whites takes too much time and the child does not get the 
full benefit; but two or three yolks that have been boiled 
a half hour may be grated and put between the bread and 
butter. 

Avoid all sweets, cakes, pies, pastry and cookies. Do 
not put lard or sugar in the bread for either children or 
adults. If it can be carried, there is nothing better than 
a half pint of milk for the noonday luncheon or a half pint 
of buttermilk ; when these are added to the luncheon do not 
use meat. Chopped white meat of chicken, chopped beef 
or mutton, carefully and lightly seasoned, may be used for 
sandwiches ; and fruit should be used freely for desserts. 

A child should not study immediately after eating, but 
should have sufficient time for digestion to begin. 



128 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Among the "backward" at school are found children 
illy nourished, those who are given incorrect food, and 
those who are allowed to remain in bed until the last minute 
and go to school after a hurried, badly-served breakfast. 
Tea, coffee and chocolate are frequently given to such 
children because they can drink them quickly, or because 
it is a cold morning. If the child is healthy he will want 
a substantial cereal, and will be able to keep warm without 
a hot drink. 

Growing children need three good, nutritious meals a 
day, and must not nibble between meals. Children "with- 
out appetites" are those who eat at cakes and candies 
between meals. Constant nibbling, like constant chewing 
of gum, destroys the appetite, increases the flow of saliva, 
which interferes with stomach digestion. 

Of equal importance with diet is careful bathing and 
plenty of fresh air and pure water. Children should sleep 
in well-ventilated rooms, should take a glass of water the 
last thing at night and the first thing in the morning, and 
should be carefully bathed and rubbed. Hours of eating 
should be regular. The digestion of a healthy child is 
active, and food passes from the stomach in much less 
time than in adults. Parents frequently forget this and 
keep the children waiting too long between meals. 

Children who are obliged to carry cold luncheons for 
the noonday meal must have a warm, comfortable supper 
not later than six o'clock. If they come home in the middle 
of the afternoon (two or three o'clock) they should have 
a glass of milk, or a cup of good, warm cream soup, or a 
glass of buttermilk, or an egg and milk. Breakfast was 
early, luncheon light at noon, they have not had sufficient 
food. In fact, herein lies the danger of broken health in 
childhood. They frequently come home hungry, and eat 
.candies, or cakes, which satisfy the appetite without giving 
sufficient nourishment. Supper should be composed of 
well-baked potato, or boiled potato mashed and browned, 
or rice, or stewed macaroni, with beef, mutton or chicken, 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 129 

or white-fleshed fish and either a saucer of whipped cream, 
or fruit tapioca, or fruit gelose, with bread and butter. Puree 
of beans, lentils and dried peas may take the place of meat. 
If children are fond of cereals, it is well to start the night meal 
with cereal instead of soup. Children do not require soup at 
the beginning of dinner. Milk, hot or cold, not iced, may be 
given with all non-meat meals. Children should be taught to 
masticate thoroughly and eat slowly, and after dinner they 
should have at least one hour of quiet recreation before be- 
ginning study. 

The food value of almost every article depends upon 
the method of cooking. Children should not be given 
fried foods, or such complicated dishes as pies and pud- 
dings. Incorrect combinations interfere with digestion. 
Do not give potatoes and rice, or white and sweet potatoes 
at the same meal ; give one or the other, and select a green 
succulent vegetable, suited to the combination. Green 
string beans are palatable, sightly and valuable as a green 
vegetable when cooked in salt water; when cooked with 
meat they are rendered indigestible. Potatoes well baked, 
or boiled, mashed and browned, are easily digested, an 
excellent food, but when fried are worse than useless. 
Rice carefully boiled until each grain is swollen to twice 
its former size, and no two grains sticking together, 
requires only one hour for perfect digestion; but when 
heavy and soggy and cooked with milk it is the worst 
form of starchy food; it will produce sour stomach and 
flatulency at once. 

Every mouthful of starchy food is, during the process 
of digestion, converted into sugar, and with such natural 
sugars as we find in fruits, a child will have quite enough 
sugar without adding sweet foods or putting sugar on 
cereals, or eating candies. In cold weather a lump of cut 
sugar may now and then be given in the place of candy, 
but such things are more or less temptations and the child 
is quite as well off without them. Mock candy, figs and 
prunes make nice desserts. Cereals should be cooked

the night before, allowed to stand in a double boiler and 
reheated in the morning. 

Bread should be made from whole wheat flour, free 
from lard and sugar and be well baked. Whole wheat 
bread does not contain more muscle-making food than white 
bread, but it does contain mineral matter, and this is ah 
important element in child nutrition. 

Teach your children to eat a green vegetable every 
day. At first select those easy of digestion boiled 
cucumbers, young carrots, spinach, young green peas, 
tender lima beans, tips of cauliflower, stewed tender celery, 
hearts of lettuce, tender endive, and, if allowable, asparagus 
tips. 

Children enjoy pleasant combinations. With broiled 
or boiled fish serve crisp lettuce and little potato balls; 
with stewed chicken, boiled rice, stewed celery or peas; 
with steak, cauliflower and baked potato; with mutton 
chops, creamed potato and peas ; with a chopped broiled 
meat cake, mashed and browned potatoes and stewed 
cucumber. Desserts must be arranged according to the 
meat portion of the dinner. Without meat, serve cup 
custards, soft custards or bread puddings made from egg 
and milk ; with meat dinners, fruit tapiocas, vegetable gela- 
tin with fruit juice, whipped cream, slightly flavored, or 
fruit carefully stewed without sugar. Water should be 
the only beverage. Milk takes the place of meat; it is a 
food containing a considerable amount of solid material. 
Chocolate is an admirable food and may be taken in the 
morning with bread and butter for breakfast, but it must 
not be given with a heavy meal. Tea and coffee have no 
place in a child's dietary. 

Fat ranks first as heat-producing material. In winter 
add cream to the milk and see that the bread is well 
buttered. Use olive oil, with a little lemon juice or vinegar, 
over uncooked green vegetables.

MARASMUS 

This disease comes, as a rule, from malnutrition ; it 
is really slow starvation. Such infants frequently have a 
sufficient amount of food, but the food is not suited to their 
natural condition ; they are starving on plenty. Many of the 
artificial "infant foods" contain starch and other materials 
absolutely unfitted to the digestion of a newly-born babe. 
The infant will grow thinner and thinner as the days go 
by, until it finally presents that wasted, worn, shriveled, 
old appearance which follows starvation. Milk of poor 
quality will bring about the same conditions. 

Do not undertake to treat a marasmus baby unless 
you have the advice of a physician. Modified milk will 
frequently bring a child back to normal condition in a few 
weeks. "Skin Feeding" s'ometimes becomes necessary: 
when the child is being prepared for bed, give it a warm 
sponge bath, dry the skin carefully and rub all over with 
cod liver oil ; do it gently but thoroughly, using at least two 
teaspoonfuls for the inunction. 

As the child grows older, if it has teeth and increases 
in weight, give barley water and top milk, using sugar of 
milk in the same proportions as in modified milk. If the 
child is very young and very ill, feed every hour a table- 
spoonful of cream and water, for two or three days, then 
give modified milk and keep up the oil inunctions. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 133 



MEASLES 

During the height of the fever give hot water, or hot 
water and milk. A fast is to be recommended. When the 
appetite appears give milk, milk and barley water prefer- 
able, hot or warm milk soups, with hard toast; the top of 
a shredded wheat biscuit with hot milk, farina and Cream 
of Wheat, which are quite enough until the fever subsides. 
Milk foods should be given about three hours apart. Thirst 
may be allayed by warm tea, clover tea, or just simply a 
pinch of green tea and a pint of water. 

When convalescence appears, cereals and milk, with 
the exception of oatmeal, should form the bulk of the diet. 
Then add cream soups, cup custards, blancmange, junket, 
coddled, poached, fluffed and snow eggs, fruit and fruit 
juices ; vegetable gelatin with fruits ; baked potatoes ; plain 
boiled rice ; potato souffle ; potato timbale ; ground almonds 
mixed with the breakfast cereal; rice dumplings; rice 
cream ; rice pudding, and such milk foods as plum porridge 
and milk jelly. 

Avoid All foods difficult of digestion, as coarse vege- 
tables, highly-seasoned soups and sauces, cakes, pies, pre- 
serves, ice creams, other cold foods and meats. The return 
to a solid diet must be made very gradually. 



CHOREA 

In this disease diet is of primary importance. When 
it occurs in children, the diet should consist exclusively 
of fruits, tender green vegetables, well-cooked cereals and 
cream, eggs and milk. Fatty matter is called for in an 
easily-digested form, as whole wheat bread, well buttered, 
a little olive oil on hearts of lettuce, or on tart apples cut 
into blocks, or over well-cooked spinach, or cream on 
boiled rice, or on a well-cooked cereal.

As soon as the swelling subsides, the patient may take 
semi-solid foods of a non-stimulating character. 



WHOOPING COUGH 

In cases of either mild or severe whooping cough the 
stomach and bowels require very close attention. Mucous 
membranes in general are affected, and incorrect food 
induces indigestion, and this increases the number and 
severity of the paroxysms. As there is always a tendency 
to vomit, a small amount of food given at regular and 
frequent intervals is best. Three meals a day will hardly 
answer in this disease. Liquids and semi-solid foods only 
should be given during the first, severe, part of the dis- 
ease. Osier says, "Give no solid foods, nor fruits, except 
orange and lemon juice, and do not give these with other 
foods." 

Those who adhere most rigidly to given rules can 
reduce the number and severity of the paroxysms very 
quickly.

ENURESIS 

A simple nutritious diet helps greatly in correcting 
this trouble. Liquid foods and large quantities of water 
should not be taken after five o'clock in the evening. 
Breakfasts should be nutritious and composed largely of 
eggs, simply cooked ; dry or milk toast, stewed prunes, figs 
or baked bananas, and a glass of milk. The heavy meal 
should be at nopn and consist of chicken, eggs, white- 
fleshed fish, baked potatoes or boiled rice ; a little spinach, 
carefully-cooked peas, sweet corn cut from the cob, care- 
fully-stewed young turnips or celery, and a simple dessert, 
fruit gelose, fruit tapioca, or a little whipped cream. 

Suppers should be much like breakfasts, bread and 
milk, cornmeal mush and milk, milk toast, stewed figs and 
cream, with toast. After the child is prepared for bed, see 
that the bladder is emptied, and that he is in a comfortable 
position, with his head almost level with the rest of the 
body. 

Such children must avoid at all times tea, coffee, spiced 
foods, red meats, sour foods, candies, cakes, rich puddings, 
pies, pork, veal, fried foods, beef tea, bouillon, consomme, 
hot breads, bran breads, coarse vegetables, and they must 
not eat between meals. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 137 



DIET IN RELATION TO AGE 

When a man has passed his fiftieth year, he certainly 
has less call for food than during the early and more 
active part of his life. His structure is complete; he needs 
only a sufficient quantity of easily-digested foods to repair 
his tissues and keep up his bodily heat and energy. If the 
y t oung overeat, they can rectify it now and then by a 
"bilious" attack, but such dissipation reduces the aged to 
a condition of invalidism. 

The character as well as the quantity of food must be 
changed to suit the age. Violation of nature's laws, false 
ideas of the amount of nourishment required, have much 
to do with early feebleness. More than one-half of the 
diseases that embitter the middle and latter portion of our 
lives, are due to errors in diet. A perfect old age, how- 
ever, has its foundations laid in youth. One cannot dissi- 
pate for a quarter of a century, and expect nature to for- 
give and forget. 

If persons have been accustomed to a mixed diet, it is 
better perhaps to keep on in moderation. More foods are 
required by the active aged than by those who are simply 
waiting. 

Meats should not be eaten more than four times a week 
and then at the noonday meal; substitute eggs, milk and 
milk preparations, puree of lentils, old peas, beans and 
peanuts. Boiled meats are more easily-digested than 
baked or fried. Breakfasts should be light, composed of 
fruits, cereals and whole wheat bread, or eggs, toast and 
cafe au lait. Soups should not precede the noonday meal, 
too much liquid reduces the strength of the gastric secre- 
tions. A puree of lentils is really the meat dish and need 
only be accompanied with a baked potato or boiled rice. 
A liquid or semi-solid food, as cornmeal mush, cocoa, milk 
toast, eggs and milk, gruels with toast, form admirable 
suppers. Buttermilk, cottage cheese, koumys, leban, are 



138 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

easily digested, and with a piece of toast contain sufficient 
nourishment for the night meal. 

Do not neglect the output, nor the relations between it 
and the intake ; the motto must be, light easily-digested 
meals, with not one ounce more than is necessary. The 
machinery of the aged is easily upset. 

As sleep bears a close relation to food, take the lightest 
meal of the day at night.

FEEDING IN FEVER 

Graves, in 1848, commenced to feed fevers. Prior to 
that time most fever patients had been starved, and we 
might add, most fever patients died, for in addition to 
starving they were bled. In all fevers the proteins are 
lost in greater proportion than the fats. The appetite is 
weak, sometijnes entirely lost, the digestive organs lack the 
natural activity, and thirst is intensified. To keep up the 
supply of protein during this rapid loss, give milk in as 
large quantities as can be readily digested by the patient. 
Add the white of egg once a day, if it is agreeable to the 
patient and the physician. 

Avoid solid foods ; they are slow of digestion, fre- 
quently decompose in- the intestines and provoke serious 
new diseases. 

The nurse must be perfectly familiar with the food 
requirements, for in fevers, diet is of first importance. Do 
not be guided by the patient's appetite. The gnawing of 
a sick stomach does not always mean hunger. 

Milk is almost universally used as diet in fevers. Two 
quarts a day, about 1300 calories, will be borne quite 
easily if modified with barley water in proportion of one- 
third to two-thirds milk. 

Do not insist upon milk and barley water at every 
feeding if the patient objects. Give at one time modified 
milk, at another, milk shaken with white of egg, orange 
juice with white of egg, or milk and Vichy, milk and lime 
water, or koumys, leban, junket, pancreatized milk, zoolak 
or kefir. If the taste of milk is objectionable, you will find 
in another portion of the book recipes for changing its 
flavor. Eggnog, egg and milk, sometimes the yolk of the 
egg beaten with the milk, at another time the white of egg 
and sherry, if admissible, plum porridge, rice water and 
Tnilk, arrowroot milk gruel, are all to be recommended. 

Personally, I object to beef tea or any form of meat 
soups in fevers. I have passed through typhoid fever 



142 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

twice, and had good recoveries both times from milk and 
milk preparations. Meat and meat preparations were 
tried, with unsatisfactory results; they lack nutrition. 
Without having any personal idiosyncrasies for meat, I 
feel that milk m'akes a far better fever food. My opinion 
comes from experience rather than prejudice. 

Gelatin preparations and gelatin drinks are often val- 
uable in cases of intestinal hemorrhage. 

Never overfeed the patient; there is a diminution in 
the power of the digestive organs and they must never be 
overtaxed. A little food and often is the motto. 



TYPHOID FEVER 

In typhoid fever there is a close relation between 
right feeding, good nursing and recovery. At no time dur- 
ing the prevalence of the fever must there be the slightest 
departure from the food ordered by the physician. As the 
intestines are involved in this disease, it seems wise to give 
stomach-digested foods, but in all fevers gastric digestion 
is weak, hence stomach-digested foods must be carefully 
selected and easy of digestion. 

Milk and milk foods are usually most acceptable. If 
the taste of milk is objectionable, change the flavor as 
directed in another part of this book. 

Do not give solid food unless you have the consent of 
the physician. A tiny bit of orange pulp, or even a portion 
of soft-boiled white of egg, may escape digestion, pass into 
the small intestines, form an irritant and in turn endanger 
life. On the other hand, it must be remembered that full 
feeding is necessary. The milk you give must be whole 
milk, containing its full amount of fatty matter, and if 
barley or rice water be added, the tissues of the body are 
spared. In some cases the stomach is particularly sensitive 
to the curd of milk; this will be known quickly by the 
appearance of tympanites, or indigestion and flatulency. 
Stop milk feeding at once, and substitute modified milk, 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 143 

peptonized milk, koumys, white of egg and water, barley 
water and cream, beef tea, beef essence, carefully-strained 
broths in which you have boiled either rice or barley. These 
foods contain the necessary elements of nutrition, presented 
in easily-digested form. 

Where mjilk cannot be borne, feeding becomes more 
complicated, and where a patient has prejudices in health 
little can be expected in sickness. If your patient is com- 
fortable and seems well nourished, is not losing fat too 
rapidly, has no distressing abdominal symptoms and no 
undigested food, in the stools, take for granted the feeding 
is correct, and continue it. On the other hand, if the patient 
is losing weight rapidly and there are abdominal complica- 
tions, take for granted the feeding is incorrect, or it may 
be insufficient in quantity ; then change the diet, or increase 
slightly the quantity. 

Many cases under my observation have been able to 
take eight ounces of milk and barley water at a feeding. 
Again, I have seen robust people who could not digest four 
ounces in three hours. One quart and a pint of milk, with 
one pint of barley water, per diem, is a fair allowance. 

If diarrhoea is prevalent, use ground rice gruel and milk 
that has been pasteurized and cooled. If vomiting occurs 
give orange juice, or other fruit juices in small quantities, 
and a little lime water, with !milk. 

Toast water, carefully strained, will sometimes allay 
thirst more quickly than plain water. Irish moss gruel or 
gelose water are exceedingly nice swabbing materials for 
the mouth ; they prevent the mouth from becoming so dry. 
A typhoid patient, whose mouth and lips become parched, 
cracked and sore, will frequently refuse nourishment when 
hungry. In fact the mouth should be rinsed or swabbed 
with some mucilaginous water each time before feeding. 
A few drops of Listerine or Glycothymoline in water is 
frequently very pleasant. After each feeding the mouth 
should be cleansed. 



144 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

CONVALESCING TYPHOID 

After the patient has had a normal temperature for ten 
or twelve days, if agreeable to the physician, add a little 
semi-solid food to the general feeding: a frothed egg, 
omelet souffle, cup custard, bonnyclabber with cream and 
nutmeg, banana gruel made from banana meal, served with 
cream, a scraped beef cake, a very tender broiled chop, a 
piece of broiled sweetbread, a piece of juicy .steak, the yolk 
of a hard-boiled egg grated over milk toast, a poached egg, 
a coddled egg, rice gruel made by boiling rice carefully and 
pressing it through a sieve, diluted with milk or cream, 
broiled bird, free from fat and lightly seasoned , carefully- 
made soups and cream soups. These dishes should at first 
be used only once a day, and that at noontime. 

Avoid all vegetable foods for at least six weeks, with 
the exception of now and then a carefully-baked potato and 
a little carefully-boiled rice. When desserts are added they 
must follow the noonday meal. Wine jelly, Irish moss 
jelly, floating island, cup custards, cocoa, a cup of racahout; 
now and then farina custard, are admissible. Avoid all 
flavoring extracts in desserts; use in their place a tea- 
spoonful of caramel or a tiny bit of the grated rind of 
orange or lemon, strained out. 

Do not allow the patient to eat too much. Remember 
that after typhoid a person is very hungry and inconsistent 
as to what they want and the amount needed. No matter 
what the patient wants, give a small quantity of easily- 
digested foods. 

If there is a rise in temperature after the first or second 
meal of solid foods, return again to liquid diet and con- 
tinue it until the temperature falls to normal. At the end 
of a month, if the temperature is normal, the bowels regu- 
lar, and there is no diarrhoea, the patient may select one 
or two favorite articles, for the noonday meal. This does 
not include such indigestible foods as lobsters, crabs or 
shrimps, or coarse vegetables, dried fruits, pies, puddings, 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 145 

or fried foods. Chopped meat cake, broiled sweetbreads, 
birds, venison, baked potato, young chicken, and light 
strained soups, are allowable. 

DENGUE FEVER 

In this fever use precisely the same diet as in typhoid, 
and if the person is robust, a fast of three or four days, with 
plenty of water, is to be recommended. 

MALARIAL FEVER 

A fast of one or two days, followed by white of egg 
and water for one day. Nut milk is excellent in the first 
stages of malaria. Fruit juices, especially orange juice, is 
always to be recommended, and may be used from the very 
first day. If orange juice is out of the question, use apple 
or grape juice. Then the white of egg in a half pint of 
water every alternate feeding, with milk and lime water 
for a week. Then add milk soups, gruels, and such milk 
preparations as koumys, leban, zoolak, matzoon and butter- 
milk. As soon as the patient can take solid food, add 
peas; spinach; dandelions, finely chopped; cauliflower; 
boiled cucumbers, with a little butter and salt; summer 
squash; a broiled chop; broiled chopped meat; chickens; 
white fish ; baked potato ; boiled rice, and macaroni. 

SCARLET FEVER 

The writer has had considerable experience in the 
feeding of scarlet fever, and has found that the best results 
come from a non-meat diet, and she fully believes that a 
strict milk and barley water diet is best until the fever sub- 
sides. During convalescence give alternate feedings of 
farinaceous gruels, arrowroot, rice flour, farina, Cream 
of Wheat. Meiggs' food, lentil milk gruel, and "ye perfect 
food." If the appetite increases and the patient seems to 
want solid food, give Cream of Wheat and farina, served 
10 



146 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

with milk. If milk becomes tiresome, give buttermilk, 
koumys, leban or matzoon, or any of the milk preparations. 
If it becomes distasteful, change its flavor according to 
directions given in the Second Part of this book. Orangeade, 
orange juice and lemonade may be used to allay thirst. In 
an ordinary case, the patient may be given the juice of 
four oranges a day. 

MAY EAT, DURING CONVALESCENCE 

Milk and milk preparations Orange juice 

Milk toast White of egg and orange juice 

Cup custard White of egg and apple juice 

Farina Fresh-made grape juice 

Cream of Wheat Lemonade 

Old-fashioned rice pudding Carbonated waters alone, or with 

Stale bread and milk milk or orange juice 

Tapioca pudding Lime squash 

Blancmange Orange water ice, unsweetened 

Junket Frozen grape juice, unsweetened 

LATER, ADD 

Poached eggs Whole wheat bread 

Soft-boiled eggs Fruits stewed without sugar 

Hard toast Soy bean or lentil soup 

The return to a meat diet must be postponed as long 
as possible, the writer believes forever, but if the patient 
belongs to a meat-eating family, meats will be added. Begin 
with the white meat of chicken, and a small quantity of 
boiled lamb or mutton. Do not add beef for some time 
to come, and avoid all sea foods. 

Avoid during the height of the disease and throughout 
convalescence : 

All meats, meat soups and meat Sour foods 

extracts Vegetables 

Highly-seasoned foods of all kinds Hot breads 

Sweets Desserts 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 147 



YELLOW FEVER 

Physicians in the tropics recommend in all cases of 
yellow fever, an absolute fast, no matter whether the 
patient is robust, or slender and frail. 

If vomiting occurs, and continues for any length of 
time, rectal feeding must be resorted to, but this is fre- 
quently quite as irritating as food administered by mouth. 
Solid foods must be forbidden until the patient is far on the 
road to convalescence. The physician alone knows when 
and how to arrange suitable convalescing diet. If the 
patient is in any civilized country, where predigested foods 
can be obtained, these should be the first to follow the fast. 
Avoid, however, all meat preparations in hot climates, no 
matter whether they are predigested or not, and sugar. 

MAY TRY 

Albuminized water Whey 

Lime water and milk Whey and white of egg 

Bicarbonate of soda and water 

PURPURA HJEMORRHAGICA 

Feed the same as in fever, but substitute four ounces 
of fresh grape juice, for three regular feedings, one in the 
morning, another at noon, and one at six o'clock. It is most 
important that the grape juice be freshly made, according 
to the recipe found in another part of this book. 

If milk and barley water have been the main diet, a 
change to almond milk, gelatin water with lemon or 
orange, limeade, orange juice and white of egg, dry albumin 
in milk, is frequently beneficial. 

It is extremely necessary that the diet be nutritious 
and liquid. 



148 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



SMALLPOX 

During the early stages of the disease there is little 
or no desire for food. Plain milk, or milk one-third barley 
water, milk with dry albumin, peptonized milk, or milk and 
carbonated waters, give quite enough variety. Do not urge 
the patient to eat until appetite appears. Then add milk 
soups, nut soups, eggs and milk, eggnog, egg flip, Cream 
of Wheat and farina. Later, when the fever subsides, add 
a baked potato, or a South American yam, milk toast, egg 
and egg dishes, and milk preparations. Lemon and 
orangeade may be used freely between feedings, to allay 
thirst. If the fever again appears, go back immediately 
to the diet recommended at first. The hours of feeding 
will be about the same as in typhoid fever. Avoid meat 
and meat dishes, and use as little salt as possible. Mutton 
broth is now and then ordered by physicians, but as it 
contains little or no nourishment, milk is to be preferred. 
Raw egg, with a few drops of lemon juice, if the patient 
can take it, is far better than meat. 

During convalescence, or as soon as the fever subsides, 
increase the diet. Add broiled sweetbreads, broiled chops 
and a little white meat of chicken, but depend for the bulk 
of the food upon well-cooked Cream of Wheat, farina, 
shredded wheat biscuit, with milk and cream, eggs, rice 
pudding, cup custards, junket, milk toast, tapioca pudding, 
and carefully-cooked fruits. Whole wheat bread should be 
used in place of white bread, and all bread given should be 
made without sugar or lard. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 149 



DISEASES OF THE SKIN 



The skin, being a delicate and sensitive secretory organ, 
is easily affected by habits, diet and exercise. 

Nettle rash is perhaps the best example of a 'cutaneous 
disorder resulting from the toxic influences of food. 

Persons who eat indigestible compounds, as pie, cake, 
preserves, fried meats, fried starchy foods, as potatoes, 
and such made dishes as croquettes, and those who wash 
down each mouthful of bread and butter with weak tea 
or coffee containing sugar and cream, are frequently 
troubled in the cold months with various eruptions of the 
skin, especially on the hands. The clammy moist hand 
of the dyspeptic is one of the first symptoms of an 
unhealthy skin. In cold weather the skin of the face is 
rather red and coarse ; in warm weather it becomes greasy. 
To correct these conditions, add to the daily diet tender 
green vegetables that can be eaten raw with a little French 
dressing. Give an abundance of ripe fruits, fruit juices, 
whole wheat bread, rye bread, and now and then brown 
bread. Orange juice, grape juice, apple juice, early in the 
morning, or between the morning and noon meal, are to be 
recommended. If the patient is thin and anaemic, follow 
diet in leanness; if robust, the diet for the obese. 

Give plenty of water between meals.

ACNE 

It is said by many dietitians that acne may be entirely 
overcome by correct and special diet. It is true that acne 
is worse among people who live largely on hot breads, fried 
food, rich starchy dishes and sweets. Avoid fat meats and 
sea foods. Use eggs, milk, and sour milk foods, green vege- 
tables spinach, lettuce, salads with olive oil and lemon

ECZEMA 

In eczema, as in all skin diseases, a correct diet plays 
the most important part in the cure. The stomach must be 
kept in good condition, the bowels regular. If the patient 
is anaemic, give white of egg shaken with milk, between 
meals, every other day ; buttermilk or koumys the alternate 
days. Meat should be avoided, but eggs and milk used 
freely. Thorough mastication is of utmost importance. 

If the patient is obese, treatment for the obese must 
be followed. Give plenty of pure soft water between meals, 
and keep the skin in good active condition by careful bath- 
ing with soft water and neutral soap.

Eczema in Children A large number of cases of eczema 
occurring among children of the middle classes is due to de- 
fective nutrition ; unsuitability of foods, bad cooking and hur- 
ried breakfast. Children who are allowed to remain in bed to 
the very last minute, and then rush through breakfast and 
off to school, ruin their digestion at an early age. Such 
children frequently have boils ; if not, their skin becomes 
rough, the face covered with pimples, and the kidneys are 
more or less involved. 

Fruits should be used freely in the morning, stewed 
without sugar, or raw. If the luncheon is carried to school, 
give nut butters with bread, and a bottle of milk, or give 
whole wheat or brown bread sandwiches, and fruit, or nut 
bread sandwiches and fruit. The yolk of hard-boiled egg 
may now and then be grated over the bread and butter. 
They should drink plenty of water between meals. Such 
children should avoid at all times candies, sweets, meats, 
especially pork and veal, all rich dishes and meat soups, 
tea, coffee and chocolate. The bulk of their diet should 
be composed of milk and milk soups, puree of nuts, puree 
of green peas and spinach, tender green vegetables, fruits, 
eggs and whole wheat bread, well buttered. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



ALCOHOLISM 

In this disease, whether chronic or acute, the whole 
system is more or less poisoned, the mucous lining of the 
stomach is inert and inactive, gastric catarrh is frequently 
established, and the mucous membranes of the stomach are 
thickened and hardened. Such lesions as cirrhosis of the 
liver, kidney complications, thickening of the arterial walls, 
and a form of bronchitis, may be expected. A bronchial 
and stomach cough, especially in the early morning, is fre- 
quently present, and morning vomitings are to be expected. 
The intestines may be more or less affected, but as a rule 
do not share the marked conditions of the stomach. 

Acute alcoholism is more easily remedied by diet than 
is the disease when it has reached the chronic stage. 

In mild cases, easily-digested foods are called for, and 
while it is true highly-seasoned foods increase and keep 
up the appetite, they are in the end injurious. Of what 
value is an appetite if the stomach itself has no power to 
digest the food eaten? Water, water, and plenty of it, is 
the quickest and safest remedy. Pure water will answer 
every purpose, but if the patient objects, give him Vichy, 
Seltzer or Apollinaris at any time during the day or night. 
Fruit juices, especially orange and apple juice, may be used 
freely ; they allay thirst and the craving for liquor, and 
give a foundation on which to build a rational diet. Diet 
must be non-stimulating. A cup of black coffee in the early 
morning may be followed in an hour by a soft egg, or a 
glass of buttermilk, or koumys, and in the middle of the 
morning, fruit juice. If solid foods are admissible, give 
for dinner a broiled chop or scraped beef cake with a piece 
of hard, dry toast, well buttered, all to be eaten slowly 
and thoroughly masticated. Give no liquids with the 
meal. In two and a half or three hours give more fruit 
juice and Vichy, or an effervescing water. If there is un- 
easiness and a desire for alcohol, give liquid foods every two 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 155 

hours ; this will prevent the craving. Oysters, tripe, sweet- 
bread, carefully-boiled rice, pulled bread, milk and soda, 
milk and Vichy, are all to be recommended. In the middle 
of the afternoon, say four o'clock, give a cup of carefully- 
made tea, without sugar or cream, or a cup of mate ; I find 
the latter most beneficial in cases of alcoholism ; it is not 
wise, however, to use it more than once a day, and never 
with meals. The last meal at night should be varied ; give 
leban, buttermilk, eggnog without liquor, albumin and milk, 
koumys, junket, junket whey. Keep up the variety, it will 
induce the patient to eat and forget alcohol. 

In severe cases, feed every three hours during the 
day, starting at seven o'clock in the morning. In place of 
coffee in the early morning, substitute the juice of two 
oranges, or a grape fruit, or pomegranate. In the middle of 
the morning substitute for Vichy now and then a lime or 
lemonade. As soon as possible get rid of condiments, and 
never begin with rich sauces, or soups, or overseasoned 
dishes. As the patient progresses, increase the vegetable 
diet and cut down the animal foods, giving meat but once 
a day. Well-cooked cereals, with subacid fruits, as baked 
bananas, stewed prunes, peaches, served with cream ; baked 
potatoes, boiled rice, eggs and milk toast, should form the 
supper dishes. Where stimulants are called for, tea is fre- 
quently borne in the early morning better than coffee. If 
vomiting occurs, give a cup of very weak tea, or clam broth, 
or oyster bouillon ; later give an egg flip ; in two hours a 
cup of beef tea ; the next two hours a cup of peptonized or 
predigested milk, or a cup of leban or buttermilk ; the next 
two hours, beef juice on a piece of toast; next a cup cus- 
tard or a cup of Meiggs' food. 

Avoid excessive eating at meals, and do not give solid 
foods between meals. 



156 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM 

When the disease reaches the chronic stage, the crav- 
ing and longing for alcohol overpowers the better mental 
conditions and interferes with the selection of food and the 
appetite. Highly-seasoned beef teas, strong coffee, with 
lemonade, may be resorted to now and then, but such foods 
are a mistake; they increase rather than allay the demand 
for liquor. The writer has found a never-failing remedy 
in pure fruit juices, especially strained orange juice. The 
hours of feeding will be governed by the doctor and nurse. 
Give at seven o'clock a cup of black coffee, or a grape fruit, 
or pomegranate, or orange juice, milk and Vichy, milk and 
lime water, or a glass of lemonade. For the two-hour feed- 
ings use milk and milk preparations, broth, beef tea and 
fruit juice until light, easily-digested foods can be borne, 
As the patient progresses, increase the vegetable diet ; give 
meats but once a day, and that at noon. Well-cooked cereals, 
with stewed prunes without skins ; peach puree with cream ; 
baked potato ; milk soups ; boiled rice ; eggs ; milk toast. 
Suppers should be exceedingly light, without tea, coffee or 
chocolate. Where stimulants are constantly on the mind 
of the patient, tea is frequently borne in the early morn- 
ing better than coffee, and still better, a cup of mate. 
If vomiting follows the morning cough, give immediately 
an egg flip; if this is not retained give a cup of weak tea, 
or a cup of beef tea, or a cup of peptonized or predigested 
milk. A good arrangement is to follow the cup of weak 
tea in two hours with a cup of beef tea ; the next two hours, 
four ounces of peptonized or predigested milk ; the next 
two hours, four ounces of leban or buttermilk; the next, 
beef juice on a piece of toast, about one ounce of beef 
juice, and one ounce of toast ; the next two hours, egg and 
milk; the next, two ounces of Meiggs' food. Let the 
evening meal be six ounces of mutton broth, thickened with 
rice flour. At ten o'clock, when the patient is getting ready 
for bed, give him four ounces of warm milk, one-third 



MRS. RORER S DIET FOR THE SICK 



157 



barley water. If feeding is necessary during the night, use 
peptonized milk. 

If milk becomes objectionable, substitute malted milk, 
junket, plain plum porridge, milk gruels, milk and vege- 
table soups. When solid food can be borne, give two 
ounces of scraped meat, made into a cake and broiled ; 
broiled sweetbread or broiled mutton cake. After the meat 
has been thoroughly masticated and swallowed, give a 
glass of Vichy. The whites of two eggs shaken with a half 
pint of milk, with a piece of zweiback, makes a good supper. 
If the patient is restless during the night give hot milk at 
intervals of two hours; it will frequently induce comfort 
and sleep. If there is a constant desire for alcohol, and the 
loss is severely felt and produces nervousness, give a glass 
of half ginger ale and half Apollinaris.

DELIRIUM TREMENS 

While this comes truly under the head of alcoholism, 
it requires special dietetic treatment. Make sure that the 
alimentary canal is thoroughly emptied of all foods before 
you begin the feeding. Where both the chemical and the 
mechanical conditions of digestion are slack, food is fre- 
quently held until abnormal fermentations take place, the 
mass decomposes in the intestines and the patient is pre- 
vented from rapid recovery. The physician will probably 
give a brisk purgative; after this has thoroughly operated, 
give two tablespoonfuls of good, strong clam broth ; in one 
hour give two ounces of beef tea, the next two hours two 
ounces of clam broth, the next two hours two ounces of 
milk ; these may be alternated every two hours, for at least 
twenty-four hours. Water, of course, must be given freely. 
If all goes well, at the end of the first day, the patient will 
be able to digest the yolk of an egg shaken with milk, a cup 
of consomme, a cup of double-strength beef tea, Bartho- 
low's perfect food, a glass of koumys, two ounces of mat- 
zoon or zoolak, eggnog with or without liquor, according to 
the physician's orders, egg flip, Meiggs' food, arrowroot 
milk gruel or plum porridge. If the stomach is irritated and 
there is a great desire for alcohol, give orange or apple 
juice. As the patient convalesces, give a scraped beef 
cake, carefully-broiled chops, soft-boiled eggs, broiled or 
creamed sweetbreads, or stewed tripe and oysters, with 
baked potatoes, carefully-boiled rice, well-cooked farina 
or Cream of Wheat, carefully-made corn souffle, pulled 
bread, toast, or whole wheat bread. Orange juice early in 
the morning and in the middle of the afternoon in fact the 
patient can take the juice of six oranges a day to advantage. 

Cinnamon or ginger tea, as well as ginger ale, fre- 
quently allay the desire for stimulants ; this is also true 
of lemon and tamarind whey, mulled buttermilk, and 
koumys. 



160 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

THE INSANE 

Insane patients who have been illy-nourished must 
be liberally fed. The first effort should be to increase the 
weight of the body. Cream, olive oil, broiled bacon, plenty 
of butter on the bread, are of primary importance. All 
foods should be concentrated. 

Three hard-boiled yolks grated over a dish of milk 
toast, eggs and milk, puree of beans, peas and lentils, 
mutton broth and milk soups rather than meat, should be 
depended upon. If necessary resort to two-hour feedings 
of milk and barley water, milk and egg, giving two quarts 
of milk and six eggs a day. Where the patient refuses to 
eat and muSt be fed by forced feeding, adhere to milk and 
eggs, or milk and white of eggs, then milk and yolk of egg. 

When "softening" or "hardening" of the brain occurs 
accompanied by an increase in weight, give a simple non- 
stimulating vegetable diet. Weak tea, coffee or chocolate 
can be given once a day. Avoid red meats.

CANCER 

I feel in writing diet for this disease a fullness of 
experience, as I have had charge in my own family of sev- 
eral persons with this malady. One thing is certain all 
dishes made from cornmeal or from tomatoes are, as a rule, 
objectionable. A purely vegetable diet, with such foods as 
eggs and milk, seems to be indicated. Light fatty foods 
are good cream, butter, olive oil and cocoanut fats are 
to be preferred. Fruit juices may be used in early morn- 
ing. Strong tea and coffee, as well as chocolate, must be 
avoided. Weak tea, with cream and no sugar, is not objec- 
tionable in the middle of the afternoon. Hard, crisp bread, 
pulled bread, crackers, Virginia biscuits, and Uneedas are 
preferable to soft bread made after the ordinary fashion. 

Breakfasts Four tablespoonfuls of Cream of Wheat 
or other cereal, with cream. Baked potato, daintily served 
with a little cream or butter. Bird's nest egg, with a piece 
of whole wheat bread and butter. Poached egg on toast. 
Milk toast. Toasted rusk with milk. Do not give eggs 
more than twice a week. 

Dinners Puree of potato; puree of lentils; soup a la 
Reine, or two ounces of finely-chopped white meat of 
chicken, with a baked potato. Two ounces of finely-minced 
lamb, with boiled rice. Two ounces 'of finely-minced white 
meat of chicken, with stewed macaroni. Two ounces of 
creamed sweetbreads, with rice and a few green peas. 
Cream of peanut, green pea or celery soup, with bread. 

Suppers Fruits, carefully cooked, as baked apples, 
stewed prunes, bread and butter. Tender green salad, with 
French dressing. Stewed prunes, with rice. Baked peach, 
with rice. Arrowroot gruel, with toast. Milk toast. Milk 
toast with hard-boiled yolk of egg grated over it, or cream 
soups. 

Between breakfast and luncheon raw fruit or fruit 
juices may be used freely. Between dinner and supper, weak 
tea, with bread and butter, or cooked fruits and fruit

juices; or the top of a shredded wheat biscuit, toasted, with 
fruit juices. This diet must, of course, be continued as 
long as the patient lives. Keep up a variety of simple 
dishes. At one time let the potato be mashed plain, at 
another time made into "puff" and baked, plain or stuffed ; 
or baked, mashed and made into roses, using a pastry bag 
and star tube; brown these in a quick oven and serve on 
a dainty plate. Lentils may be soaked over night, washed 
and boiled until tender, pressed through a colander, sea- 
soned with butter and salt, and baked in an individual 
casserole. Old peas and beans may be served the same way. 
In arranging the menus for a person with cancer, give 
white meat of chicken twice a week, lentils or nut foods 
twice a week, and the remaining days let the patient live 
strictly on fruits and cereals, or milk and toasts, or whole 
wheat bread and light green salads.

LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA 

This disease calls for a generous, simple, nutritious 
diet rich in fatty matter. Patients should drink two and 
a half quarts of plain cool, not iced, water each day. If 
ordinary water is objected to, buy some non-effervescing 
bottled water; a patient will frequently take a water that 
comes from a drug store, even if it has no special medicinal 
value, rather than drink water from an ordinary spigot. 
Digestion must be kept in good condition. Sometimes it 
becomes necessary to give small quantities of food, divided 
into four or five meals a day. The diet must be especially 
non-stimulating. 

Before breakfast give the patient two or three ounces 
of orange juice, or an after-dinner cup of black coffee, or 
an after-dinner cup of grape juice, or half of a grape fruit. 

MAY EAT 

Breakfasts Poached eggs on bacon ; boiled eggs, with 
well-buttered bread; broiled bacon with whole wheat 
bread; wheat germ cereal, well cooked, with cream; farina 
and cream ; Cream of Wheat, with cream ; two broiled 
chops, with one corn gem; broiled young chicken, with 
pulled bread. 

Dinners Puree of lentils, baked potato and well-but- 
tered bread, followed by cup custard ; boiled, baked or 
broiled mutton or lamb ; stewed chicken ; plain omelets ; 
omelets garnished with oysters, peas, or with tomato sauce ; 
nut roll ; beef cakes, broiled ; baked potatoes ; boiled rice ; 
spaghetti stewed in stock; cucumbers or squash, stuffed 
with meat ; young green peas ; young tender lima beans ; 
artichokes ; very young carrots, spinach, cauliflower, cress, 
lettuce, tender celery ; fresh fruits. 

Suppers Bread and milk ; toasted rusk and milk ; eggs 
and milk, with pulled bread ; cream soups and bread ; broth 
with rice or barley ; cereals ; milk toast ; milk preparations ; 
buttermilk, brown bread ; leban, a little honey and toast. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 165 

EPILEPSY 

It is generally conceded by all physicians and dietitians 
that diet plays a most important part in the alleviation 
and cure of this disease. It has been observed that epileptic 
attacks in childhood almost invariably follow a heavy meal 
of indigestible or over-stimulating highly-seasoned foods. 
A purely vegetable diet will frequently cure epilepsy. Sub- 
stitute milk, carefully-made nut dishes, old peas, beans and 
lentils, for meats. All leguminous seeds are rich in nitro- 
gen, but must be carefully cooked to be digestible. 

In feeding an epileptic, first consider the digestibility 
of the food, next the correct amount for the individual. 
There must be just enough to nourish the body, but not an 
ounce too much. Overfeeding will nearly always produce 
an attack. There must be no eating between meals. If 
light meat, as white meat of chicken or lamb, is served at 
a meal, that meal must be free from milk; and this diet 
must be continued or kept up perhaps during the indi- 
vidual's life. 

MAY EAT 

Broiled, baked or roasted lamb Grated carrots, cooked in water, 
Chicken cream and salt added, as a puree 

Broiled white-fleshed fish Lettuce 

Hard-boiled yolk of egg on milk Cress 

toast Endive 

Milk and milk preparations Fresh fruits, with the exception of 
Dishes made from old peas, beans pears and cantaloupes 

and lentils Prunes, prune dishes 

Baked and boiled potatoes Well-cooked cereals 

Boiled rice Tapioca and fruit 

Macaroni or spaghetti Tapioca custards 

Boiled chestnuts in season Whole wheat bread 

New green peas Stale bread 

New green corn, pressed from cob Crackers 

Stewed squash Wafers 

Stewed pumpkin Toast, milk toast 

Spinach Toasted rusks and milk 

Cauliflower Mush bread 

Celery Corn bread occasionally 



166 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

These dishes may be arranged after this fashion : oat- 
meal mush and milk for breakfast; a piece of whole wheat 
bread, well buttered. Dinner: a little roasted or boiled 
lamb or mutton, carefully-cooked spinach, a baked potato, 
followed by fruit tapioca, rice pudding, or some dessert 
without milk or eggs. Supper: milk toast, fresh fruits, 
with bread and butter, or mush and milk, or bread and 
milk, and now and then a broiled or panned tomato with 
cream sauce and a bit of corn bread. Meat must never 
be given more than two or three times a week. As fish 
comes in fresh on Thursday for Friday, a piece of broiled 
fish on Friday gives variety. 



ERYSIPELAS 

The intense inflammation of the skin in this disease 
indicates a diet free from the proteids of meat. 

The writer has had success with a simple diet of milk 
gruels, infants' foods, with eggs, milk, nut milks, milk and 
vichy water. This diet changes, when the patient is con- 
valescing, to carefully-cooked farina, Cream of Wheat, 
well-baked whole wheat bread, milk toast, egg toast, 
coddled eggs, cup custards, junket, koumys, leban, matzoon ; 
followed later by a broiled chop, a broiled chicken, baked 
potato, carefully-boiled rice, whole wheat bread, fruits, 
spinach, cress or lettuce. Do not allow the patient to 
return too quickly to a meat diet; he must also avoid all 
fried foods, coarse vegetables, pies, puddings, rich sauces, 
liquors, both malt and alcoholic, strong coffee, tea and 
chocolate, and meat soups, in fact all soups at the beginning 
of meals ; fruits stewed with sugar, cookies, cakes, candies, 
and pickles. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 167 

INSOMNIA 

A heavy meal at night, a cup of strong tea or chocolate, 
are frequently responsible for a sleepless night. 

If sleeplessness has become a habit, put the patient 
on a regular, easily-digested diet, and give rest until the 
conditions are relieved. Give a glass of hot water the first 
thing in the morning ; breakfast in bed, composed of cereal 
with cream or milk, and rest for an hour if possible. After 
the bath, give a glass of buttermilk, or zoolak, or plain milk. 
For dinner at noon, give boiled, baked or broiled beef, 
mutton or chicken, a baked potato or rice, one green vege- 
table, simply cooked, as spinach, cauliflower, asparagus or 
tender celery ; a lettuce or endive salad with French dress- 
ing; no dessert. Supper at six; milk toast, Cream of 
Wheat, gluten mush and milk, well-made cornmeal mush, 
egg dishes and a little bread only. If the patient is anaemic, 
or what people call "run down," give two raw eggs between 
breakfast and dinner, or one egg beaten with a half pint 
of milk, and another between dinner and supper. If eggs 
and milk become tiresome, give buttermilk, koumys, zoolak, 
junket or any of the milk gruels. Give a cup of hot milk at 
bedtime. 



168 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



ADDISON'S DISEASE 

In the early stages of the disease there is always a 
decided weakness of the entire digestive system. As the 
disease advances, vomiting frequently becomes rather 
dangerous, and requires first attention. Clam broth, made 
from fresh clams, given in teaspoonful doses, will almost 
always allay the vomiting; it seems to be able to draw the 
digestive secretions into the stomach more readily than 
other foods. If the vomiting stops, give the patient a 
small amount of predigested milk, or milk and barley 
water. It is wise to use a straw or glass tube for feeding 
or give it by teaspoonfuls. Well-flavored mutton tea and 
mutton broth, egg soups, egg flip, are frequently easily 
borne. The patient should be fed every two hours, but 
should not be urged to take more than is agreeable. Over- 
feeding in this disease is always productive of bad results. 

The following list may be arranged in two-hour feedings 

Milk and rice water, in proper- Beef broth strained into a table- 

tions of two-thirds milk and spoonful of mashed baked po- 

one-third rice water tato 

Milk and arrowroot water gruel Rennet milk 

Milk and barley water Junket 

Almond milk Leban 

Egg flip Matzoon 

Milk shake Koumys 

Yolk of egg and milk Modified milk 

Milk flavored with cinnamon "Ye perfect food" 

Oatmeal gruel added to milk Soup a la Royal 

Tiger's milk Bartholow's restorative soup 

Wine whey Eggnog 

Strained mutton broth Peptonized milk 

Then follow with cream soups, with croutons, or a scraped 
beef cake, or a tender broiled chop ; and go gradually on 
to an easily-digested, normal diet, free from sweets, sours, 
or grease. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 169 

DIET AFTER AN ANESTHETIC 

If vomiting occurs after administration of ether or 
chloroform, do not give food for several hours. A table- 
spoonful of clam broth, given in teaspoonful doses, will 
probably be retained and give a foundation for a little food 
later on. A few tablespoonfuls of coffee, in teaspoonful 
doses, is frequently beneficial. Then give a cup of chicken 
broth; almond milk; milk and barley water; alternating 
with Meiggs' food or modified milk, for the next two or 
three days. Then, under ordinary circumstances, the 
patient may have milk toast, a poached egg, a beef cake, 
or broiled chop. If vomiting continues, however, stop all 
foods except small quantities of albumin water, modified 
milk and clam broth. The patient usually has enough 
irregularities to contend with without added indigestion. 



PART II 

RECIPES 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 173 



PROPRIETARY FOODS 

Under this heading the writer has placed prepared 
foods that are manufactured, the secret of which is sup- 
posed to be patented. Some of them contain a large 
amount of nourishment in small bulk. Some are prepara- 
tions of beef, others the casein of milk, gluten, and easily- 
digested forms of starch. Whether or not these foods are 
beneficial will be decided by your physician or nurse. 

All the foods mentioned under this heading, or in the 
book, have been used by the writer, and can be depended 
upon as correct. 

The Kellogg Food Company, of Battle Creek, Mich- 
igan, make an eighty percent gluten biscuit and gluten 
flour, both of which have but a trace of starch and are 
perfectly safe to use in diabetic feeding. 

Their sterilized wheat bran is clean and ready to use 
for the diabetic bran loaf, or to add to ordinary whole wheat 
or white flour for laxative bread. This same company also 
makes Granola, Granose Flakes, Whole Wheat, Toasted 
Corn and Rye Flakes, Gelose, a vegetable gelatin, Nut 
Mixtures, Almond Meal, Cocoanut Sticks and some pure 
starch preparations. The writer has used these prepara- 
tions for a number of years, and found them satisfactory, 
well prepared and clean. 

Maltose, a predigested food, represents thoroughly- 
digested starch of cereals. It may be used in the place of 
cornstarch or rice flour. The flavor is agreeable, and it is 
considered a fat-forming food par excellence, and in gastric 
or other stomach trouble, with milk, it gives a well-pre- 
pared and palatable diet. 

Gluten Flour Gluten flour and similar products sold 

Bunder the name of "diabetic foods," are frequently rich in 

starch, the very substance we are trying to get rid of in 

diabetic feeding. Some gluten flours sold in the markets 



174 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

of the United States, advertised as "pure gluten," contain 
as much as forty percent, starch, and not more than thirty- 
five percent, protein. They are really poor ordinary bread 
flours. 

Quoting from an article in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association, March 22, 1913, will show how the 
medical profession feel towards these preparations: 

"Gluten flours are, as a rule, prescribed only for 
diabetics to whom the starch content is of the utmost im- 
portance. A physician tells his patient to use a gluten 
flour not because that product is rich in protein but because 
it is (supposedly) poor in carbohydrates. The great 
majority of so-called gluten flours and gluten foods sold in 
this country contain dangerously high percentages of carbo- 
hydrates, and the manufacturers do their best to keep both 
physician and patient in ignorance of this fact. In the case 
of gluten flours of legal standard, the protein content is 
emphasized and made the main selling point. The subject 
of starch content is studiously avoided, and it becomes 
necessary to write letters to the manufacturers specifically 
asking for the carbohydrate content of their products, 
which may then be grudgingly, and not always truthfully, 
given." 

Again, Doctor Janeway writes : "From my experience, 
I say without hesitation, that 'gluten bread' is the diabetic's 
worst enemy. Taught by the dealer, or worse yet, by the 
physician, not only that it is safe for him to eat, but some- 
times even that it is actually a cure for the disease, he eats 
it in large quantities * * *." 

Henry Heide, New York, makes an almond paste, 12.7 
percent, protein, 47.7 percent, nitrogen free extract and 
fibre, 20.0 fat, ether extract, and only a trace of starch. It 
can be purchased in one and five pound tins at any first- 
class grocery. Recipes for the use of almond paste will be 
found in Part Second of this book. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 175 

Aleuronat Aleuronat is the gluten flour made from 
the aleuron layer of the wheat kernel. According to recent 
analysis, it is starch free, and contains eighty percent, of 
digestible proteids. It is made in Germany, sold by Lehn 
& Fink, wholesale druggists, New York. Recipes for the 
use of aleuronat will be found in Part Second. 

Aleuronat zweiback, R. Hundhausen and Hamm, 
contains sixty-six percent, protein matter, and not a trace 
of starch. Even their "low gluten zweiback" does not con- 
tain starch. , 

The American Dehydrating Company, Waukesha, 
Wisconsin, dehydrates certain fruits and vegetables, which 
makes them entirely different from ordinary dried fruits. 
In out-of-town places, and the far West, these are most 
valuable in diet for the sick. The fruits and vegetables 
are dried so rapidly that the* cell structures are not 
destroyed. When soaked in water and carefully cooked, 
they have the flavor of fresh fruits and vegetables, which 
makes them far more appetizing than the ordinary dried 
fruits purchased in the market. An excellent point is that 
these goods are put into small tin cans in the room in which 
they are dehydrated. Dirt and air cannot penetrate, and 
they are absolutely clean. 

Akoll Biscuits, Huntley & Palmer, London, contain, 
according to recent analysis, fifty-four percent, protein 
and not a trace of starch. It seems to me, with these 
various preparations that are easily obtained in our market, 
the question of bread for the diabetic patient is settled. 

Roman Meal Made by the Roman Meal Company, 
Duluth, Minnesota, is an excellent cure for chronic consti- 
pation. Use ordinary recipes for muffins, gems, bannocks, 
substituting Roman meal for one-half the quantity of flour. 

Saccharin I mention saccharin simply to condemn it. 
If diabetic patients cannot give up sugar and starch, they 
alone are responsible for the consequences. . The nurse 
and physician should fix in the mind of the patient that his 



176 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

life depends on a restricted diet, and that a cure needs his 
cooperation. Saccharin, even in small quantities, has in 
my hands, sooner or later, provoked digestive troubles, and 
these troubles have caused as much anxiety as the first 
disease. Sugar has a high food value ; saccharin has no 
food value. It in no way takes the place of sugar, nor is 
it condensed sugar. 



Roborat A vegetable protein manufactured from hard 
corn, hard wheat and unpolished rice. It makes a fine 
tasteless flour that is easily soluble in cold water. This 
is used in cases of rheumatism, gout and Bright's disease. 
It does not, in the proces's of digestion, increase the excre- 
tion of uric acids. 

Somatose is a predigested meat ; it is highly nutritious 
and is usually well borne in gastric disturbances. 

Beef Meal is meat partly digested by a ferment ob- 
tained from the pineapple (bromelin}. According to the 
analysis of Chittenden, it contains seventy-seven percent, 
of protein, thirteen of fat. The proteins are chiefly in the 
form of albumoses and peptones. The preparation is usually 
added to hot milk, or beef tea, or water, or in some cases, 
to cocoa. I find it acceptable to most patients when added 
to broth. To milk and cocoa it is frequently objectionable. 

Dried Nuttrose A prepared casein of milk, sold in the 
ordinary drug shops. 

Soy Flour The Health Food Company, of New York, 
make a soy flour that contains but a trace of starch. It may 
be made into mush or gems for diabetic patients. Recipes 
for its use will be found in Part Second of this book. 

Dried Egg .Albumin may be purchased at any drug 
store, but it is easily made at home. Put the whites of 
three or four eggs on a meat plate, in front of an open oven 
door. Watch carefully, and as soon as the water evap- 
orates, take the crisp albumin from the plate, make sure 
it is perfectly dry, and put it into jars or bottles to keep. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 177 

This has high food value, and may be added, just as it is, 
to beef tea, or chicken broth, or to milk or whey, about a 
level tablespoonful to a pint. 

Fairchild Brothers and Foster, of New York, make 
several excellent predigested foods, and material for the 
peptonizing process. Recipes and directions for their use 
will be found in Part Second of this book. 

Eskay's Food, made by the Smith, Kline and French 
Company, of Philadelphia, is an admirable food for young 
children and invalids. 

We have a large number of other proprietary foods 
intended as substitutes for milk for infants and invalids, 
which are out of the province of this book. Under Infant 
Feeding we have given foods with which we have been 
successful. If other foods are used, the responsibility must 
be taken by a physician. Many of the so-called infant foods 
are very unlike mothers' milk ; they contain too little fat 
and a large percentage of carbohydrates; and I am suffi- 
ciently old-fashioned to believe that the test tube analysis 
is not always a perfect and final guide to either a correct 
diet or the quantity to be given at a feeding. The digestive 
tract in different individuals varies so greatly that the 
digestibility and adaptability of food for each infant is an 
all-important question.

METHODS OF COOKERY 

ROASTING Roasting means to expose one side of an 
article to an intense heat, and the other to the air. Our 
grandmothers roasted beef on a spit, which turned con- 
stantly before a hot fire. In these days we call baking 
"roasting;" the two, however, are widely different. 

BROILING Broiling is precisely the same as roast- 
ing. One side is exposed to the fire, the other to the air. 
This produces a sweet flavor not attainable in an oven. 

BAKING This is a common method of cooking in 
the oven. Meat, potatoes, apples, pies, breads, cakes, are 
all baked. 

For meats, the oven must at first be very hot, to coag- 
ulate the juices on the outside, and to prevent the escape 
of those within. The first half hour the heat must be ex- 
treme, then cool and cook at a lower temperature, fifteen 
minutes to each pound, basting every ten minutes with the 
fat in the pan. Do not add water. 

BOILING To boil an article, it must be immersed 
in boiling water. 

Green vegetables should be put over the fire in boiling 
salted water. 

Underground vegetables and rice should be boiled in 
unsalted water, and salted after they are cooked. 

To boil meat, plunge it in a kettle of boiling water, boil 
twenty minutes, until the juices are coagulated on the out- 
side, cool the water to 180 Fahr. and continue the cooking, 
fifteen minutes to each pound of meat; ,ten minutes, if the 
piece is small. Add salt when the meat is partly done. 
Boiled meats are more easily digested than meats baked or 
roasted, but are not so tasty, as they lack the scorched taste 
created by the intense heat. Meat, if properly boiled, will 
be rare and juicy. 

STEWING This name is given to dishes composed 
of small pieces of meat cooked or steeped in a rich sauce 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 181 

until tender. The pieces are usually browned in fat, which 
makes them less digestible than broiled or boiled meats. 
Stews really have very little place in diet for the sick. 

WARMING OVER The second cooking of meats 
toughens the fibre and hardens the albumin, which makes 
them rather difficult of digestion. 

Hash, as usually made and served, is an abomination. 
Even a healthy person, with good digestion, will carry his 
breakfast hash, undigested, until nearly noonday. Some 
meats, however, must be cooked before they are finally 
dressed. Sweetbreads and tripe must be well cooked and 
put aside, and dressed at serving time. They are not 
classed with warmed-over meats. Boudins, cooked over 
hot water, can be taken, as a rule, by invalids, children or 
the aged. 

FRYING Immersing in hot fat has no place in diet 
for the sick. 

SAUTEING This, like frying, is one of the most ob- 
jectionable ways of preparing foofl, and has no place in diet 

for the sick. 

PLANKING This is broiling on a plank. Fish, 
steak, chickens, may be planked to give variety, and if the 
plank is nicely garnished, they are the most sightly of the 
meat dishes. 

STEAMING To steam an article, put it in a steamer, 
stand it over hot water and keep the water boiling continu- 
ously until the article is cooked. Potatoes, rice, cabbage, 
may all be steamed, and are frequently better than when 
boiled. 

PAPER BAG COOKERY This is simply baking in 
a sealed bag; in this way all the juices and flavorings are 
retained, and the articles cooked are more tasty. Fish, 
chickens, sweetbreads, steak, are excellent when cooked in 
a bag. Prunes and fresh fruits cooked in a bag retain 
their flavor and color. 



182 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

BRAIZING This is cooking in a double pan. Tough 
meats are put in the under pan, hot water added, then cov- 
ered with the upper pan or lid, and cooked in the oven until 
tender. A sort of cross between a boil and a bake. 

CODDLING Coddling means to cook in boiling 
water until the food is partly done. Coddled eggs are 
eggs cooked in water below the boiling point ; the white 
is congealed, but not hard. Coddled apples are soft, but 
not soft enough to fall apart.

SOUPS 

The first and most important point in making good soup 
is to use the best of materials. 

To give meat soup the slightest food value, we must 
change the solid meat into liquid form. To do this, the fibre 
must be softened, the juices and blood drawn out, and 
the gelatin which exists in the bone, cartilage, membranes 
and skin, and the mineral matter, dissolved. Cold, soft water 
should be used. Soft water is best because it softens the 
fibre, which allows the juice to escape more easily. The 
albumin coagulates at a low temperature, which makes it 
necessary to cook the soup far below the boiling point. 

The second point, the utensils, is also of importance. 
The juices of meat are acid, and if soup is made in a tin or 
iron kettle, it will have a peculiar, unpleasant flavor, which 
is sure to be detected by the sick, as their taste is always 
acute. Use an ordinary porcelain lined or granite kettle, 
with a close-fitting lid, and for straining, a granite colander 
or a French puree sieve. For the last straining, use two 
thicknesses of cheese cloth. 

To prevent too great evaporation, and to keep out the 
odors of other cooking in the kitchen, keep the kettle covered 
from the beginning to the end of the cooking. 

As the water reaches 200 Fahr. you will notice a 
fine, fibrous net throughout the liquid ; in a moment it comes 
to the surface. This is the albumin, drawn out by the cold 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 183 

water now coagulating under the influence of the heat. As 
it comes to the surface, it brings with it any floating par- 
ticles that may be in the water, which clarifies or clears! 
the soup. Skim this off, and reduce the heat of the water 
to 180 Fahr. 

Rapid boiling clouds soup. 

Cooking at too low a temperature spoils the flavor. 

Meat soups contain a very small amount of nourishment. 

A perfectly clear soup is not nutritious; it contains 
only the soluble mineral matter of the meat and the flavor- 
ing. The albumin you have strained out, and the fibre has 
not been dissolved. Beef tea, beef essence and beef soups 
are, however, valuable adjuncts to diet for the sick; they 
give flavor to other materials, and are stimulating. 

Soups are divided into three classes : perfectly clear, 
stimulating soups, with but a trace of nourishment ; clear 
soups that have farinaceous substances added, moderately 
nourishing; and nutritious soups, made from milk, meat 
stock and vegetables, or from milk and vegetable substances 
alone. 

For clear beef soup and broth, a portion of the shin is 
to be preferred ; for beef tea, beef extract, the sticking piece 
is first choice; the lean round or rump second. Meat for 
soup or beef tea should be as free from fat as possible ; for 
broth, beef may be used alone or in combination with mut- 
ton, veal or chicken. 

A true consomme, the most expensive of clear soups, 
should be made from veal and beef, and to give it an especial 
flavor for the sick, add the carcase of a roasted chicken. 

Prolonged soaking in cold water will draw out the juices 
and flavoring quite equal to long cooking. 

STOCK 

Purchase a shin of beef, have it sawed into four lengths, 
remove the meat from the bone, put the bones into the 
bottom of the kettle, the meat on top, cover with four 



184 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

quarts of cold water, bring slowly to boiling point and 
skim. Push the kettle to the back of the stove, or put it 
over the simmering burner, to cook for three hours. Add 
one onion with six cloves stuck in it, one bay leaf, a half 
teaspoonful of crushed celery seed or a few celery tops, a 
carrot cut into pieces, a tablespoonful of salt and a dash 
of Tabasco sauce. Cook slowly one hour longer, and strain 
through a colander; stand aside in a cold place. In the 
morning remove every particle of fat from the surface. The 
stock should now form a perfectly clear, solid jelly; reheat 
the jelly, add two whites of eggs, slightly beaten, and a 
tablespoonful of lemon juice. Bring to boiling point, boil 
rapidly five minutes and strain through two thicknesses of 
cheesecloth wrung from cold water. Stand aside in a cold 
place, and use as wanted. 

This may be served perfectly clear, as it is, cold or hot ; 
or nutritious materials may be added. 

SOUP a la ROYAL 
One Serving 

Beat one egg, without separating, until well mixed ; add 
a tablespoonful of clear stock, pour into a cup, stand the cup 
in a pan of boiling water and cook until the custard is "set." 
Turn it out of the cup, cut it into dice, put them in the soup 
plate or bouillon cup, fill the cup or plate with hot clear soup, 
and serve at once. 



CLEAR SOUP WITH BREAD BLOCKS 

One Serving 

Cut a slice of bread into dice, put them in the oven to 
dry, without browning. Beat an egg, without separating, 
add the bread dice, and stir until each piece is thoroughly 
covered with egg. Heat one cupful of clear stock, add the 
bread blocks, boil a half minute and serve. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 185 

PORTUGUESE SOUP 
One Serving 

Soak six prunes in a half cupful of cold water over 
night; in the morning add half a pint of stock, salt and 
pepper; bring to boiling point and push to the back of the 
stove where the soup will be hot, but not boil, for at least 
a half hour. Press through a sieve and serve with long 
fingers of toasted bread. 

BEEF TEA 

i pound of chopped lean beef i whole clove 

I pint of water J4 teaspoonful of salt 

i bay leaf 

Put the meat through a meat grinder, add all the other 
ingredients, and stand in a cold place for at least two hours, 
stirring now and then. Bring to boiling point, simmer 
gently thirty minutes, and strain through a fine sieve. 
Press the beef well. When cold, remove every particle of 
fat. 

QUICK BEEF TEA 

Chop or grind one pound of lean beef, sticking piece 
preferred ; add one pint of water and stir constantly for 
fifteen minutes. Stand it over a very quick fire, bring to 
boiling point and simmer gently a half hour. Strain 
through a fine sieve, pressing the meat quite dry. Add 
a half teaspoonful of salt. Draw a piece of blotting paper 
over the top of the tea, and reheat the quantity to be served. 

This may be flavored with port wine. 

SAVORY BEEF TEA 
Two Servings 

Yz pound of round steak }/2 teaspoonful of salt 

A saltspoonful of celery seed i pint of water 

Broil the meat quickly over a very hot fire, scorching, 
as it were, the outside; do this quickly so as to have the 



186 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

meat very rare. Cut it into tiny pieces, saving all the 
juice; put it in a saucepan with the cold water, bring to 
a boil and skim ; add the celery seed and salt, and simmer 
gently one hour. Strain, remove the fat, and it is ready 
to use. 

NUTRITIVE BEEF TEA 

Grind or chop fine one pound of lean beef, either the 
round or the sticking piece ; add one pint of water and stir 
continually for five minutes ; add a saltspoonful of crushed 
celery seed and one bay leaf; cover and stand it in the 
refrigerator or in a very cold place, over night if possible ; 
if not, two or three hours. Stand it on the fire, put in a 
thermometer and stir the mixture until it reaches 140 
Fahr. Strain through a coarse sieve, pressing the meat 
until it is dry. Return the "tea" to the saucepan, add the 
white of an egg, slightly beaten with a tablespoonful of 
water; heat to 130 Fahr. (just an instant), until the white 
of the egg comes to the surface, and strain through two 
thicknesses of cheese cloth wrung from cold water. 

If properly made, this will be a brilliant claret color, 
and will contain quite a considerable amount of nourish- 
ment. Great care must be taken after adding the white of 
egg not to heat the mixture over 130 Fahr. or it will be 
muddy and unsightly. 

STIMULATING BEEF TEA 
Four Servings 

Cover two pounds of chopped lean meat with a pint of 
cold water, stirring constantly for five minutes; soak for 
a half hour; bring to boiling point, boil rapidly five min- 
utes and strain. Add the beaten white of an egg, boil 
again and strain through two thicknesses of cheesecloth, 
put at once into a glass jar and stand in a cold place. One 
or two tablespoonfuls of this will frequently allay vomiting; 
it is quite stimulating, and may be used in place of either 
coffee or spirits. A little celery seed, a bay leaf, a clove or a 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 187 

blade of mace may be added at different times to change the 
general beef flavor, which is frequently unpleasant to the 
sick. By alternating these four flavors, you may surprise 
the patient with a new flavor each day ; for instance, one 
day, add a clove alone; another, the bay leaf; another, the 
blade of mace; another, the celery seed; then add two 
flavorings, at another time three, each time changing the 
combination. 

RESTORATIVE BEEF TEA 
Three Servings 

Y 2 pound of lean beef, chopped 3 drops of muriatic acid 

fine A saltspoonful of salt 

6 ounces of water 

Mix all the ingredients and stir them continuously 
for five minutes; stand in the refrigerator for one hour and 
strain through a very fine sieve, pressing all the juice from 
the meat. Put this at once in a cold place. 

If it is to be given warm, heat over hot water to 130 
Fahr. If the raw odor and taste of the "tea" is objection- 
able add a saltspoonful of crushed celery seed before strain- 
ing. The odor of celery is usually agreeable. 

BAKED BEEF TEA 

Three Servings 

Put one pound of ground lean beef, a half teaspoonful 
of salt, one and a half pints of cold water, and one table- 
spoonful of washed rice, into a covered dish ; stand the 
dish in a moderately quick oven and bake for an hour. 
Reduce the heat and continue the baking for three hours; 
strain and press. There should be one pint of beef tea 
after it is strained. 

This is valuable where a restricted diet is long con- 
tinued, and the flavor of ordinary beef tea or soup grows 
distasteful. 



188 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

BEEF ESSENCE 

Put a half pound of finely-chopped lean beef in an 
ordinary, clean fruit jar; add a half teaspoonful of salt, 
stand the jar in a saucepan of cold water or in a steamer, 
bring the water to boiling point and boil continuously for 
one hour. Strain through cheesecloth and add a grain of 
salt. 

At feeding time, put a tablespoonful or more, as 
directed, in a cup, stand the cup in boiling water until it 
is palatably hot. Serve cold in typhoid fever. 

HOMEMADE BEEF EXTRACT 

Cut one pound of lean beef (sticking piece preferred) 
into very small pieces, throw them into a shallow hot pan 
and shake over the fire until they are thoroughly seared; 
then put them through the meat grinder. Put this in a 
fruit jar, add a half pint of cold water, a saltspoonful of 
salt, a saltspoonful of crushed celery seed and a dash of 
black pepper; add two drops of dilute muriatic acid. Cover 
the jar, stand it in a saucepan of cold water, cover the 
saucepan, bring to a boil and boil continuously for two 
hours. Strain, pressing the meat very dry. Put the extract 
aside in a bottle or jar in a cold place. Use one or two 
tablespoonfuls in a cup of boiling water. 

BARTHOLOW'S RESTORATIVE SOUP 
FOR INVALIDS 

"Grind one pound of lean beef, add eight fluid ounces of 
soft or distilled water, five drops of pure hydrochloric acid 
and thirty grains of common salt; stir constantly for five 
minutes and stand aside for three hours. Then throw this 
on a sieve and let it run through with slight pressure ; on 
the flesh residue in the sieve pour two ounces of distilled 
water and let it run through, pressing the meat. There 
should be obtained from this operation ten fluid ounces of 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 189 

cold juice of a red color. A wineglassful, or one gill, should 
be used at a feeding. 

It must not be warmed, at least not to a greater degree 
than 120 Fahr. Since this liquid contains a considerable 
amount of albumin, it is rendered muddy by heat or alcohol. 

This is valuable in cases of continued fever or dysen- 
tery, and in all diseases attended with great prostration 
and weakness of the digestive organs. 

Do not give it to persons who have too free secretion 
of gastric juice." 

BARTHOLOW'S FOOD 

One Serving 

"2 ounces of beef tea I level tablespoonful of gran- 

The yolk of one egg ulated tapioca 

2 ounces of milk 

Soak the tapioca in the milk in a cold place over night, 
or for several hours ; next morning cook in a double boiler 
until the tapioca is transparent and add the beef tea. Pour 
while hot over the yolk of an egg, add a saltspoonful of 
salt, and if you like, a little celery seed or celery salt. 

This is exceedingly nutritious and very palatat>le. It 
should be about the consistency of well-cooked farina." 

BEEF JUICE 

Broil a half pound of round steak, searing it quickly 
on both sides. The steak should be one inch thick, and the 
broiling about five minutes. Put it on a hot plate, cut it 
into bits, and with a lemon squeezer, squeeze out all the 
juice into a cup that has been heated over hot water; add 
a grain of salt and serve at once. 

If this is to be kept warm, stand the cup in a pan of 
warm water; be careful, however, not to coagulate the juice. 



190 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

BEEF PANADA 

Three Servings 
I pound of lean beef chopped A saltspoonful of celery seed 

fine i slice of onion 

12 ounces of water i bay leaf 

Y^. teaspoonful of salt 

Mix the water and beef, and soak for two hours in a 
cold place; then add all the seasoning, stand the saucepan 
in another of boiling water and boil continuously for two 
hours. Strain in coarse sieve, rubbing through as much 
of the meat as possible. Serve hot with toasted bread. Six 
ounces of this furnish a full meat meal. 

BEEF BROTH 

Four Servings 

Purchase a half pound of well-cracked bones and a 
pound of lean beef. Chop the beef, or cut it fine, sear it 
well in a hot kettle, add the bones and one and a half 
quarts of cold water ; bring to boiling point and skim ; add 
two tablespoonfuls of rice, and simmer gently two hours; 
add one bay leaf and a half teaspoonful of celery salt; 
simmer gently a half hour longer, and strain. 

BEEF BROTH WITH BARLEY 

Four Servings 

Proceed as directed for beef broth. As soon as the 
mixture reaches the boiling point and you have thoroughly 
skimmed it, add two tablespoonfuls of pearled barley; strain 
this out at serving time. 

BEEF BROTH WITH SAGO 

Make the beef broth as directed in the first recipe ; 
strain it; when it is cold, remove every particle of fat. If 
the quantity for a single feeding is to be four ounces, allow 
a level teaspoonful of sago. Soak the sago in the cold 
soup for a half hour, bring it slowly to boiling point, and 
cook until the sago is transparent ; add salt and serve. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 191 

It must be remembered that all finely-divided starchy 
foods are not easily masticated and are more or less objec- 
tionable. Thoroughly cook the sago, and instruct the 
patient to masticate it. In fever cases, it is wise to strain 
all the particles of starchy foods from both milk and broth. 

BOUILLON 

I pound of lean meat J^ teaspoonful of salt 

I pint of water I bay leaf 

The white of one egg I whole clove 

i teaspoonful of sugar A saltspoonful of celery seed 

Put the sugar into a saucepan and stand it over a strong 
fire until it burns, then add the water and the meat; stir 
until they are well . mixed, add the seasonings, simmer 
gently for one 'hour, and strain. Beat the white of the egg 
slightly, add a teaspoonful of lemon juice, add this to the 
bouillon, boil rapidly five minutes and strain through two 
thicknesses of cheesecloth. 

This is appetizing, clear, brilliant and slightly stimu- 
lating, but is not nutritious. 

DOUBLE BOUILLON 

In cases of fever where stimulants of other kinds can- 
not be given, double bouillon is exceedingly valuable. 

Cover two pounds of lean meat, finely chopped, with 
one pint of cold water, stir it constantly for five minutes 
and stand it aside to soak for two hours. Put it in a double 
boiler, and allow the water surrounding the boiler to boil 
continuously for three hours ; then strain, pressing the 
meat. Use in small quantities, from one to two ounces 
at a feeding. 

BOUILLON JELLY 

Make bouillon according to the preceding recipe. After 
it has been clarified and is slightly cool, add a tablespoonful 
of granulated gelatin ; soak for fifteen minutes ; stir over 
the fire until the gelatin is dissolved and stand it aside for 
use. Serve cold as beef jelly. 



192 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

BOUILLON a la COLBERT 

Put one poached egg in the bottom of a bouillon cup, 
pour over nicely-seasoned hot bouillon and serve. 

SEMI-SOLID BEEF 

y 2 pound of lean beef ^ teaspoonful of salt 

2 ounces of grated fresh pine- A saltspoonful of celery seed 
apple 

Put the meat twice through a meat chopper; add the 
grated pineapple and stir constantly for five or ten min- 
utes; this should be done in an earthen or china vessel. 
Stand the bowl in a pan of hot water and stir until the 
thermometer registers 103 Fahr. Keep it at this tempera- 
ture for at least two hours, agitating every fifteen minutes. 
Add the salt and the celery seed, crushed, and press the 
contents through a fine sieve and heat to 200 Fahr. Chill 
quickly and keep in a cold place. To serve, put two table- 
spoonfuls of this mixture in a cup, and fill the cup with 
hot water. 

BEEF GRUEL 

Soak two tablespoonfuls of farina in one pint of beef 
tea in a cold place over night. Next morning bring to a 
boil, simmer gently thirty minutes, strain, season with salt, 
and it is ready to serve. 

BEEF AND OATS 

Three Servings 

Moisten one level tablespoonful of finely-ground oats 
(groats) with two tablespoonfuls of cold water, add one 
pint of freshly-made beef tea, stir and boil ten minutes, 
strain through two thicknesses of cheesecloth and stand 
aside to cool. 

DOUBLE SOUP 

Cover one pound of chopped beef with one pint of cold 
water, stir until the meat is reduced to pulp, add one table- 
spoonful of granulated tapioca and stand the mixture in 



MRS. RORER S DIET FOR THE SICK 193 

a cold place for one hour. Then bring slowly to a boil, 
stirring every now and then ; strain through cheesecloth. 
Reheat the soup and stir into it a half pound of freshly- 
ground raw beef; stir constantly until it reaches boiling 
point, add a few drops of lemon juice and strain through 
cheesecloth. In low fever cases one ounce of this soup is 
considered a feeding. 

CONSOMME 

Put through a meat chopper one pound of veal and one 
pound of beef. Sprinkle over the bottom of a soup kettle 
a teaspoonful of sugar; when this burns and the bottom 
of the kettle is quite brown, add two tablespoonfuls of 
chopped onion, shake for a moment, then add the meat and 
stir over a very hot fire until the meat is slightly browned. 
Cover the kettle and push it to the back of the fire to steep 
for a half hour; then add a quart of cold water, bring to a 
boil and skim. Simmer gently two hours, add a bay leaf, 
a level teaspoonful of salt, and, if you have it, a little celery ; 
simmer one hour longer, and strain. Beat the white of 
an g with two tablespoonfuls of cold water, add it to 
the consomme, boil five minutes and strain through two 
thicknesses of cheesecloth that has been wrung from 
cold water, and stand the soup aside to cool. When cold, 
remove every particle of fat. This should be a brilliant 
amber in color, and of an exceedingly good flavor. 

ITALIAN CONSOMME 

Chop fine two ounces of raw beef, two ounces of raw 
mutton, and the dark meat of one chicken ; take the meat 
from the chicken bones, cut it with a knife until it is fine, 
then crack the bones, put all these in a small granite or 
porcelain saucepan, add a quart of cold water, bring to a 
boil and skim ; simmer gently one and a half hours ; then 
add one clove, a bay leaf and a little celery or celery seed ; 
simmer a half hour longer, and strain ; when cold, remove 
the fat. 

13 



194 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

This soup may be served as a clear soup ; or for con- 
valescing patients add carefully-boiled rice, a few croutons, 
or a little well-cooked spaghetti. 

MUTTON BROTH 

Purchase a neck of mutton, wash it and cut it into 
small bits, put it in a granite saucepan with a quart and 
a pint of cold water and two tablespoonfuls of washed rice ; 
bring to boiling point and skim ; simmer gently for three 
hours and strain; when cold, remove the fat. 

MUTTON BROTH WITH ZWEIBACK 

Procure a neck of mutton, cut it into bits, put it in a 
kettle with two quarts of cold water ; bring to boiling point 
and skim ; add a half teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful 
of finely-chopped mint ; simmer carefully for two and a 
half hours ; then add one slice of zweiback, rolled ; simmer 
gently thirty minutes longer, strain, and it is ready for use. 

If one must use the soup as soon as it is made, remove 
the grease with blotting paper. 

MUTTON TEA 

Purchase a pound of lean mutton, from the leg, put it 
twice through the meat chopper, then put it in a porcelain 
or granite kettle, add a pint of cold water and a saltspoon- 
ful of celery seed ; stir rapidly a few minutes and soak in a 
cool place for two hours. Then heat quickly to 180 Fahr. 
Strain and press ; add the white of an egg slightly beaten, 
bring to boiling point and strain through two thicknesses 
of cheesecloth. When cold, remove every particle of fat. 

MUTTON AND OATMEAL BROTH 

Put a half pint of mutton broth in a saucepan and stir 
in a tablespoonful of rolled oats; cook in a double boiler 
for thirty minutes ; strain, add two tablespoonfuls of cream, 
and. a saltspoonful of salt. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 195 

MUTTON AND CORNMEAL BROTH 

Wash two tablespoonfuls of yellow cornmeal through 
several cold waters; at the last washing allow the corn- 
meal to settle to the bottom of the bowl and pour off the 
water. Add the cornmeal to a half pint of mutton broth, 
cook in a double boiler for thirty minutes, add a saltspoon- 
ful of salt, four tablespoonfuls of cream, and serve. 

This is exceedingly good for chronic constipation. 

VEAL BROTH I 

One small knuckle of veal, covered with a quart and 
a pint of cold water ; bring to boiling point and skim, then 
cover and simmer gently two hours. Strain and stand 
aside until perfectly cold. Remove the fat. Heat the 
desired quantity and season with salt. 

VEAL BROTH II 

A small knuckle of veal, about 2 tablespoonfuls of thick cream 

i l /2 pounds Y 2 teaspoonful of salt 

A quart and a pint of cold water A saltspoonful of celery seed 
A slice of bread, well toasted 

Crush the celery seed with the salt. Cover the knuckle 
with the cold water, bring to a boil and skim ; add the 
salt mixture and the bread, and simmer gently for two 
hours. This should now be reduced one half. Strain and 
stand aside to cool. When cold this will form a perfectly 
clear jelly. At serving time reheat the required amount, 
add the cream and serve. This is nutritious and palatable. 

VEAL BROTH WITH EGG 

Make the veal broth according to preceding recipe. At 
serving time reheat the required amount and pour it, while 
hot, into the beaten yolk of one egg and add a tablespoonful 
of cream. 

Where bread is allowed, serve with it pulled bread or 
toasted bread fingers. 



196 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

BRAN BROTH 

Wash a half cupful of good wheat bran through sev- 
eral waters, add it to one pint of veal broth, boil for twenty 
minutes, strain, add two tablespoonfuls of cream and a 
saltspoonful of salt. This makes two portions. 

Chicken or mutton broth may be substituted for veal 
broth. 

CHICKEN BROTH 

For this purchase a fowl weighing three and a 
half pounds, not too fat; singe, draw it carefully, without 
breaking the intestines. Remember the appetite of a sick 
person is very capricious, and the slightest disagreeable 
odor or flavor will not only spoil the appetite for chicken 
broth, but will spoil the appetite for other dishes. After 
the chicken is carefully drawn, wash it quickly and wipe it. 
Be careful the oil bag is removed, as it also gives a dis- 
agreeable flavor. Remove the legs from the body of the 
chicken, and with a cleaver or large knife begin at the bot- 
tom of the leg and chop it quickly all the way up, cracking 
the bones thoroughly. Slash the meat on both sides, and 
put it with the back in the bottom of the soup kettle ; add 
two quarts of cold water, bring to a boil and skim. Put the 
white meat the two breasts, with the wings on top, cover 
the kettle and continue simmering until the white meat is 
tender, then remove it and put it aside for soup a la Reine, 
chicken souffle, or German chicken puff. Put into the 
kettle with the dark meat one bay leaf, one clove, a salt- 
spoonful of crushed celery seed and a half teaspoonful of 
salt. Cover and simmer one hour longer, then strain and 
stand away to cool. Remove every particle of fat from the 
surface, and the broth is ready to use. This should make 
one quart, enough to last for two days. Keep covered in 
a cold place. 

This may be served as chicken broth, plain, or some 
of the broth may be used with the white meat for soup 
a la Reine, or for chicken soup with rice.

SOUPS MAIGRE 

VEGETABLE BROTH 

Chop sufficient carrot to make a half cupful, add two 
tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, two tablespoonfuls of 
chopped turnip and a half cupful of chopped celery. Put a 
teaspoonful of sugar in the bottom of a soup kettle ; when it 
browns, add the onion, shake it until the onion is thoroughly 
browned, then add all the other vegetables and a quart and 
a pint of cold water; add one tablespoonful of washed rice, 
one tablespoonful of pearled barley and two tablespoonfuls 
of peanut butter; cover the saucepan and simmer gently 
one and a half hours. Strain through a fine sieve, season 
with salt and stand aside to cool. 

This makes an exceedingly agreeable soup for persons 
suffering from uric acid conditions or rheumatism. 

Almost any vegetables in season may be used in place 
of those mentioned. 

TOMATO BROTH 

Two Servings 

Cut three solid tomatoes into bits, put them in a sauce- 
pan with a blade of mace, a pint of cold water, a half tea- 
spoonful of salt, and if admissible a dash of pepper. Cover 
the saucepan and stew gently twenty minutes; strain 
through a sieve, reheat, add two tablespoonfuls of cream 
to each feeding and serve at once with croutons. 

The French have a fashion of whipping the cream and 
putting it on top of the soup, which gives it a dainty 
appearance. 

DRIED BEAN SOUP 

Dried beans, peas and lentils have more than meat 
value. . These soups may be used for the rheumatic, gouty 
and uric acid patients in the place of meat at dinner. They 
are exceedingly good also for persons suffering from 
nervous breakdown. They give the necessary nitrogen, 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 201 

without the stimulating principles of beef. It is wise to 
cook enough beans one day to last for two or three days. 

Wash a cupful of dried beans, soak them in cold water 
over night ; next morning drain, cover with cold water, 
bring to boiling point, drain again and throw the water 
away. Return the beans to the saucepan, cover with one 
quart of cold water, cover the saucepan and cook slowly 
until the beans are perfectly tender, about one and a half 
to two hours. Press them through a sieve, using the water 
as well as the pulp ; reheat this pulp, and add a half tea- 
spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of lemon juice and a tea- 
spoonful of onion juice. Stand it at once in a cold place. 

At serving time reheat the desired quantity, add boil- 
ing water or milk to make it the proper consistency, and 
serve in a bouillon cup with toasted strips of white bread. 

BEAN FLOUR SOUP 
One Serving 

You can purchase from any druggist a bean flour, or 
rolled beans, which can be quickly made into soup. The 
best of these preparations are made by the Battle Creek 
Food Company. 

Moisten a teaspoonful of the flour in a little cold water, 
add a cupful of boiling water, and simmer half an hour, 
season, add a little butter or cream, and serve. 

Rolled beans may be made into a soup almost as 
quickly as the bean flour. 

DRIED PEA SOUP 

One Serving 

Proceed precisely the same as you would for dried 
bean soup, using either the split or green dried peas. The 
split peas, however, are best. 

LENTIL SOUP 

Substitute lentils for beans, and proceed precisely the 
same as for soup of dried beans. Lentils are more easy of 
digestion than either beans or peas. 



202 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Revalenta Arabica is the name given to red lentil flour 
sold in the markets of the United States. 

It contains more than meat value, and is quickly made 
into a soup the same as bean flour. All these soups are 
exceedingly good for nursing mothers. 

CELERY BROTH 

One Serving 

Take six or eight outside stalks of celery, pare the root 
and cut it into slices. Put a teaspoonful of sugar in the 
bottom of the saucepan, let it brown thoroughly, then add 
one pint of cold water and a half pint of finely-chopped 
celery, using a few of the green tops. Cover the saucepan, 
simmer gently for a half hour, then strain, pressing the 
celery. Reheat, add a palatable seasoning of salt, turn the 
broth into a bouillon cup, put a tablespoonful of whipped 
cream on top and serve. 

This is exceedingly good for nervous patients, and if 
well made is appetizing. 

OATMEAL BROTH 
One Serving 

Put a teaspoonful of sugar in the bottom of a saucepan, 
let it burn, add one tablespoonful of chopped onion, shake 
until the onion is quite brown, add a tablespoonful of olive 
oil and a half pint of water. Sprinkle into this as soon as 
it boils one tablespoonful of rolled oats, cover and simmer 
gently thirty minutes, add a half teaspoonful of celery salt 
and a dash of pepper; strain, serve in a cup with a table- 
spoonful of whipped cream on top. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 203 

MILK SOUPS 

These are known as cream soups in ordinary cooking 
nomenclature, and are usually made from some appetizing 
green vegetable and thickened milk. They are to be recom- 
mended because they are palatable, easily made and nutri- 
tious. 

CREAM OF ASPARAGUS 
One Serving 

Peel carefully four shoots of asparagus. Cut them 
into small pieces, put them in a saucepan with a half 
pint of cold water, cover, bring to boiling point and cook 
gently thirty minutes. Press the whole through a sieve ; 
the water will have almost evaporated. Return the pulp 
to the saucepan, add two-thirds of a cupful of milk with 
a teaspoonful of cornstarch moistened in it. Boil an instant, 
add a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of butter, strain 
again, and serve with tiny croutons. 

CREAM OF CELERY 

One Serving 

Chop sufficient green tops of celery to make a half 
cupful, and cut two stalks of celery; add to a pint of cold 
water, cover and simmer gently thirty minutes. Strain 
and squeeze from the celery all the liquid ; add a half cupful 
of good milk with a teaspoonful of cornstarch moistened 
in it; stir until boiling, add a saltspoonful of salt and a 
teaspoonful of butter. The food value may be increased by 
adding two tablespoonfuls of carefully-boiled rice. 

CRESCENT SOUP 
One Serving 

The heart of one head of celery Y* pint of water 

Yi teaspoonful of salt 4 tablespoonfuls of cream 

Yolk of one egg 

Cut the heart of the celery into thin slices crosswise, 
add the water and stew carefully for a half hour, then add 
the salt, take from the fire, add the cream and the yolk 
of an egg. Reheat over water and serve. 



204 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

CREAM OF CARROT 

One Serving 

Grate sufficient carrot to make two tablespoonfuls ; add 
half a cupful of chicken stock; cook thirty minutes, then add 
half a cupful of milk with a teaspoonful of cornstarch moist- 
ened in it ; when this reaches boiling point, add a level tea- 
spoonful of butter and a saltspoonful of salt. 

Good in cases of chronic constipation. Omit corn- 
starch for diabetic persons. 

CREAM OF CORN 
One Serving 

Score down the center of each row of grains on two 
perfect ears of corn; and, with a dull knife, press out all the 
pulp, leaving the hulls on the cob. Put two-thirds of a 
cupful of milk in a double boiler, add the corn, cover and 
cook fifteen minutes; then add a level teaspoonful of corn- 
starch moistened in four tablespoonfuls of cold milk ; stir 
until the thickness of cream, add a quarter of a teaspoonful 
of salt, take from the fire and stir in carefully a teaspoonful 
of butter or a tablespoonful of cream. 

A slice of onion may be cooked in the milk and re- 
moved before serving the soup. This soup is nutritious 
and palatable, and is an exceedingly good supper dish in 
cases of chronic constipation. 

VELVET SOUP 

One Serving 

Make a cream of corn soup according to the preced- 
ing recipe, and at serving time, instead of adding butter, 
stir in two tablespoonfuls of cream, whipped to a stiff froth. 

CREAM OF GREEN PEAS 

One Serving 

Press a half cupful of cooked green peas through a 
sieve ; put the pulp in a saucepan with two-thirds of a 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 205 

cupful of milk ; add a teaspoonful of cornstarch moistened 
in a little cold milk, and a saltspoonful of salt; bring to 
boiling point; take from the fire and stir in a teaspoonful 
of butter. Serve with tiny croutons. 

CREAM OF SPLIT PEAS 

Wash a half pint of split yellow peas ; soak them over 
night. Next morning drain, wash, cover with a quart of 
fresh cold water, bring to a boil, drain and throw this water 
away. Cover the peas again with a quart of freshly-boiled 
water, add a slice of onion, cover the kettle and cook slowly 
for about one and a half hours ; drain, and throw the water 
away. Press the peas through a sieve and stand them aside 
to use as wanted. At serving time, to make a single por- 
tion, put a cupful of milk in a double boiler, add a level 
teaspoonful of cornstarch moistened in a little cold milk, 
stir until the milk thickens, add three tablespoonfuls of the 
pulp of the peas, a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful 
of butter; when hot, serve. It should be as thick as good 
cream. 

Lentils and dried beans may be used in same way. 

This is exceedingly valuable food for children and is 
good for nursing mothers. It has meat value. 

CREAM OF POTATO 

One Serving 

Pare a medium-sized potato, cover with boiling water, 
boil five minutes, drain and cover again with a half pint of 
boiling water; add a bay leaf, a saltspoonful of celery 
seed; cover and cook until the potato is thoroughly done. 
Press the whole through a fine sieve ; the water will have 
nearly evaporated ; add tw'o-thirds of a cupful of milk, stir 
for a moment, reheat, add a level teaspoonful of cornstarch 
or arrowroot, moistened in a little cold milk ; bring to the 
boiling point; take from the fire, add a saltspoonful of 
salt and a teaspoonful of butter. Strain again through a 
very fine sieve, reheat over hot water and serve at once. 



206 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

SPINACH SOUP 
One Serving 

This soup is exceedingly good in cases of constipation. 
Wash carefully sufficient spinach leaves to make one pint. 
Put the spinach in a hot, dry kettle, add quickly a half 
cupful of water and a half teaspoonful of salt. Cover the 
kettle, cook over a moderate fire for twenty minutes, drain 
and chop the spinach very fine. Put a half pint of milk 
in a double boiler, add a teaspoonful of cornstarch, moist- 
ened, stir until smooth and creamlike, and add the spinach. 
When hot, press through a fine sieve, add a teaspoonful of 
butter; or serve it in a cup with a tablespoonful of whipped 
cream on top. 

Tender lettuce or cress may be substituted for spinach. 

CREAM OF TURNIP 

One Serving 

Grate one young turnip, about two tablespoonfuls ; add 
a half cupful of cold water, cook in a double boiler fifteen 
minutes, add a saltspoonful of salt, half a cupful of milk, 
and if admissible, a dash of pepper. When hot, add a level 
teaspoonful of cornstarch, moistened in a little cold milk; 
stir and cook for five minutes, add a teaspoonful of butter 
and serve. Omit cornstarch for diabetic persons. 

CREAM OF OYSTER 

One Serving 

Wash six fat oysters by pouring over them cold water ; 
throw them into a hot granite saucepan, shake quickly until 
the gills of the oysters curl, then drain, saving the liquor. 
Put a half cupful of milk into the saucepan, add the oyster 
liquor, and then the oysters; when scalding hot take from 
the fire, add a teaspoonful of butter, a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and if admissible, a crushed whole pepper- 
corn. This, however, may be added to the milk when it is 
first put over the fire, and strained out before adding the 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 207 

oysters ; the patient then gets the flavor of pepper without 
the irritating effect. 

Serve in a dainty bowl, with long crisp oyster crackers. 

BISQUE OF OYSTER 

Chop sufficient celery to make a half cupful ; cover it 
with a pint of cold water, stew for a half hour ; by this time 
the water will be reduced one-half; strain, pressing all the 
juice from the celery ; bring again to boiling point, add six 
oysters that have been drained and washed; stir until the 
mixture reaches the boiling point, then add six tablespoon- 
fuls of cream and serve. 

CREAM EGGS AND BEEF 
Three Servings 

Wash two tablespoonfuls of pearled sago until the 
water is clear; drain, cover it with a pint of cold milk and 
let it soak over night in a cold place, or for at least two 
hours. Put it in a double boiler and cook until the sago 
is clear, about a half hour. Take from the fire and add a 
pint of clarified beef tea, a half teaspoonful of salt, or celery 
salt if you have it. Return the mixture to the fire, and 
when scalding hot stir in the well-beaten yolks of two eggs ; 
take quickly from the fire and stand it aside to cool. At 
serving time heat the desired quantity over hot water, 
stirring constantly. Excellent for nursing mothers and 
invalids.

fully. Turn into a double boiler, add a pint of milk, cover 
the boiler and let the contents cook slowly for thirty min- 
utes ; add a half teaspoonful of salt and strain. Serve alone 
or with croutons, as the case requires. 



208 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

ANIMAL FOODS 

These are derived from the flesh of animals, and con- 
sist of meats and the internal organs of animals and fowls 
used as food sweetbreads, tripe, liver, kidneys, brains, 
tongues and "frys," and the roe, milts and sounds of fish, 
gelatin and isinglass ; poultry and game ; sea foods fish, 
shell fish, as oysters, clams, scallops ; the Crustacea lobsters,, 
crabs, prawns, shrimps and cray fish ; and reptiles, as green 
turtles and terrapin ; and eggs and milk. 

In feeding the sick, the most important of these, per- 
haps, are eggs and milk. 

MEATS 

In this group we include the flesh of animals used as 
food beef, veal, mutton, lamb, poultry, game and rabbit. 

All meats are highly nitrogenous, and most of them are 
easy of digestion and assimilation, because they contain the 
same chemical elements as our own bodies. 

The digestibility, however, is largely governed by the 
method of cooking. For instance, a broiled steak is more 
easily digested than a fried steak. The outside cut of baked 
meat is not as easily digested as a center cut. 

Raw beef and mutton, scraped, are more easily digested 
than cooked meat, but cooking is necessary to destroy the 
parasitic, living organisms that may be accidentally present 
in it. Cooking also develops the flavor and appearance of 
meat, and makes it more palatable. 

Mature, well-killed and "hung" lean beef and mutton 
are more easily digested than the flesh of young animals, as 
veal and lamb. 

The flesh of veal and rabbit is especially dense, and quite 
unfit for food for the sick, although veal and rabbit broth 
are frequently recommended in certain cases of chronic gas- 
tritis. 

Meats for the sick must be perfectly fresh and carefully 
selected. Lean meat from a fat animal is more tender than 
lean meat from a lean animal. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 209 

Next to the mammals, barnyard poultry is the most 
important from a dietary standpoint, excepting birds and 
deer. The flesh of these wild animals is generally quite free 
from fat, which makes them more easy of digestion and 
better adapted for diet for the sick. 

Next in order comes the white-fleshed fish an impor- 
tant article of nourishment, providing they are perfectly 
fresh. There is nothing more dangerous, however, than 
stale sea food. The flesh of salmon and sturgeon approaches 
the composition of lean beef more nearly than the flesh of 
white fish. Mackerel, eels, catfish, herring and shad are all 
characterized by the presence of fatty matter mingled 
throughout the flesh, which makes them more difficult of 
digestion. 

Of the white-fleshed fish, the ordinary white fish of the 
lakes, cod, rock bass, halibut, haddock, sole and flounder 
are to be preferred. 

Shell fish differ widely in digestibility. The oyster has 
a decided advantage over the clam and scallop. Oysters 
have a place in diet for the sick ; the clam itself has not, but 
clam bouillon is highly recommended in many diseases. The 
oyster is no doubt a nutritious, easily digested food ; opin- 
ions differ, however, regarding this fact. They are more 
easily digested raw than cooked, but, like meat, they should 
be cooked to remove the danger of micro-organisms that 
may be present. Unless one knows that their oysters have 
been fattened in perfectly clean water, they had better eat 
them thoroughly cooked. 

THE CRUSTACEA 

The Crustacea are regarded in this country as choice and 
attractive foods, but the flesh is dense, firm and unfit for 
diet for the sick; in fact, they frequently cause digestive 
troubles in persons who are quite well, and if not perfectly 
fresh are dangerous.

210 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

FISH 

From a dietetic standpoint, fish is classed with the flesh 
of animals a nitrogenous food. The protein in white fish, 
as cod, haddock and halibut, is in about the same proportion 
as in beef and mutton. The ratio of water in fish, flesh and 
fowl is quite uniform; fish contains, however, more phos- 
phorus, and the active fish, as trout and pickerel, contain a 
greater percentage. The amount of fat in fish is much 
smaller than in the flesh of animals. In the white-fleshed 
fish it is largely secreted in the liver, which makes the flesh 
more easy of digestion a better food for the sick than the 
pink or dark-fleshed fish, in which the fat is distributed or 
mingled throughout the flesh. 

The flesh of the male or milt fish is generally considered 
superior in flavor to that of the roe or female fish. At the 
period of the ripening of the roe and milt, fish are said to be 
in season, because the flesh at that time possesses the high- 
est degree of flavor. 

All fish should be eaten soon after they are taken from 
the w'ater. Stale fish is not only unpleasant, but dangerous. 

In cases of prolonged feeding, where nitrogenous foods 
are allowable or called for, a piece of white-fleshed fish, 
broiled or boiled, gives variety. 

If small fish, like smelts or trout, are to be used as diet 
for the sick, they must be broiled or boiled, never fried. 
Planking, which is broiling on a plank, may be used in the 
place of broiling ; it gives an appetizing and sightly dish. 

To Purchase Fish Examine the flesh, which should be 
firm ; the scales should be closely adhering and of brilliant 
color, the eyes and gills bright, and the flesh free from any 
unpleasant odor. 

TO BOIL FISH 

Cut a thick piece from the center of a fine white-fleshed 
fish, wash it quickly in cold water, wipe it carefully and 
dust it with salt. Wrap it in a piece of cheesecloth, put 
it in a kettle of boiling water, add a slice of onion, a bay 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 211 

leaf and a half teaspoonful of salt. Cover and push the 
saucepan to the back of the stove, to simmer, for fifteen min- 
utes. Lift the cheesecloth, drain, turn the fish on a small 
serving platter and garnish it with crisp parsley and a quar- 
ter of a lemon. Serve with cream sauce, sauce Hollandaise, 
or just a little melted butter and lemon juice. 

BROILED FISH 

Purchase a center steak from any white-fleshed fish, 
cut off enough for one feeding and give the rest to the fam- 
ily; fish must not be used the second day. Wash it 
quickly, wipe it dry, put it in a wire broiler and over a clear 
fire until slightly browned on one side, turn and brown 
the other ; then hold it at least six inches above the fire ; turn 
it once or twice, broiling it in all ten minutes. Transfer 
it to a heated platter, spread over with a little butter, put 
over a few drops of lemon juice and serve at once. 

PLANKED FISH 

Secure for individual service a small oblong plank, 
not over four inches in width and six inches long. 

Boil a good-sized potato; when done mash it thor- 
oughly, add four tablespoonfuls of milk and a palatable 
seasoning of salt, and beat it until light and white. Put a 
small star tube in the end of a pastry bag, and turn in the 
mashed potato. Select a slice of fish sufficiently large for 
the patient, wash it in cold water, dry with a soft cloth and 
dust it with salt. Put the plank in the oven until very 
hot; if you have a gas stove put it underneath the gas 
burners, down as near the floor of the stove as possible; 
when hot, put on the fish, skin side down, dust it with salt, 
return it to the oven and cook quickly for twenty minutes ; 
by this time the fish should be brown. Take the plank 
from the oven, press the potatoes through the star tube 
around the edge of the plank, put the plank back until the 
potatoes are a golden brown ; garnish it with parsley and 
lemon, and serve at once. This makes a very sightly and 
palatable dish. 



212 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

FISH IN A PAPER BAG 

Select the necessary piece of fish, dust it lightly with 
salt, put it in an oiled paper bag, fold over the end of the 
bag, fasten it, lay it on a grate in a baking pan, and bake 
in a quick oven fifteen minutes. Transfer the fish to a 
heated plate, garnish with potato roses, or serve with it 
plain boiled potatoes. 

This is one of the nicest ways of cooking fish. 

OYSTER BOUILLON I 

Purchase twelve salt oysters in the shell ; wash and 
scrub the shells thoroughly ; put them into a saucepan with 
a pint of boiling water, cover and bring quickly to a boil. 
Lift one oyster at a time and puncture the flesh in several 
places with a silver fork, put it back in the saucepan, 
cook for ten minutes and strain through two thicknesses 
of cheesecloth. 

OYSTER BOUILLON II 

Drain, and wash, by pouring over them cold water, 
twelve large oysters; throw them into a dry, hot granite 
kettle and shake over the fire until the gills are thorougly 
curled and the liquor boiling. Pick the oysters with a 
silver fork, strain the bouillon through cheesecloth, press- 
ing lightly; reheat and serve. Season with salt only. 

DRY PANNED OYSTERS 

Wash the desired quantity of oysters by pouring over 
them, in a sieve, a quart of cold water. Put a granite pan 
over the fire; when very hot throw in the oysters, shake 
quickly and cook until the gills are curled, add a palatable 
seasoning of salt and a teaspoonful of butter or two table- 
spoonfuls of cream. Transfer to a heated dish and serve at 
once. 

PLAIN BROILED OYSTERS 

Select four large, fat oysters, put them on a board, dry 
on both sides with a piece of soft cheesecloth, dust lightly 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 313 

with salt, dip in fine, dry bread crumbs. Put the oysters in 
the center of a wire broiler, hold over a clear fire or under- 
neath the oven burners of a gas stove, until they are 
browned on one side; turn and brown the other. Transfer 
them to a small heated platter, put a bit of butter and a few 
drops of lemon juice on each, and serve at once. 

GRIDDLED OYSTERS 

Place an ordinary cake griddle over the fire; when hot 
rub quickly with a tiny bit of suet. Dry four or six good 
fat oysters with a piece of cheesecloth, throw them on the 
hot griddle; when brown on one side turn, with a cake 
turner, and brown the other. Serve on buttered toast. 

These are frequently served in the oyster liquor. Boil 
the liquor and skim it, add a teaspoonful of butter or a 
tablespoonful of cream, add a half saltspoonful of salt, 
throw the hot broiled oysters into this, and serve with toast. 

BOILED OYSTERS 

Select four or six medium-sixed oysters, drain them, 
throw them in a kettle of boiling water, boil two minutes, 
drain again and stand aside to cool. When cold, dish on 
crisp lettuce leaves, baste with French dressing and serve. 

CLAM BOUILLON 

If clam broth is to be used for any length of time, it 
is wise to buy fifty medium-sized hard shell clams ; put 
them in a cold place and sprinkle them every day with 
cold salt water. 

To Make an Individual Portion Wash and scrub six 
clams ; put them in a small kettle or saucepan with a half 
pint of cold water, cover the kettle, bring it quickly to a boil. 
Lift the lid and you will find that the clams have opened. 
Take out one at a time, puncture it in several places with a 
silver fork, drop it back into the kettle, cover and cook for 
a few minutes longer. Take out the clams and strain the 



214 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

broth through two thicknesses of cheesecloth, and it is ready 
to serve. 

To Allay Pernicious Vomiting Two tablespoonfuls fed 
to the patient by teaspoonfuls, will be quite sufficient for 
one feeding. This may be repeated every thirty minutes if 
necessary. 

CLAM BROTH 

Make precisely the same as clam bouillon, using a table- 
spoonful of cream to each half cupful (one gill) of broth. 

CLAM BROTH WITH WHIPPED CREAM 

Heat four tablespoonfuls of clam bouillon in a tiny 
saucepan, add a little celery salt, turn into a heated cup, 
put on top a tablespoonful of whipped cream and serve 
at once. 

BELLEVUE BOUILLON 

Heat four tablespoonfuls of clam bouillon and four 
tablespoonfuls of chicken broth, mix and pour into a bouillon 
cup, put a tablespoonful of whipped cream on top and serve.

MEATS 

BEEF 

Beef should be fine grained; that portion exposed to 
the air a light red, showing a shade of purple when the first 
slice is cut off. For the sick, purchase the best quality of 
lean beef; be sure the fat is solid and whitish, not yellow. 

For broiling, the tenderloin or sirloin is best. 

For beef tea, the sticking piece is first choice; second, 
the round or rump. 

For Hamburg steaks or dishes made from chopped 
meat, purchase the round. 

The choice methods of cooking beef for the sick are 
broiling, boiling, roasting or baking. If tender meat is not 
accessible, purchase the round and put it twice through the 
meat chopper, form it into cakes and broil them. If there 
are no conveniences for broiling, cook them in a dry pan, 
without fat, turning them almost constantly while cooking. 

TO BROIL A STEAK 

Cut off just sufficient for the meal ; if tenderloin, a slice 
from the entire tenderloin; if sirloin, cut near the middle 
a piece sufficiently large for a serving. Trim off every 
particle of suet. 

If you are to broil it over a coal fire, see that the coals 
are bright and red, and free from gas. Put the steak in a 
wire broiler, and near the fire, sear quickly on one side, turn 
and sear the other; turn it each twenty seconds, for three 
minutes ; then lift the steak about six inches from the fire 
and broil it slowly on one side for three minutes, then turn 
it and cook it three minutes longer; this is allowing for a 
steak an inch and a half in thickness. Transfer it at once 
to a small heated platter, dust it lightly with salt, spread it 
with a little butter and serve at once. 

If the steak is one inch thick, it will require eight min- 
utes for broiling; if one and a half inches thick, ten min- 
utes; two inches, fifteen minutes. It should be rare, but 



216 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

not raw. Be very careful that it is sufficiently cooked to 
remove the "purple" coloring from the center of the steak. 
Charcoal broiling is the same. 

TO PAN BROIL A STEAK 

Cut the steak one inch thick. Put an iron shallow 
frying pan over the fire ; when very hot throw in the steak ; 
it will fasten itself to the pan immediately. Loosen it with 
a cake turner and turn it as you would a griddle cake. As 
soon as it sears on this side, turn it again, and keep turning 
it every half minute for five minutes. Transfer it to a 
small heated platter, dust it with salt, spread over a little 
butter and serve it at once. 

This is by no means an inferior way of cooking a steak, 
providing you stand over it during the entire cooking. 

TO BROIL ON A GAS STOVE 

Light the oven burners three minutes before placing 
the steak; have everything else for the meal ready. See 
that the broiling pan and rack underneath the gas burners 
are in their proper places. Have the steak cut one inch 
thick. When the broiler is hot draw it out, place the steak 
in the middle, put it as near the gas flame as possible 
without touching it. As soon as the steak is seared on 
this side, draw out the pan, and with a fork (sticking it 
as near the edge of the steak as possible) turn, and sear 
the other side. Turn the steak again, lower the pan about 
six or seven inches, turn the burners half way down and 
broil slowly three minutes on one side, turn and broil three 
minutes on the other. Season and serve. 

BEEF COOKED IN TOMATO 

In certain cases of obesity where tomatoes are allow- 
able, this gives variety and is exceedingly palatable. 

Chop fine or grind a quarter of a pound of round of 
beef, season it with a half teaspoonful of salt, and a dash 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 217" 

of pepper, if admissible. Cut the stem end from a large 
solid tomato, scoop out the seeds and core, leaving the skin 
with a comfortably thick wall. Put the meat lightly into 
the tomato, and bake it in the oven fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Transfer it to a heated plate, put a little butter 
in the center and send it at once to the table. The meat 
should be smoking hot to the very bottom, a little rare, and 
the tomato soft. 

BEEFSTEAK IN A PAPER BAG 

Purchase a slice of tenderloin not over three-quarters 
of an inch thick. Open a small paper bag and grease it 
slightly with olive oil. Dust the steak lightly with salt, 
put it in the bag, fold over the ends and fasten them; put 
it on a small grate in a pan, and in a quick oven for twenty 
minutes. Open the bag and put the steak, with all the juice, 
on a small heated plate, and serve at once. 

Meat cooked in a paper bag is very much better than 
when pan broiled. 

SALISBURY STEAK 

Put a half pound of the round of beef twice through 
the meat chopper; add a half teaspoonful of salt and form 
it into a round cake, making it of equal thickness through- 
out that is, have the sides as thick as the center. Put this 
into a perfectly dry, hot iron pan ; turn it with a cake turner 
several times, cooking it at least ten minutes. Dish it on 
a heated plate, squeeze over a little lemon juice and serve 
at once. If, for any reason, the meat is needed very well 
done, make the half pound into two cakes. The stringy por- 
tion, about one-half the weight of the meat, should be held 
in the chopper. A little butter over the cooked steaks is 
frequently admissible. The salt should be added to the 
meat, use no pepper. 



218 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

THE RORER MEAT CAKE 

Purchase a half pound of tenderloin of beef; take a 
blunt silver knife and scrape the pulp of the meat from the 
fibre; put that which you have scraped on to a porcelain, 
or ordinary china plate ; it must not touch iron or tin. When 
you have sufficient scraped, make it into two small cakes, 
about a half inch thick. Put these in a paper bag or in a piece 
of oiled paper and cook on a rack in a pan in a very hot 
oven ten minutes ; when done, place them on a heated dish, 
dust lightly with salt, put in the center of each a tiny bit 
of butter and serve immediately. 

ALMOND MEAT CAKE 

Add to the Rorer meat cake six almonds that have 
been blanched and ground ; after the cakes are dished on 
the heated plate add a few drops of lemon juice with the 
butter. 

PANNED CHOPPED MEAT 

Put a quarter of a pound of tenderloin through a meat 
chopper. Put it in a hot porcelain saucepan, add four table- 
spoonfuls of water, cover the pan, bring it quickly to a boil, 
add a saltspoonful of salt, a level teaspoonful of butter, 
stir and serve quickly in a tiny, heated vegetable dish. 
Excellent when well made. 

HOMEMADE PEMMICAN 

% pound of lean beef put twice 54 pound of marrow from the leg 
through a meat chopper or shin bone of an ox 

Chop the marrow with a silver knife and remove the 
fibre. Mix the beef and marrow thoroughly, a half salt- 
spoonful of salt and stand at once in a cold place. 

In cases of pernicious anaemia, induce the patient, if 
possible, to eat this whole amount in two or three feedings. 

Serve with it whole wheat bread or some easily- 
digested, simply-cooked green vegetable, or a sliced orange, 
or a few white grapes, or make it into sandwiches. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 219 

TO "ROAST" OR BAKE BEEF 

Select two good standing ribs, the first or second cut, 
according to the size of the family ; the first cut will make 
a small compact roast. Have the ribs trimmed and cracked. 
Put the 1 roast in the pan, rib side down, put a teaspoonful 
of salt in the pan, and a half cupful of water ; place at once 
in a very hot oven and bake until the outside of the meat 
is thoroughly seared, about twenty-five minutes. Cool the 
oven, and begin to baste the meat with the fat that is now 
dripping in the pan, and roast a large joint fifteen minutes 
to each pound. A small two-rib roast w'eighing six pounds 
will bake in an hour and a quarter. Do not add any more 
water to the pan ; baste with the fat that is dripping from 
the meat. 

This recipe will answer for mutton and lamb. 

BOILED BEEF 

Purchase the bolar piece the fleshy part of the shoul- 
der or a piece from the upper round. Select a kettle that 
will hold sufficient water to entirely cover the piece of 
meat to be boiled. When the water is boiling, put in the 
meat, boil rapidly five minutes, then push the kettle to the 
back of the stove and keep at a temperature of 170 Fahr., 
and cook fifteen minutes to each pound of meat. When 
the meat is partly done, add salt, either plain or celery 
salt, a bay leaf and a clove to the water. The water 
in which this meat is boiled may be saved for ordinary 
soup. If the meat has been carefully cooked the water 
will contain but very little nourishment. 

Carefully-boiled meat will be juicy, slightly rare and 
perfectly tender. 

Boiled meat is considered more digestible than baked 
or roasted meats. 



220 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

THE SECOND COOKING OF MEATS 

Even to a healthy person who has good digestion, the 
ordinary hash is an abomination. There are only a very 
few ways in which meat can be warmed over for the sick. 
Boudins or dishes where the meat is heated in the oven 
in hot water are preferable. Croquettes contain nutritious 
material, but the combination and frying renders them unfit 
for the sick. Avoid all warmed-over dishes, like hash, 
ragouts, or brown stews. 

BOUDINS 

Chop a quarter of a pound of tender, rare roasted beef. 
For the sick, I think it is wise to put this twice through 
a meat chopper. Put four tablespoonfuls of water and a 
tablespoonful of dry bread crumbs in a saucepan, cook a 
moment, and add the meat. Take from the fire, drop in 
the yolk of an egg, a saltspoonful of salt, and then fold 
in the well-beaten white of the egg. Turn this into a little 
boudin mold or custard cup, stand it in a pan of boiling 
water and cook over the fire or in the oven for fifteen min- 
utes. Serve at once. 

This is very nutritious and easily digested. An excel- 
lent dish for the aged. 

BEEF PUDDING 

Line an individual dish or a ramekin with a thin layer 
of mashed potatoes ; put in the center about four table- 
spoonfuls of nicely-seasoned cold roasted beef, chopped 
fine. Cover the top with more mashed potatoes, stand the 
dish in a pie plate of hot water and bake in the oven until 
a golden brown, about twenty minutes. 

TURKISH BEEF 

Chop a quarter of a pound of roasted beef very fine, 
season it with a saltspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of 
pounded celery seed ; put this into a ramekin or a small 
individual baking dish, pour over four tablespoonfuls of 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 221 

leban ; stand the dish in a pan of hot water and cook in the 
oven fifteen minutes, and serve. 

This is excellent in cases of indigestion. The leban 
renders the beef more digestible and gives a greater food 
value. Matzoon or zoolak may be used in the place of leban. 

SALT MEATS 

Salt meats take no part whatever in diet for the sick; 
we simply mention them to condemn them. 

Broiled bacon is the exception. It is more digestible 
and nutritious than fresh fat pork, and may now and then 
be used sparingly. In salt lean meats the fibre is rendered 
hard and difficult of digestion. The meat is deficient in 
natural mineral matter, and contains an excess of chloride 
of sodium. Persons who are perfectly well, after a meal of 
salt meat have an uncontrollable desire for water, which 
comes from an overheated, irritated condition of the stom- 
ach ; it is not true thirst, and must be looked on as an 
unnatural rather than a natural condition. 

TRIPE 

Tripe, being a portion of the digestive viscera of the ox, 
is one of the most easily-digested of animal foods, requiring 
only one hour for perfect digestion. It is generally cleaned 
by the butcher. When it comes home, wash it through 
several cold waters, put it in a kettle of boiling water and 
simmer gently eight hours or until it is perfectly tender. 
Take it out, stand it aside to cool, and it is ready to dress in 
many ways. It may be heated in a little cream sauce, or 
broiled, or stewed. If carefully prepared, it is a good food 
for the aged, for children over six years old, for the obese as 
well as the very thin, and for convalescing patients who are 
allowed solid foods. 

STEWED TRIPE 

Cut sufficient cold boiled tripe into narrow strips. Put 
a half pint of milk in a double boiler, add the tripe, add a 



222 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

half teaspoonful of cornstarch moistened in a little cold 
milk, a saltspoonful of salt and two drops of onion juice. 
Stir constantly until it thickens, take from the fire, add a 

teaspoonful of butter and serve on toast. 

/ 

BROILED TRIPE 

Cut the necessary sized piece from cold boiled tripe, 
dust it with salt, put it in a broiler and broil on both sides 
until slightly brown. Transfer it to a heated dish, put 
over a little butter and lemon juice, and serve. 

TRIPE AND OYSTERS 

Throw six oysters into a heated granite saucepan, shake 
until the gills are turned, then drain the oysters, saving 
the liquor. Beard the oysters, put the soft portion back 
in the liquor, add two tablespoonfuls of finely-chopped, 
well-cooked tripe, a crushed whole peppercorn and a salt- 
spoonful of salt ; bring to a boil, add two tablespoonfuls of 
cream and serve on toast. Or omit the pepper and add a 
half drop of Tabasco, or strain the pepper out before adding 
the oysters. 

MUTTON 

The flesh of good mutton should be a bright red color, 
the fat firm and white. The fatter the mutton, the better 
and more tender the lean parts, but as the fat of mutton 
is very rich in stearic acid, it is necessary that every 
particle be trimmed from the lean meat before it is cooked. 
The lean flesh of mutton is more loosely held together than 
that of beef, which makes it slightly more digestible. 

Purchase the shoulder for mutton tea, the neck for 
mutton broth, Frenched rib chops for broiling, and a leg 
for boiling. 

BROILED CHOPS 

Select one or two nicely-trimmed Frenched chops. Put 
the serving plate and a plate from which they are to be 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 223 

eaten to heat; mutton must be served on hot plates. 
Arrange the chops on a wire broiler, broil them quickly, 
searing first one side, then the other, and turning them 
every half minute for five minutes. Dish the chops, dust 
them lightly with salt, slip a quill of paper over the bones 
and serve at once. 

For convalescing patients, or for the aged or for chil- 
dren, the plate may be garnished with boUed rice, a table- 
spoonful of puree of peas, or potato roses. 

CHOPS IN A PAPER BAG 

This is the very nicest way of cooking chops. Season 
the chops with a little salt, rub each with a little butter, 
slip them into a paper bag, fasten the bag, put it on a wire 
rack in a pan, and cook them in a hot oven fifteen minutes. 
Open the bag, slip out the chops, and pour the juices from 
the bag over them ; put little quills of paper over the bones 
and serve at once. 

MUTTON CAKES 

Cut the lean portion from two Frenched chops, season 
it with a little salt, put them in a paper bag and cook them 
as you would ordinary chops. 

MUTTON PATS 

Purchase two slices of lean mutton from the leg. With 
a silver knife scrape first one side, then the other; as fast 
as meat pulp accumulates on the knife put it on a china 
or porcelain saucer. When you have scraped both pieces 
free from pulp, form it into little pats, making three or four, 
each one holding not more than three tablespoonfuls. Drop 
them into a hot, dry pan, cook a minute, turn with a cake 
turner, dish on a heated plate, dust lightly with salt, put 
over a little butter and serve at once. 

These may also be cooked in a paper bag. 



224 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

MUTTON CAKE WITH MUSHROOMS 

This dish will give variety to a diet in obesity. Take 
the lean portions from two Frenched chops, season with 
salt and a little pepper, put them in a paper bag, put on 
top of each a single mushroom, fasten the bag and cook 
in a quick oven fifteen minutes. When done, slip the chops 
and mushrooms on a heated plate, pour over the sauce, 
and add a few drops of lemon juice. Do not add butter. 

KLOPPS 

Chop four ounces of cold boiled mutton rather fine, 
add to it a saltspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of dry 
bread crumbs and the unbeaten white of one egg; mix 
thoroughly, and add a tablespoonful of finely-chopped 
mint. Form into balls the size of English walnuts, drop 
these balls into a saucepan of boiling stock, either beef or 
mutton ; draw the pan to one side of the fire where it can- 
not possibly boil again, until the balls come to the surface ; 
this will take about five minutes. Take them out with a 
skimmer, dish them neatly on a tiny hot platter. 

For the aged one may use a tablespoonful of cream 
sauce or sauce Hollandaise; for the obese, two or three 
tablespoonfuls of reduced tomato or horseradish sauce. 

MUTTON CASSEROLE 

Wash and boil six tablespoonfuls of rice; when this is 
dry put it into an ordinary custard cup, pressing it to the 
sides and bottom, leaving a well in the center. Cut suffi- 
cient cold cooked mutton into dice to fill the well, season 
with a little salt, put over two tablespoonfuls of cream, 
cover with a thin layer of rice, stand the cup in a baking 
pan of water, cover with greased paper and bake in a 
moderate oven twenty minutes. While this is baking, rub 
together a teaspoonful of butter and one of flour, add a 
half cupful of milk, boil, add a half saltspoonful of salt. 
Turn the casserole out on the serving dish, pour around 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 225 

the cream, sauce, add a little chopped parsley, and serve. 
This is a dainty, easily-digested dish ; nice for tubercu- 
losis patients, or children, or for the aged. 

VEAL 

Veal is an unfit food for the sick, because the flesh 
is dense and difficult of digestion the juices are rich in 
albumin, which hardens under the influence of heat. In 
gastric troubles, however, veal broth is to be recommended. 
In purchasing veal, see that it is not too young, the flesh 
is pink and the bones hard. Avoid veal where the flesh 
has a bluish tinge and is soft and flabby. 

The knuckle, which is the lower part of the leg after 
the cutlets are taken off, and the neck are the best pieces 
for soup and broth. 

The sweetbreads are a part of the digestive viscera 
of the calf, hence are easily digested ; when simply cooker 
and not covered with rich sauces or mixed with mush- 
rooms, they require only one hour for perfect digestion. 
They are rich in protein, but not as stimulating as lean 
flesh. They are sold in the market in pairs ; the short, 
chubby one is called by the butchers the "heart" sweet- 
bread; the long one, the thymus gland, is called by the 
butchers the "throat" sweetbread ; this is not as tender as 
the "heart" sweetbread. The thymus gland, however, is 
just as good for creamed sweetbreads, so in purchasing 
a pair, save the "heart" sweetbread, the pancreas, for broil- 
ing or baking, and the thymus gland for picking apart. 
They hold digestive secretions, which naturally causes them 
to spoil quickly ; in fact, they will digest themselves unless 
they are cooked or chilled as soon as they are taken from 
the calf. 

To prepare, put them first into cold water, wash them, 
cover them with boiling water, add a half teaspoonful of 
salt and simmer gently three-quarters of an hour; then put 
them in a cloth or bag and on the ice. They will keep for one 

is 



226 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

or two days. They are now ready for dressing or reheating 
according to the following recipes: 

BROILED SWEETBREADS 

Split a prepared "heart" sweetbread into three slices, put 
it on a broiler over a clear fire, browning first one side, then 
the other. Serye it at once with a little butter and salt. 
For a convalescing patient, serve with it a spoonful of 
green peas, or it may be served on a piece of crisp toast. 

BAKED SWEETBREADS 

Remove the membrane from the outside of a prepared 
'"heart" sweetbread, brush it with melted butter, dust it with 
salt, wrap it in a piece of oiled letter paper or put it in a paper 
bag, and bake in a moderately quick oven thirty minutes. 
Transfer it to a small heated dish, and pour over it the 
sauce from the bag. 

This may be served to an invalid with very young, 
tiny, fresh peas, or two or three tablespoonfuls of puree of 
green peas. 

TO CREAM SWEETBREADS 

Pick apart one prepared sweetbread, rejecting all the 
membrane. One gland will make two meals. Moisten two 
level teaspoonfuls of flour in a little cold milk, add a half 
cupful of hot milk, and when boiling add half a sweetbread. 
Stand the saucepan in another of hot water, cover and cook 
slowly for twenty minutes. Take from the fire, add a 
quarter of a teaspoonful of celery salt and a teaspoonful of 
butter. Serve on toast or in a border of carefully-boiled 
rice. 

SWEETBREADS IN JELLY 

Boil a pair of sweetbreads as directed; put them aside 
to cool. When cool, pick the sweetbreads apart, rejecting 
all the membrane. Cover a half box of gelatin with a half 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 227 

cupful of cold water, let it soak for a half hour, then add 
one cupful of boiling stock, a half teaspoonful, of beef ex- 
tract, a half teaspoonful of celery salt and ten drops of onion 
juice ; strain, and add a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Put the 
sweetbreads in a round or square mold, pour over the liquid 
jelly, just enough to cover, and stand aside in a cold place. 
This may be served with fresh celery or cress, or tender 
lettuce salad. A nice dish for the obese. 

LIVER 

The liver, heart and kidneys of both veal, mutton, lamb 
and beef are unfit food for the sick. 



228 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

POULTRY AND GAME 

Poultry for the well and the sick should be in perfectly 
fresh condition, not cold storage. Chickens and turkeys 
should be dry picked, not scalded ; this is especially impor- 
tant for young chickens, as they are so small that dipping 
them in a bucket of hot water blanches and partly cooks 
the flesh next to the skin, which causes them to spoil 
quickly, and destroys the flavor. 

TO SELECT CHICKENS 

For Broiling Purchase a young chicken with firm flesh,, 
yellow skin and legs, and with a soft point to the breastbone. 
It should not weigh over one and a half pounds. 

A Squab Chicken is simply a young chicken not weigh- 
ing over one pound. 

For Boiling, Baking, Stewing and Soup Making Pur- 
chase a chicken at least one year old. The breastbone will 
be a little hard at the end, but easily broken ; if it is pointed 
and resists pressure, it is a fowl, not a chicken. 

TO DRAW A CHICKEN 

Draw the chickens as soon as they come from the mar- 
ket, and put them at once in a cold place. Cut off the feet 
and head, split the skin down the back of the neck, detach 
it from the neck, draw it down over the breast, take out the 
crop without breaking it, and cut the neck off close to the 
body. Turn the chicken over, make a vent under the rump 
large enough to easily draw out the intestines ; put in your 
finger and loosen the internal organs liver, heart, gizzard, 
lungs and entrails; grasp the gizzard and pull carefully, 
bringing them all out together, unbroken. With a sharp 
knife cut around the vent of the large intestine, and your 
chicken is clean. Be very careful not to break the gall bag 
or intestines, as the contents of either would render the 
fowl uneatable to the sick. The contents of the intestines 
are offensive, and no amount of soaking or washing will 
remove the odor and flavor from the meat. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 229 

Do not soak chickens in water. I cannot speak too 
strongly against this abominable practice. As soon as the 
chicken is carefully drawn, get a pan of cold water and a 
piece of cheesecloth, wash the skin thoroughly, wring out 
the cloth and wipe the chicken inside and out; put it on a 
dry plate and stand in a cold place. The soaking of meats 
in cold water draws out the nourishment and flavor. 

Do not use the giblets for the sick. 

These directions for drawing will answer for turkeys, 
chickens, ducks and all kinds of birds. 

TO BROIL A CHICKEN 

Select a very young chicken, draw it carefully; wash 
quickly and wipe it dry; put it in a broiler and then over 
a clear fire, bone side down ; broil slowly for fifteen min- 
utes, then turn it and broil on the other side for ten 
minutes. If you use a gas stove, put it under the gas jets 
bone side up, then turn it and broil on the other side. As 
soon as it is done, dish it on a heated plate ; spread it 
lightly with very sweet butter and use at once. 

The half of a "squab" chicken will be quite enough for 
a single feeding. 

TO BROIL BIRDS 

Split the birds down the back, remove the intestines ; 
with a damp cloth wash and wipe the birds quickly, sprinkle 
the bone side with salt, brush the skin with a little melted 
butter, and broil precisely the same as you would broil a 
chicken. Serve plain on a heated platter, or serve on a slice 
of nicely-toasted bread. 

TO BROIL CHICKEN IN AN OVEN 

Conveniences for broiling are sometimes lacking even 
in well-regulated households. One can always broil over 
coal or wood, but in the summer where oil or gasoline is 
used it is necessary to "oven broil." Wash the grate in the 



230 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

oven. Light the oven burners and see that the oven is very 
hot before putting- in the chicken or birds. Sprinkle the 
bone side with salt, brush the skin side with butter and 
dust it lightly with dry bread crumbs. Put them on the 
rack, bone side down, put a pan underneath, close the door 
and cook for a half to three-quarters of an hour; if care- 
fully done the chicken will be juicy and tender. 

This is not an inferior way of cooking a chicken, pro- 
vided the oven is hot at first. 

TO COOK CHICKEN IN A PAPER BAG 

This perhaps is one of the best ways of cooking chicken 
for the sick. There are very good, logical, scientific reasons 
for using a bag or oiled paper for oven cooking of meats. 

This method of cooking retains all the nutritious quali- 
ties, and the meat does not shrink or become dry, and is 
never greasy. 

Heat the oven at least ten minutes before putting in 
the chicken or bird; 300 Fahr. is just about right. Dust 
the chicken with salt, brush it with a little melted butter, 
put it in a paper bag, fold over the end of the bag and 
fasten it ; place the bag on a grate in a pan, and at once in 
the oven ; cook thirty-five minutes. Slide the chicken from 
the bag to a serving dish, and pour over the sauce. 

TO PAN A CHICKEN 

Draw and split the chicken down the back ; it must not 
weigh over one and a half pounds. Put half of it in a 
granite roasting pan, bone side down, put two or three 
tablespoonfuls of water in the pan, run it in a quick oven 
and bake for thirty-five minutes. If the water evaporates 
quickly, add a little more. When the chicken is half done 
dust it with salt, and if admissible a suspicion of pepper. 
When it is nicely browned dish it on a dainty platter, put a 
little quill of paper over the leg bone, spread over a little 
sweet butter and serve. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 231 

Chickens may stand a moment after they are cooked, 
before serving; they do not become heavy or sodden like 
beef or mutton. 

CHICKEN FRICASSEE 

Select a fowl one year old and not too fat. For the 
sick, use only the white meat. Draw the chicken, take off 
the second joints and with a cleaver or heavy knife chop 
and slash the leg, beginning at the lower bone. Put the 
back and the dark meat in a saucepan, add a quart of cold 
water, bring to boiling point and skim. Cut the breast 
into halves, put these halves on top of the dark meat in 
the saucepan, cover and simmer it gently for two hours, or 
until the white meat is perfectly tender. Remove the white 
meat, put one half aside for other dishes souffle, boudins 
or a mince. For the fricassee, rub together two level tea- 
spoonfuls of butter and two of flour, add a half cupful of 
the liquor in which the chicken was boiled, stir until boil- 
ing and add a half teaspoonful of salt. Add the breast to 
the sauce, cover and stand the saucepan over hot water for 
ten minutes. Have ready boiled, four tablespoonfuls of rice, 
dish the chicken on a dainty little platter, heap the rice at 
one end of the platter and serve. Use the water for broth. 

CHICKEN SOUFFLE 

Chop sufficient cooked white meat of chicken- to make 
four tablespoonfuls; add to it two tablespoonfuls of thick 
cream, a tablespoonful of sifted dry bread crumbs, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and then mix in the well-beaten white of 
one egg. Heap this in a tiny baking or ramekin dish, or 
on a shell ; dust with bread crumbs, brown quickly in a hot 
oven and serve at once. 

It will fall if it stands. 

GERMAN CHICKEN PUFF 

Bake one good-sized potato ; when done, cut off the 
end, scoop out the flesh and put it through a sieve or 



232 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

vegetable press ; add a saltspoonful of salt, four tablespoon- 
fuls of finely-chopped cooked white meat of chicken, mix 
thoroughly, and fold in the well-beaten white of one egg. 
Put this back into the potato "shell," brush the top with 
milk and bake in a quick oven fifteen minutes. 

CHICKEN IN POTATO CASES 

Chop sufficient cold cooked chicken to make four table- 
spoonfuls ; put it in a small saucepan with two tablespoon- 
fuls of cream, half a saltspoonful of salt, and if admissible 
a suspicion of pepper ; cover the saucepan and stand it over 
a teakettle of hot water for ten minutes to heat. Have 
ready baked a good-sized perfect potato, cut a slice from the 
side, or the end, whichever seems best ; scoop out the flesh 
of the potato, leaving a wall a half inch thick. Fill the 
potato with the hot chicken, dish it on a napkin and serve 
at once. 

The portion of the potato scooped out may be used for 
another dish. 

MINCED CHICKEN ON TOAST 

Cut half the white meat of a young chicken into dice. 
Put a teaspoonful of butter and one of flour in a saucepan, 
mix, and add a half cupful of milk, stir over the fire until 
it reaches boiling point, add a saltspoonful of celery salt 
and the chicken ; cover the saucepan and stand it over hot 
water for ten or fifteen minutes. Trim the crust from a 
square of bread and toast it until a golden brown; put it 
on a tiny platter and heap the chicken on top. If admis- 
sible, garnish the top with a teaspoonful of nicely-cooked 
green peas, or a little chopped parsley. 

GOLDEN CHICKEN 

Make precisely the same as minced chicken on toast, 
and when ready to serve, grate over the top the hard-boiled 
yolk of one egg. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 233 

CEYLON CHICKEN 

In cases of long-continued feeding for invalids, the 
aged, or tuberculosis patients, variety is the spice of life. 
Ceylon chicken may be made from any left-over chicken 
that has been carefully cooked, and gives a palatable, easily- 
digested, attractive dish. Cut sufficient cooked white meat 
of chicken to make a half cupful. Grate a cocoanut, pour 
over it a cupful of boiling water, let it stand a minute, stir 
until the cocoanut is thoroughly saturated with the water, 
then put it into a cheesecloth or a bag and squeeze it dry. 
Put the chicken in a saucepan, add a half cupful of the 
cocoanut "milk" thus made, bring it slowly to boiling 
point, add a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of corn- 
starch that has been moistened in a little of the cold cocoa- 
nut "cream." Serve in a border of rice. If the cocoanut 
milk stands but a few minutes the cream will come to the 
surface. The remaining cocoanut "milk" and "cream" may 
be saved for cooking other meats or vegetables. 



CHICKEN TIMBALE 

Cut half the white meat, four ounces, from a young, un- 
cooked chicken; put this raw meat twice through' a meat 
chopper, put it into a bowl, rub it with the back of a spoon 
until it forms a paste; add slowly four tablespoonfuls of 
cream and the unbeaten white of one egg ; when thoroughly 
mixed add a tablespoonful of soft bread crumbs and a salt- 
spoonful of salt. Press this through a fine sieve, and fold 
in the well-beaten white of another egg. Grease two cus- 
tard cups or timbale molds with a little olive oil or melted 
butter, line the bottom with a piece of white paper, fill in 
the mixture, stand them in a baking pan of boiling water, 
cover the tops with oiled paper, and cook in a moderate oven 
about twenty minutes. While these are cooking, rub to- 
gether a teaspoonful of butter and one of flour, add a half 
cupful of milk, stir until boiling, add a saltspoonful of salt, 
and pour on a tiny serving platter; turn out one timbale 



234 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

into the sauce, garnish the dish with a sprig of parsley and 
serve. This is one of the most delicate, easily-digested and 
attractive of the chicken dishes. It is admirable for conva- 
lescing typhoid patients who are allowed solid or semi-solid 
food. 

To Give Variety For another meal heat the mold left 
over by standing it in boiling water over the fire or in the 
oven. If admissible cook a cupful of green peas and press 
them through a sieve; they should be as dry as mashed 
potato. Season nicely with a little salt and butter, put them 
on a serving dish, dish the timbale at one side, or in the 
center, and send to the table. 

JUGGED CHICKEN 

In making chicken broth, save the white meat for 
other dishes. After the chicken has been boiled tender in 
the broth, remove the breasts and put them aside for any 
of the preceding recipes. For jugging: Put half the 
breast while hot in a small baking dish or casserole mold, 
dust it lightly with celery salt, add sufficient stock to just 
cover, sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of rice, cover the 
dish and bake in a moderate oven one hour. Serve in the 
dish in 'which it is cooked. 

LARDED QUAIL 

Clean and truss the bird, wrap around the thinnest pos- 
sible slice of bacon, put it in a small baking dish and run 
it in a quick oven for thirty minutes. Remove the bacon 
and serve on toast. Any other small birds may be dressed 
and cooked after this recipe. 

BROILED CANVASBACK DUCK 

Remove half the breast from a canvasback duck, put 
it in a broiler, broil over a hot fire ten minutes, turning once, 
then dust it lightly with salt, brush it with a little melted 
butter, broil two minutes longer and serve. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 235 

The flavor of the duck is best preserved by cooking it 
quickly and serving it at once on a hot plate. Serve with 
the duck a little boiled rice, currant jelly and very tender 
young celery or lettuce. 

VENISON WITH ORANGE SAUCE 

Grate the yellow rind of half an orange into a sauce- 
pan, add a dash of Tabasco, a half cupful of chicken stock 
and a saltspoonful of salt ; simmer gently about ten min- 
utes, then add the juice of the orange and a tablespoonful 
of port wine ; stand this to keep hot while you quickly broil 
a portion of venison steak. Dish it quickly on a hot plate, 
pour over two tablespoonfuls of the hot sauce and serve. 
Serve venison rare. 

BONED SQUABS 

After the squabs have been carefully picked, cut off 
the legs near the body, and the head and wings. Cut the 
skin down the back, and then with a small, sharp knife 
remove the meat from the carcass, keeping the knife pressed 
flat against the bones. When the leg and wing joints are 
reached, unjoint them quickly without cutting the breast. 
When the flesh has been freed from the bones, put it into 
shape, dust it lightly with salt, and broil quickly as you 
would a chicken. Dish on a heated plate, put over a little 
butter and serve. 

Squabs may be baked whole, without stuffing, and 
served with green peas, to patients who can take solid foods 
of this kind. Convalescing patients, who can eat solid food, 
usually prefer broiled or baked squab on toast, 

BOILED PIGEON 

Draw and truss the bird, put it at once in a kettle of 
boiling water. Boil rapidly five minutes, add a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a bay leaf, cover and cook at 170 Fahr. for an 
hour. Serve hot. 



236 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

SAUCES 

INDIVIDUAL RECIPES 

All sauces are quite easily made. The points to be 
remembered are that the fat and flour must be rubbed 
together and not heated; the liquid material as a rule 
must be added cold, and the sauce stirred over hot water 
until it thickens. For the sick, however, it is wise to add 
the butter last, as in almost all cases heated butter dis- 
agrees. Sauce made according to the following recipes 
may be eaten, by persons who have weak digestion, with- 
out any serious results. Avoid in all cases of sickness heated 
butter. If butter must be added to vegetables or meats, put 
it on after they are dished, which will allow it to melt at 
low temperature. 

SAUCE a la POULETTE 

Beat the yolk of one egg until creamy, add slowly one 
gill (a half cupful) of hot chicken stock or bouillon, and a 
saltspoonful of salt ; stir it over hot water for a minute until 
smooth like mayonnaise; be careful not to curdle. 

BROWN SAUCE 

Put a half cupful of stock in a saucepan, add a level 
teaspoonful of flour moistened in a little cold stock, stir 
and boil five minutes, take from the fire, add half a teaspoon- 
ful of browning or kitchen bouquet, a level teaspoonful of 
butter and a saltspoonful of salt. Strain and it is ready 
for use. 

CREAM SAUCE I 

Put a half cupful (one gill) of milk in a saucepan, over 
a moderate fire, add half a level teaspoonful of cornstarch 
moistened in a tablespoonful of cold milk. When this 
thickens, take it from the fire, add a teaspoonful of butter 
and a saltspoonful of salt. 

A teaspoonful of flour may be substituted for the corn- 
starch. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 237 

CREAM SAUCE II 

Put four tablespoonfuls of cream in a china cup, stand 
it in a little pan of hot water and stir it until it is palatably 
hot, and add a saltspoonful of salt. Use at once. 

This sauce can be used in diabetic cases. 

EGG SAUCE 

Beat the yolk of one egg until creamy, add slowly a 
half cupful (one gill) of boiling water, stirring all the while. 
Stand the cup in a saucepan of hot water, and when the 
sauce is the consistency of mayonnaise take it from the fire, 
add a teaspoonful of butter, a saltspoonful of salt and a 
dash of lemon juice. 

Serve on green vegetables for diabetic, rheumiatic and 
gouty patients. 

MAITRE d'HOTEL 

Beat a tablespoonful of butter to a cream, .adding 
gradually a tablespoonful of lemon juice. When thoroughly 
mixed, stir in one tablespoonful of finely-chopped parsley, 
and a pinch of salt, not more than ten grains. Heap in a 
tiny dish and stand aside until cold. 

Serve on broiled, boiled or baked fish. 

MELTED BUTTER SAUCE 

Put three tablespoonfuls of butter in a china cup, stand 
the cup in a little saucepan of boiling water and let the 
butter quietly melt. Pour off the top, leaving the sediment 
in the bottom. Stand the butter aside to harden. 

This may be used over vegetables or meat dishes, as 
directed. 

Where a restricted diet must be continued for a long 
time, and melted butter is admissible, it is wise to melt a 
half pound at a time in the upper part of a double boiler. 
Butter melted in this way is called, in cooking terms, 
"clarified" butter. 



238 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

TOMATO SAUCE 

Peel two solid, good-sized, ripe tomatoes, cut them into 
halves and squeeze out the seeds. Cut the tomato into bits, 
put it in a granite or porcelain saucepan, cover and stew 
fifteen minutes; press through a sieve. Boil this to the 
proper consistency, take from the fire, add a saltspoonful 
of salt, five grains of powdered mace, and stir in a level 
teaspoonful of butter. 

This may be used in diabetic or other cases where 
tomatoes are allowable. 



APPLE SAUCE 

Wash one large tart apple, cut it into quarters, remove 
the seeds, slice the apple, put it in a saucepan with suffi- 
cient water to cover; cover the saucepan, bring quickly to 
a boil, and press through a sieve. Add a tablespoonful of 
sugar and turn it at once into a sauce boat. 

Serve with roasted duck or goose. 



CRANBERRY SAUCE 

Wash a half pint of cranberries, put them into a porce- 
lain or granite saucepan with one gill (a half cupful) of 
water. Cover the saucepan, bring to boiling point, and 
press through a sieve. Return the pulp to the saucepan, 
add two-thirds of a cupful of sugar, stir until the sugar is 
dissolved, boil five minutes and cool. 



GOOSEBERRY SAUCE 

Top and tail a half pint of ripe gooseberries, put them 
in a saucepan with a half cupful of water. Cover, bring 
to a boil, and press through a sieve. Add two tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar and cool. 

Serve with meats. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 239 

CELERY SAUCE 

Chop fine two of the outside stalks of celery, with 
the green tops. Put them in a saucepan with a half 
pint of cold water, cover, boil slowly for thirty minutes, 
and drain. Thicken with two teaspoonfuls of flour or one 
of cornstarch moistened with a little water. Add a salt- 
spoonful of salt, take from the fire and add a level teaspoonful 
of butter and four tablespoonfuls of milk. 

For diabetic patients thicken this with the yolk of 
egg, and omit the cornstarch and flour.

CONDIMENTS 

This group, salt, pepper, vinegar, such spices as cinna- 
mon, allspice, cloves, mustard, cayenne, nutmeg, mace, 
ginger and curry powder, have not the slightest place in 
diet for the sick. As astringents, some of them may be 
used to advantage in chronic diarrhoea, or just a suspicion 
may be used to liven up some tasteless dish that may be 
beneficial to the patient. 

Perhaps white and black pepper, and mustard, are the 
most dangerous of the group. If pepper is to be used for 
the sick, and I cannot see why it should be, a half drop 
of Tabasco is far less injurious and far more palatable than 
a saltspoonful of black pepper. Black pepper, no matter 
how finely ground, is indestructible and frequently very irri- 
tating, and if used should always be strained out. 

When making cinnamon tea or spice tea, always use 
the whole spices and strain them out. 

A dash of nutmeg is "an improvement to an ordinary 
eggnog. 

Nutmeg and ginger tea are used in cases of chronic 
diarrhoea. 

Avoid mustard except for outward applications. 

In this group we might also place such flavorings as 
vanilla, bitter almond and extracts of lemon and orange. 
I can only say avoid them all. Vanilla is truly medicinal, 
and when made into extract is frequently adulterated with 
harmful materials. 

Use for flavoring the grated yellow rind of an orange 
or lemon, and fresh fruit juices. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 241 

MILK 

Milk is a typical or perfect food. By this we mean it 
contains all the necessary elements to sustain life and build 
and repair the tissues of the young mammalia during the 
period of rapid growth. It is especially suited to the aged, 
invalids and diet for the sick. Milk is a food, not a beverage, 
and must not be taken as a beverage with heavy meals of 
meat and vegetables. It is not a desirable food for active 
adults, and when swallowed rapidly like water, produces 
discomfort and frequently indigestion. 

All foods, liquid, semi-solid and solid, should be masti- 
cated sufficiently long to be mingled with the mouth secre- 
tions. The carbohydrate of milk is lactose or milk sugar, 
not so sweet as cane sugar, and less liable to fermentation. 
Milk for the well and for the sick must be perfectly sweet, 
clean, and should be kept in a cold place, in covered bottles. 
If left open in the refrigerator, it absorbs odors and flavors 
of other foods. It may be used warm, hot or cold, according 
to the physician's orders, but should not in any case be iced. 

THE DIGESTIBILITY OF MILK 

Milk is difficult of digestion when swallowed rapidly, 
because the rennin in the gastric secretions coagulates it 
the same as it does when added to milk for junket. This 
curd remains hard and dense in the stomach for some time, 
causing discomfort and flatulency. Junket is recommended 
because it can be masticated and the curd broken up, which 
aids in its digestion. 

Many people think they cannot take milk, that it makes 
them "bilious," that it disagrees with them ; in nine cases 
out of ten it is because they drink it rapidly. If too weak 
to masticate it, the patient may hold it in the mouth. Water 
gruels added to the curd, make it more acceptable and more 
digestible. If the patient is on the back and the head can- 
not be lifted, give milk and barley water through an 
adjustable glass tube. The patient in drawing the milk 
through the tube excites and draws out the secretions of 

16

the mouth, which mingle with the milk and aid in its 
digestion.

TO CHANGE THE TASTE OF MILK 

In cases where milk feeding must be prolonged, and 
the flavor of raw milk is objectionable, change it, and speak 
of it to the patient, for the mind has great influence over 
the palate. The taste is not natural in fevers ; even the best 
of foods are unattractive. 

CARAMEL MILK 

Put a half cupful of dry sugar into a saucepan and 
stand it over the fire ; in a moment the sugar will melt and 
begin to> smoke ; add a half cupful of water, boil a minute, 
cool and bottle. ' A few drops added to milk will entirely 
change its flavor and will not only make it agreeable but 
attractive to the patient. Caramel will keep for months. 

RAISIN MILK 

Boil twelve raisins in a cup of water for ten minutes ; 
drain, pressing the raisins, and stand this liquid aside to 
cool. When cold add it to a quart of milk. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 243 

CINNAMON MILK 

A stick of cinnamon put into cold milk when it is put 
away in the morning, or a clove, or a bay leaf, will fre- 
quently make it agreeable to people who dislike milk. 

TO STERILIZE MILK 

Sterilized milk is dead milk. In boiling all the natural 
micro-organisms are killed. Boiled milk is more difficult of 
digestion than raw milk, and should never be given to 
infants except under the responsibility of a physician. 
When milk is heated to 212 Fahr., the boiling point of 
water at sea level, it does not necessarily imply that it is 
sterile after it has been cooled, unless it has been boiled in 
bottles stopped with cotton plugs or corks before the boiling. 

Milk boiled in an open x vessel, allowed to cool in it, 
and kept in it, is frequently far more dangerous than raw 
milk. 

To sterilize milk put the milk into perfectly clean 
bottles or jars; if bottles, stop with cotton plugs or clean 
corks cotton plugs are preferable ; if jars, put on the 
tops, give a single turn, stand them in a kettle of cold 
water, cover, bring to boiling point and boil continuously 
for thirty minutes. Take the kettle from the fire, lift the 
lid, allow the milk to cool in the water and put it at once 
in the refrigerator. 

TO PASTEURIZE MILK 

Louis Pasteur, a French chemist of the latter part of 
the last century, found that milk heated to 165 Fahr. was' 
practically free from dangerous bacteria and still retained a 
considerable amount of its own life. As pasteurization kills 
the enzymes in the milk and the lactic acid ferment, it must 
be as carefully cared for as fresh sweet milk. 

Put the milk into scalded bottles, stop the necks with 
cotton plugs that have been thoroughly baked, stand the 
bottles in a large kettle, pour around enough water at 155 



244 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Fahr. to come to the necks of the bottles or jars; be careful 
that they do not float. Take the kettle from the fire, or 
push it to the back part of the stove, where it will remain 
at this temperature for thirty minutes. Lift the bottles, put 
them into a pan of lukewarm water, stand under a cold-water 
spigot and allow a small stream to run in the pan until the 
water becomes cold. Put them in the refrigerator, and do 
not remove the cotton plugs until you are ready to use them. 
Pasteurization may be done in a big soup kettle or a 
small boiler. If, however, it is necessary to pasteurize for 
any length of time, better buy a pasteurizing outfit, which 
can be purchased at any drug store at little cost. Cotton 
plugs can also be purchased, and are far better than corks. 
Before using them, put them on a piece of paper in the 
bottom of a pan, to bake in the oven until slightly colored ; 
put them at once into a scalded dry fruit jar, screw on the 
top and they are then ready for use. 

MODIFIED MILK (Meiggs') 

Mix two ounces of sugar of milk in one pint of pure 
water; stand it on the ice ready for use. At each feeding, 
put one ounce of cream in the feeding bottle, one ounce 
of fresh cows' milk, half an ounce of lime water and one and 
a half ounces of solution of milk sugar. 

ARTIFICIAL MILK 

In cases where the infant cannot take even the above 

amount of cows' milk, make two quarts of skimmed milk 

into junket. Break up the curd with a fork, and strain 

carefully ; bring the whey to a boil, and while hot add a 

level tablespoonful of powdered sugar of milk. When cold, 

add the whites of two eggs to one pint of the whey, shake 

until the whites are thoroughly blended, add them to the 

remaining whey and add a half pint of cream. Keep cold. 

The writer has used these recipes for a number of years 

with excellent results. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 245 

KOUMYS 

Heat two quarts of milk to 100 Fahr., boil together 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of water; add this to 
the milk; dissolve a third of a compressed yeast cake in 
two tablespoonfuls of milk, add it to the milk and fill at 
once into bottles. Cork and tie down the corks the same 
as for champagne ; stand the bottles upright in a tempera- 
ture of 65 Fahr. over night; next morning place them 
carefully on their sides in a cold place, and in twenty-four 
hours it is ready for use. Open the bottles with a cham- 
pagne tap. 

LEBAN 

To make good Leban ( and Matzoon, directions must be 
carefully followed. Put two quarts of milk in a pan over 
the fire; bring it to almost the boiling point and keep it 
there for twenty minutes. When it is covered with a thick 
crust or skin take it from the fire and cool to blood heat, 
98 Fahr. Then lift carefully one side of the skin and stir in 
two tablespoonfuls of the Matzoon or Zoolak, and replace 
the skin carefully without tearing it. Cover the pan, keep 
it in a warm place, about 75 Fahr. for six or seven hours. 
You should have by this time a perfectly thick milk jelly. 
Serve as a milk jelly or remove the skin and stir a moment 
until it is thin enough to bottle. Bottle and keep on the ice. 

Matzoon or Zoolak can be purchased at any first-class 
drug shop. 

This is exceedingly useful in cases of stomach troubles 
and in fevers where sweet milk disagrees. 

KEFIR 

Put one quart of fresh new milk in a perfectly clean 
two-quart fruit jar, stand the jar in a kettle of cold water, 
cover the kettle, bring to boiling point and boil ten minutes. 
Remove the jar and allow the milk to cool to 100 Fahr. 
Crush two Kefilac tablets, add them to the milk in the 
jar, screw on the top, shake thoroughly, loosen the top, then 



246 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

stand it aside at a temperature of 75 for twenty-four hours; 
shake four or five times during the day as the fermentation 
advances and thick curds form. Stand this aside in a cold 
place for twenty-four hours, and it is ready for use. It 
will keep from forty-eight to fifty hours. 

In cases of constipation it should be used at the end 
of the second day. If kefir is to be used any length of 
time, two pints should be made every day, so the patient 
will never be without it. 

KEFIR WITH EGG 

Add, to each feeding of kefir, a tablespoonful of thick 
cream and the white of one egg, beaten. Put the cream and 
white of egg in a glass and fill the glass with kefir, stir, and 
it is ready for use. Excellent in cases of anaemia and tuber- 
culosis. 

MILK, EGGS AND BRANDY 

Scald a half pint of new milk in a double boiler and 
stand it away to cool. Separate one fresh egg, beat the 
white and yolk separately, then mix them together, add a 
teaspoonful of powdered sugar and beat again. Stir into 
this mixture a tablespoonful of brandy, pour the mixture 
into a tumbler and fill the tumbler with the cold scalded 
milk. 

Cold, pasteurized milk or pure raw may be used 
instead of scalded milk. 

MILK, RUM AND ISINGLASS 
Purchase a half ounce of the best isinglass; take one 
little strip which would make a tablespoonful if it were 
powdered, and pour over it a half cupful of warm water; 
let it soak for fifteen or twenty minutes, and stir it over 
hot water until the isinglass is dissolved. Take from the 
fire, add a teaspoonful of powdered sugar and a tablespoon- 
ful of rum. Pour this into a tumbler, and fill the tumbler 
with cold milk. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 247 

ALMOND MILK WITH ISINGLASS 

Put one teaspoonful of powdered isinglass into a half 
pint of fresh milk, soak ten minutes, and when the isinglass 
is dissolved add six almonds that have been blanched and 
pounded or ground very fine, and two lumps of loaf sugar. 
Stir over the fire and cool. 

This is sufficient for one feeding. 

Almond milk with isinglass is very grateful, if taken 
warm, in cases of tonsilitis ; it is also an excellent food 
in certain cases of stomach trouble. Strained, with sugar 
omitted, it may be given in typhoid once or twice a day 
in place of plain milk. 

ASSES' MILK 

Cover two level tablespoonfuls of powdered gelatin 
with a half cupful of cold water, soak ten minutes, then add 
a half pint of boiling rice or barley water, take from the fire 
and strain. When cold add one pint of cows' milk. 

This will be given the same as milk and barley water 
in fever cases. 

TIGER'S MILK 

This is a very desirable hot weather food for old per- 
sons who are inclined to diarrhoea. Add to one quart of 
milk, a quarter teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, the quarter 
of a nutmeg, grated, two drops of oil of orange, and just a 
suspicion of ground cloves. Add the well-beaten whites of 
two eggs and two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Mix, 
strain and keep in the cold. Add to each 'tumblerful, at 
serving time, a tablespoonful of blackberry brandy. Give 
it slowly through a straw. 

ORGEAT 

Blanch and pound twenty-four almonds. Put them in 
a quart of milk, stir well and strain. A very easily-digested 
and nutritive food. A bland demulcent for an irritated 
stomach. 



248 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

MILK AND LIME WATER 

Put a tablespoonful of lime water into a half pint of 
milk; shake it in a fruit jar, turn it into a glass and use 
at once. 

MILK PUNCH 

Shake a half pint of cold milk until it has a slight froth 
on the surface ; then add a tablespoonful of sugar syrup 
and a tablespoonful of brandy or whisky, dust with a little 
nutmeg and serve. 

If admissible, put on top a tablespoonful of whipped 
cream. 

ALBUMINIZED MILK 

Put the white of one egg and a half pint of milk into 
a quart fruit jar, screw on the top and shake it well for a 
half minute, strain and serve at once. Make sure the jar 
and top are perfectly clean. 

GELATINIZED MILK 

Wash a quarter of a box of vegetable gelatin in cold 
water, drain and add one pint of cold milk, soak in a cold 
place for one hour. Put this in a double boiler, stir care- 
fully until the gelatin is dissolved, take from the fire, and 
when cold, add one quart of fresh sweet milk and stand 
aside in a cold place. 

This is very beneficial in cases of inflammatory affec- 
tions of the alimentary canal, is also useful in whooping 
cough and for any disease where the mucous membranes 
are inflamed. 

Plain water may be used if desired, but milk gives a 
greater amount of nourishment. 

PLUM PORRIDGE 

Stone twenty-four large raisins, cover them with a 
half pint of boiling water, boil ten minutes and strain. Heat 
a half pint of milk in a double boiler. Moisten a level 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 249 

teaspoonful of cornstarch in a little cold milk, add it to the 
hot milk, stir until it thickens, and add a saltspoonful of 
salt ; add the raisin water and it is ready for use. This is 
sufficient for two feedings. 

ARROWROOT MILK 

Put a half pint of milk in a double boiler, add one level 
teaspoonful of arrowroot moistened in a little cold water, 
stir until the mixture thickens, cover the vessel and cook 
ten minutes. One teaspoonful of sugar and two table- 
spoonfuls of sherry may be added if admissible. 

ARROWROOT JELLY 

Two Servings 

Put a half pint of milk in a double boiler, add two 
teaspoonfuls of arrowroot moistened in two tablespoonfuls 
of cold milk ; stir until the mixture begins to thicken, cover 
the boiler and cook fifteen minutes. Turn into a small in- 
dividual mold and stand aside to cool. This should be 
shaky and jelly-like, but not too stiff. Serve with powdered 
sugar and cream. 

MILK JELLY 
Two Servings 

Cover two level teaspoonfuls of granulated gelatin with 
a half pint of cold milk, soak for thirty minutes, then heat 
it in a double boiler, or stand the bowl over hot water and 
stir until the gelatin is dissolved. Strain into two fancy 
individual molds, and stand at once on the ice. In case of 
fever, this must be served perfectly plain, without sugar 
or cream. Convalescing patients may dust it with powdered 
sugar and serve it with plain or whipped cream. 

BLANCMANGE 

Two Servings 

Put a half pint of milk in a double boiler; moisten a 
level tablespoonful of cornstarch in three tablespoonfuls 



250 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

of cold milk, add it to the hot milk and cook until thick; 
turn at once into individual molds. At serving time, turn 
these on a dainty dish, dust it thickly with grated macaroon, 
or sprinkle over some blanched almonds that have been 
chopped very, very fine, or serve it with plain cream and 
sugar. 

ARROWROOT MILK GRUEL 
One Serving 

Heat a half pint of milk in a double boiler; add a half 
dozen raisins split into halves, and a teaspoonful of arrow- 
root moistened in two tablespoonfuls of milk; cook until 
thick, and strain. This may be served hot or cold, or, if 
preferable, without sugar; but in certain cases, as phthisis, 
for instance, cream may be added ; at another time, sugar ; 
never both at the same time, as they are apt to cause flatu- 
lency. 

FARINA MILK GRUEL 
One Serving 

Put a half pint of milk in a double boiler, or in a sauce- 
pan and heat it over hot water; sprinkle in a tablespoonful 
of dry farina, stir and cook for twenty minutes. Add a 
saltspoonful of salt, strain, and use hot or cold. 

FARINA BLANCMANGE 

Two Servings 

Wash one and a half tablespoonfuls of farina, drain, 
add a half pint of milk, soak an hour; then cook it in 
a double boiler, until thick, about fifteen minutes ; turn into 
individual molds and serve cold with soft custard sauce, 
plain cream, or with a little sugar. 

GERMAN FLOUR GRUEL 

Put one pint of flour into a small strong muslin bag, 
tie, leaving very little room for swelling. Put this into a 
saucepan of cold water, bring to boiling point and boil five 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 251 

hours. When done, strip off the bag, take off the damp 
outside "skin" of the ball and let it stand in a dry place 
over night. 

To use: Grate enough to make two tablespoonfuls, 
moisten it with a little cold water, then add a half pint 
of boiling water and stir until it reaches boiling point; 
boil about two minutes, take from the fire and when cold 
add a half pint of fresh milk and a pinch of salt. 

This makes an exceedingly nice "bottle food" for in- 
fants when starchy foods are admissible. 



Soak one level teaspoonful of granulated gelatin in 
six tablespoonfuls of cold water for a half hour. Moisten 
a level teaspoonful of arrowroot in two tablespoonfuls of 
cold water, then add hastily a half pint of boiling water, 
boil until clear, then add the gelatin, stir until it is dis- 
solved, add two lumps of cut loaf sugar, and when cool 
add one gill of good cream. 

Use warm in cases of diarrhoea. 

This also makes a very nice change to the diet of a 
"bottle baby" who is inclined to constipation. Use sugar 
of milk in place of cut sugar. 

BARLEY GRUEL 

One Serving 

Put a half pint of milk in a double boiler, add one level 
teaspoonful of barley meal moistened in a little cold milk ; 
soak an hour, and cook for at least twenty minutes. Take 
from the fire, add a grain of salt, and cool. 

With cream, this makes a nice supper soup for children 
or the aged. 

BARLEY JELLY 

Wash two tablespoonfuls of pearled barley through 
several cold waters, cover with boiling water, boil and 
drain, throwing the water away. Put it in a granite or 



252 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

porcelain kettle with a pint and a half of water, boil slowly 
for two hours, until the quantity is reduced to one pint; 
'strain and stand aside until cold. When cold, this will be 
a clear, white jelly. Serve it in a small cereal plate, with 
two or three tablespoonfuls of cream. This is a nice 
"cereal" for children two or three years of age. 

One ounce of barley jelly dissolved in six ounces of 
sweet milk, with two tablespoonfuls of cream added, is rec- 
ommended for a child, a year old, who is troubled with 
constipation ; it may be used twice a day, as long as neces- 
sary. 

BLACK CURRANT GRUEL 

Stir two tablespoonfuls of black currant jelly into one 
quart of boiling water, boil rapidly fifteen minutes, strain 
and add two teaspoonfuls of arrowroot moistened in a 
little cold water; bring again to boiling point and stand 
it near the ice to use as wanted. 

Useful in cases of diarrhoea. 

BLACKBERRY GRUEL 

Wash two tablespoonfuls of ordinary rice through sev- 
eral cold waters ; add one quart of water, bring to boiling 
point and keep it just below boiling point, for one hour. 
Strain, add one whole clove, a bit of cinnamon one inch 
long, a half teaspoonful of dry Jamaica ginger and a half 
tumblerful of blackberry jelly or jam, bring to boiling point 
and cover in a warm place for a half hour. Strain through 
two thicknesses of cheesecloth and stand near the ice. 

This is very useful in cases of acute or chronic 
diarrhoea and in dysentery. It is nutritious and astringent. 

RICE GRUEL 

Follow the directions given for Barley Gruel, using a 
tablespoonful of rice flour in the place of a tablespoonful 
of barley meal. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 253 

LENTIL MILK GRUEL 

This is used considerably in the German hospitals for 
nursing mothers. 

1 pint of milk A saltspoonful of celery seed 

2 level tablespoonfuls of lentil A saltspoonful of salt 

powder 

Put the milk in a double boiler, add the meal moistened 
in a little cold water, soak an hour, add the celery seed 
and salt, cover the saucepan and cook thirty minutes ; and 
it is ready for use. This will make two meals. Divide it 
and put one part aside to cool ; reheat at serving time. 

YE PERFECT FOOD 

y 2 pint of milk 2, level tablespoonfuls of pearled 

T/2 pint of chicken broth sago 

Yolks of two eggs 

Put the sago into the broth and stand it aside over 
night; next morning bring it to boiling point and cook 
until the sago is transparent; add the milk, take from the 
fire, add a palatable seasoning of salt, and stir in the yolks 
of the eggs that have been carefully beaten with two table- 
spoonfuls of milk or cream. 

This is an exceedingly concentrated, nutritive and pal- 
atable food. The quantity given will make three feedings. 

SCORCHED RICE GRUEL 

Six Servings 

2 tablespoonfuls of rice 2. quarts of water 

A piece of cinnamon two inches I tablespoonful of orange mar- 
long malade 
A pint of milk 

Put the rice in a pan, stir in the oven until well 
browned, then grind it in the coffee mill. Add to it the 
water and cinnamon and cook slowly for two hours ; add 
the orange marmalade and strain. Add the milk and stand 
aside at once to cool. There should be one and a half quarts 
of gruel when finished. 



254 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Use cold in cases of diarrhoea. It may be served hot or 
cold. 

BROWNED RICE FLOUR GRUEL 

Put a half pound of rice flour into a granite baking 
pan in the oven ; shake and stir it, now and then, until 
every little grain of the flour is lightly browned. Take it 
from the oven and when it is cold put it in a glass jar, and 
cover it. 

To Make the Gruel : Moisten two tablespoonfuls of the 
browned flour in six tablespoonfuls of cold water, add a 
half pint of freshly-boiled water, stir until boiling and 
cook over a slow fire for a half hour. 

Serve plain, or with milk, or add two tablespoonfuls 
of cream. With an addition of an equal quantity of milk 
this makes an admirable summer bottle food for infants 
with teeth, especially where there is an inclination to 
diarrhoea. It is also an excellent food for the aged and 
those who have weak digestion. 

GUM AND MILK GRUEL 

Put one ounce of finely-powdered white gum Arabic 
in a half pint of cold water, soak for two hours, add a pint 
of new milki three lumps of loaf sugar or a large table- 
spoonful of honey, and stir over the fire until the gum is 
dissolved. Strain, and when cool add a tablespoonful of 
port wine, if admissible. 

This is exceedingly good in cases of throat trouble, and 
with an additional pint of milk is frequently used in cases 
of tuberculosis. 

CORNMEAL GRUEL 

Wash six tablespoonfuls of yellow or white granu- 
lated cornmeal through several cold waters; after the last 
washing let it settle and pour off the water; add four table- 
spoonfuls of this washed meal to a quart of boiling water, 
boil carefully two hours, strain and stand aside until wanted. 
At serving time, heat sufficient for one feeding about two- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 255 

thirds of a cupful pour it into a bowl over two table- 
spoonfuls of whipped cream, stirring all the while, and add 
a saltspoonful of salt. 

ARROWROOT GRUEL 

Moisten a teaspoonful of arrowroot in two tablespoon- 
fuls of cold water; add slowly a half pint of boiling water, 
and boil ten minutes. Pour, while hot, into the well-beaten 
white of one egg, add a saltspoonful of salt and serve. Cream 
may be substituted for egg if so desired. 

MEIGGS' GRUEL 

Put a level tablespoonful of gelose into a bowl, add a 
pint of milk and stand it in a cold place for one hour. 
Then add six almonds that have been blanched and chopped 
very fine ; put it in a double boiler and cook until the gelose 
is dissolved, strain, add three lumps of loaf sugar and four 
tablespoonfuls of cream. 

This may be used in hyperacidity, omitting the sugar; 
for children, hot or cold in place of milk. In typhoid omit 
sugar and use it cold. 

WINE WHEY 

Put one pint of milk into a saucepan ; heat gently to 
160 Fahr., add four tablespoonfuls of sherry, strain 
through two thicknesses of cheesecloth and it is ready for 
use. 

A quart of this may be made early in the day and kept 
in a cold place, and used as needed. The recipe is for a 
single feeding. 

RENNET WHEY 

Heat a quart of milk to blood heat ; add one teaspoon- 
ful of rennet essence dissolved in two tablespoonfuls of 
water; allow the milk to stand until it solidifies; then break 
the curd with a fork or egg beater, turn it into a cheese- 
cloth and allow it to drain; put at once into a cold place 
and use as needed. 



256 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

LEMON WHEY 

Heat a pint of milk to 160 Fahr., add hastily the juice 
of a lemon, strain and use. This may be sweetened if 
sugar is allowed. 

TAMARIND WHEY 

Heat a pint of milk to 160 Fahr. Stir in a tablespoon- 
ful of tamarind pulp that has been moistened in a little 
water; as soon as the curd separates, strain and stand aside 
to cool. 

This is exceedingly good in cases of fever or chronic 
constipation. 

ALBUMINIZED WHEY 

Heat one quart of milk to 98 Fahr., add two table- 
spoonfuls of rennin essence or two junket tablets. Stand 
this aside until the milk solidifies, then break it with a fork, 
and strain it through cheesecloth, saving the whey. When 
the whey is perfectly cold, put half of it into a quart jar and 
add the unbeaten whites of two eggs. Screw on the top 
of the jar, shake until the eggs and whey are thoroughly 
blended, strain through a fine sieve into the remaining por- 
tion of whey, and stand aside in a cold place. 

Use in cases of acute gastritis. 

POSSET 

Put a half pint of milk in a saucepan; heat to 
160 Fahr., add four tablespoonfuls of good sherry and 
three lumps of loaf sugar; stir for a moment, bring to a 
boil and strain. 

MULLED PORT WINE 

Put one clove, a grating of nutmeg, a bit of stick cin- 
namon, a little piece of mace and a bay leaf in a saucepan, 
with a half cupful of milk; bring to a boil, add six table- 
spoonfuls of good port wine and two lumps of loaf sugar 
a.nd strain. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 257 

This is usually served warm with tiny bits of toasted 
bread. 

Claret may be used in cases where port does not agree 
and water may be substituted for milk. 

CLOTTED CREAM 

Strain new milk into shallow round granite or new tin 
pans and stand it in a cold place over night. In the morning 
lift the pans carefully, place them over a mild fire and heat 
slowly until the milk reaches 200 Fahr. Watch carefully and 
you will notice a ring appearing on the top of the cream; if 
the sides of the pan slant, the ring will be the size of the bot- 
tom of the pan. Take from the fire and stand away in a cold 
place for twenty-four hours. The cream will now be a com- 
pact, thick mass ; lift it carefully with a skimmer, put it into 
glass tumblers and keep on or near the ice. 

VELVET CREAM 

One Serving 

Cover one teaspoonful of granulated gelatin with two 
tablespoonfuls of milk, soak thirty minutes, add four table- 
spoonfuls of milk, stir it carefully over hot water until the 
gelatin dissolves ; then add a half cupful of cream, mix and 
turn at once into an individual mold or a glass punch cup ; 
stand aside until it solidifies. This may be served plain or 
with extra cream. Where sugar is allowable, add a table- 
spoonful to the heating gelatin. 

TO WHIP CREAM 

Cream, to whip well, must be at least thirty-six hours 
old and very cold ; put it in a bowl, stand the bowl in 
another of cracked ice and, with an ordinary egg beater, 
or a wire spoon, whip quickly, until it is solid to the bot- 
tom. Stop whipping, or it will be greasy. Serve heaped 
on a dainty glass dish or in a punch cup. It may be flavored 
with sherry or a little grated yellow orange rind, or it may 
be dusted with the powdered sugar.

258 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

RENNET PUFFS 

Heat a quart of milk until lukewarm, add a tablespoon- 
ful of rennet essence or a junket tablet, mix and stand 
aside thirty minutes. Stir the mixture, which should now 
be solid, until the curd is separated from the whey ; drain 
through a sieve. Put the curd in a bowl, add a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter, a half teaspoonful of salt, and if admis- 
sible a dash of pepper ; beat, with an egg beater, until very 
light, fill it into little custard cups and stand them on the ice. 
At serving time turn the "puff" from the cup, pour over 
plain cream and serve. A few blanched, unroasted almonds 
are a nice accompaniment. 

SCHMIERKASE 

Few persons realize the difference between genuine 
schmierkase and ordinary cottage cheese. To make the 
"kase" turn two quarts of milk in a pan and stand it in a 
warm place until it forms a thick curd. Cut the curd 
with a knife so it will separate nicely from the whey. Pour 
over two quarts of boiling water, turn it in a muslin bag, 
and hang it to drain, over night. In the morning put the 
portion to be served into a bowl and beat with an egg 
beater at least two minutes ; season lightly with salt, and 
add sufficient sweet cream to make it the desired consist- 
ency, beat again, put it into the serving dish, put a table- 
spoonful of thick cream over the top and stand aside to 
cool. 

MULLED BUTTERMILK 

Put one quart of buttermilk in a double boiler over the 
fire until the water in the underneath boiler boils rapidly ; 
add one tablespoonful of cornstarch moistened in a little 
cold water, stir this for a minute, add the beaten yolks of 
three eggs, stir, over the fire, a minute longer. Take from 
the fire, add a pint of cold buttermilk and stand aside to 
cool. Serve warm or cold. 

Good in cases of alcoholism.

RECIPES FOR THE PREPARATION OF 
PEPTONIZED MILK 

QUICK PROCESS 

Put one ounce of pure cold water into a tumbler, dis- 
solve it in quarter of the contents of a Fairchild's peptonizing 
tube ; stir this for a minute, add four ounces of milk that has 
been heated to 98 Fahr., stir and use immediately, sipping 
slowly. 

COLD PROCESS 

When warm peptonized milks are objectionable, use the 
cold process. Select a clean quart fruit jar, put in the con- 
tents of a Fairchild's peptonizing tube, add one gill of cold 
water, stir carefully for at least two minutes, then add one 
pint of sweet milk; screw the top on the jar and shake thor- 
oughly. Stand the jar in the top of the refrigerator, next to 
the ice. Do this about one hour before feeding time. When 
needed, shake the jar again, pour out the required portion 
and use the same as ordinary milk. Keep the remaining 
quantity next to the ice. 

PARTIALLY PEPTONIZED MILK 

Put into a glass jar the contents of one of Fairchild's 
peptonizing tubes, add one gill of cold water, stir a min- 
,ute and add a pint of sweet, fresh milk; stand the jar in a 
saucepan of cold water, stir constantly until the water sur- 
rounding the jar boils, then stand aside to cool. When cold 
pour this carefully into a clean receptacle and put it in the 
ice chamber. Shake the bottle each time before pouring 
out the required portion. 

This may be served cold or hot, as the case may re- 
quire, and according to the physician's orders. If this is 
carefully prepared it is much more palatable than ordinary 
peptonized milk. 



260 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

PEPTONIZED MILK 

Put the contents of one of Fairchild's peptonizing tubes 
in a clean quart jar, add one gill of cold water, stir one 
minute, add a pint of fresh, sweet milk, screw the top on 
the jar and shake until thoroughly mixed. Place the bottle 
in a saucepan of warm water, about 150 Fahr., keep it 
there for ten minutes, then remove the bottle and place it 
near the ice. The degree of digestion required may be 
regulated by the length of time that the jar is kept in 
the warm water. Sometimes five minutes will answer; 
where more thoroughly digested milk is required ten or 
fifteen minutes is sufficient. 

PEPTONIZED GRUEL 

Milk gruels may be peptonized according to the pre- 
ceding recipe. Arrowroot, German flour gruel are perhaps 
the best of the farinaceous materials to be chosen. 

PEPTONIZED MILK WITH CARBONATED OR 
EFFERVESCING WATERS 

Fill the glass half full of the peptonized milk, add two 
or three tablespoonfuls of shaved ice (if the ice is pure), 
and fill the glass from a siphon of the effervescing waters. 

The following recipes for digested and partly-digested 
foods are printed by permission of Fairchild Brothers and 
Foster, and are intended for Fairchild's Peptonizing Tubes, 
their Essence of Pepsin and other digestive ferments. 

LAIBOSE 

This preparation is made from the solids of milk, mixed 
with entire whole wheat, well cooked. The average 
approximate composition of laibose is as follows: Total 
dry solids, 94% ; protein iS% ; fat 17% ; carbohydrate 55% ; 
ash potassium and lime phosphates, etc.) 4% a nutritive 
balance of one part of protein to three of carbohydrate ; and

a heat and energy (caloric) coefficient of five to one of 
protein.

DIRECTIONS FOR THE USE OF LAIBOSE 

Two level tablespoonfuls or one heaping tablespoon- 
ful (one ounce by weight) is a convenient and usual pro- 
portion. Put the Laibose into a dry porcelain bowl, moisten 
with a little cold water, stirring- until smooth ; then add 
boiling water to suit. Laibose may, however, be mixed 
simply with cold water and taken without cooking. 

SPECIALLY PEPTONIZED MILK 

For Making Milk Jelly, Milk Punch, Milk Lemonade, and for use with 
Fruit Juices or Acids 

Peptonize a pint of milk by the "Warm Process," 
keeping the bottle in the water bath for one hour; pour 
the peptonized milk into a saucepan and heat to boiling, 



262 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

when it is ready for use if it is required hot; or it may be 
put on ice, in a bottle or any suitable container, to be used 
for punches, lemonade, etc. 

It is necessary to peptonize the milk quite completely 
for one hour so that it will not curdle when mixed with 
lemon juice or acid. The bitter taste of this "specially 
peptonized milk" is not evident in the jellies, punches, etc., 
and these foods are very agreeable and exceedingly assim- 
ilable. 

v 

PEPTONIZED MILK JELLY 

1 pint "specially peptonized milk," hot 
y* box best gelatin 

Sugar to taste 

Rinds and juice of one fresh lemon and orange 

2 or 3 tablespoonfuls best St. Croix rum, or brandy, etc. 

Soak the gelatin in a teacupful of cold water, pour 
the hot milk over it and add the sugar; stir until dis- 
solved, then throw in the lemon and orange rinds. 

Squeeze the juice of the lemon and orange into a glass 
and strain ; stir in the rum or brandy, etc., then mix with 
the milk and gelatin; strain. 

When the mixture has cooled to a syrup so as to be 
almost ready to set, pour into molds or glasses wet in cold 
water and put on ice or in cold water or in a cold place 
to harden ; if it is too warm when poured into the molds, 
it is apt to separate in setting. 

PEPTONIZED MILK PUNCH 

Take a goblet about one-third full of finely-crushed 
ice, add a tablespoonful of St. Croix rum, a dash of curacao, 
or any liquor that is agreeable to the taste; fill the glass 
with "specially peptonized milk," stir well and grate a little 
nutmeg on top. 

"Specially peptonized milk" may be used in the same 
way as fresh milk in making punches with St. Croix rum 
or Jamaica, or any spirits that may be preferred. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 263 

PEPTONIZED MILK LEMONADE 

Take a goblet one-third full of finely-crushed ice; add 
the juice of a lemon, and sugar to taste ; fill the glass with 
"specially peptonized milk" and stir well. 

If preferred, equal parts of the peptonized milk and 
mineral water may be used instead of milk alone, the min- 
eral water being first poured on the ice and then the milk 
added; this makes a very agreeable effervescing punch. 

HOT PEPTONIZED MILK AS A BEVERAGE 

Hot peptonized milk is a grateful and nourishing bev- 
erage for invalids, dyspeptics, diabetics and consumptives. 
In many cases, it is most helpful in the morning, taken 
upon rising, or with breakfast, and it is excellent at any 
time when one suffers from exhaustion with intolerance of 
solid food. There is nothing better in the way of nourish- 
ment to take before retiring than hot peptonized milk, and 
at the table it is a good substitute for tea or coffee. 

PEPTONIZED MILK WITH CEREALS 

Oatmeal, rice, hominy, etc., are more readily digestible 
when taken with peptonized milk, and its use with the 
various cereals is especially recommended for young chil- 
dren and children with defective digestion. 

PEPTONIZED MILK GRUEL 

Mix a half pint of well-boiled hot gruel with a half 
pint of cold fresh milk and strain into a pitcher or jar; add 
immediately the powder contained in one of the Peptoniz- 
ing Tubes (Fairchild) and stir until it is dissolved. Put 
the pitcher or jar in a hot water bath or warm place for 
five minutes ; then pour the mixture into a clean bottle and 
place on ice ; serve hot or cold. 

The gruel may be made from arrowroot, wheat flour, 
barley, or oatmeal, etc. ; but in each instance the farinaceous 



264 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

material should be boiled with water until the starch 
granules are thoroughly swollen and broken up. 

PARTIAL DIGESTION OF FARINACEOUS FOODS 
AT THE TABLE 

To a dish of well-cooked porridge of oatmeal, wheaten 
grits, or rice, etc., as warm as agreeable, add one or two 
teaspoonfuls of Diazyme Essence and stir for a few min- 
utes, until thoroughly mixed. 

The food must not be hotter than can be agreeably 
borne by the mouth, or the digestive principle will be 
destroyed. 

Extractum Pancreatis may be used in the same man- 
ner, a measureful of the dry powder instead of a teaspoon- 
ful of Diazyme Essence. This powder imparts no taste 
or odor to the food and is handy to use. It contains also 
the other digestive principles those capable of digesting 
milk, fat, etc., and thus aids in the digestion of the foods 
taken with the cereal. 

PEPTONIZED BEEF 

To a quarter pound of finely-minced, raw lean beef 
add a half-pint of cold water; cook over a slow fire to 
boiling and boil for a few minutes, stirring constantly from 
the beginning. Pour off the liquor and set it aside; rub 
the meat to a paste and put it into a clean glass jar or 
bottle with the liquor and a half pint of cold water; add 

Extractum Pancreatis 4 measures* (20 grs.) 

Soda Bicarbonate I measure (15 grs.) 

mixed thoroughly into one powder ; 

shake all well together and stand in a warm place, about 
no to 115 Fahr., for three hours, stirring or snaking occa- 

*Extractum Pancreatis can be obtained of any druggist, in I oz. 
bottles. With each oz. package are two measures one for 5 grs. Ex- 
tractum Pancreatis and one for 15 grs. Soda Bicarbonate. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 265 

sionally, then boil quickly, strain, d"r clarify with white of 
egg in the usual manner; season to taste. 

This final boiling is essential ; if omitted, digestion 
will progress until the food is spoiled. 

For the great majority of cases, it is not necessary to 
strain the peptonized beef, for the portions remaining un- 
dissolved are so softened under the action of the Extractum 
Pancreatis that they are diffused in an almost impalpable 
condition in a form readily susceptible to digestion in the 
body. 

Chicken meat, alone, or mixed with an equal portion 
of beef, may be prepared in the same way. 

A cereal gruel, of wheat, arrowroot, etc., may be in- 
corporated with the beef, thus giving a food combination 
that is often highly desirable. 

The gruel is prepared in the usual manner, the dry 
cereal mixed perfectly smooth with cold water and cooked 
slowly in a double boiler until gelatinized. Four ounces 
of this gruel may be added to the meat paste, liquor, water 
and peptonizing powder as directed above, and the further 
details of the process carried out just as with the beef 
alone. 

The Extractum Pancreatis will at the same time digest 
both the meat and starch (of the gruel). The broth with 
the cereal is more agreeable than when made of meat alone. 

The peptonized beef or peptonized beef and cereal may 
also be made into a jelly. 



PEPTONIZED OYSTERS 
(Originally Suggested by Dr. M. A. Randolph) 

To a half dozen large oysters with their juice add a 
half pint of cold water; heat in a saucepan to boiling and 
boil briskly for a few m,inutes; pour off the broth and set 
it aside. 



266 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Mince the oysters finely and reduce to a paste with a 
potato masher, in a wooden bowl; put in a glass jar with 
the broth and add 

Extractum Pancreatis 3 measures* (15 grs.) 

Soda Bicarbonate i measure (15 grs.) 

mixed thoroughly into one powder. 

Let the jar stand in hot water or in a warm place, 
where the temperature is not above 115 Fahr., for an hour 
and a half. Then pour into a saucepan, stir in a half pint 
of milk and heat slowly to boiling point. Season to taste 
and serve hot. 

The boiling is essential to prevent further digestion 
and keep the broth from spoiling. 

If heated gradually, the milk will be sufficiently 
digested before the mixture boils. 

The very small bits of oyster that remain undissolved 
may be strained out, or rejected in eating the soup, but 
are rarely unacceptable to the stomach. 



*Extractum Pancreatis can be obtained of any druggist, in I oz. 
bottles. With each oz. package are two measures one for 5 grs. Ex- 
tractum Pancreatis and one for 15 grs. Soda Bicarbonate.

Put into a small teacup one or two teaspoonfuls' of 
clean crushed ice ; add one tablespoonful of Panopepton, 
stir, then fill the cup with whey. Drink slowly. 



270 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



JUNKET AND WHEY 

The milk foods familiarly known as junket and whey 
are now included in the modern "diet list" for the sick, 
convalescent, invalid and dyspeptic. The prestige of these 
foods is directly due to the certainty and satisfaction with 
which they have been long prepared by means of Essence 
of Pepsin. 



THE JUNKET, SOFT, SEMI-SOLID MILK 

so prepared presents the entire milk in a semi-solid, jelly- 
like form, especially agreeable to patients who are obliged 
to refrain for the most part from solid food, and who do 
not well tolerate plain milk. The junket gives a sense of 
substance, yet is extremely diffusible and digestible. It 
may be made extra nutritious by the addition of an egg 
(or yolk) ; may be flavored if desired with coffee, cocoa, 
vanilla, etc. The plain junket is often used to great 
advantage in the dietary of children after weaning. 

THE WHEY 
ITS ANALYSIS 

Proteins (soluble) 0.79% 

Lactose 4-73% 

Ash 0.44% 

Fat a. trace 

contains the soluble albuminoids, sugar and saline con- 
stituents of the milk and (in suspension) the particles of 
casein and fat which may pass through the strainer. Whey 
is excellent as a means of varying the diet of the sick, 
often of special service in fevers allaying thirst, refresh- 
ing, nourishing; proves a valuable resource as a food for 
infants in cases of difficult feeding and under conditions 
where "rest feeding" is indicated. 



MRS. RORER^S DIET FOR THE SICK 271 

TO MAKE JUNKET AND WHEY 

JUNKET 

Into a small clean bowl put one teaspoonful of Pep- 
sencia (Essence of Pepsin, Fairchild) and add one-half 
pint of fresh cool milk; stir gently to mix thoroughly. 
Place the bowl containing the milk and Pepsencia in a dish 
or pan of larger size and pour into the larger dish or pan 
boiling water sufficient to come to the level of the mixture, 
Let the bowl stand in the hot water for two minutes, then 
remove and let it stand until the milk is firmly jellied, when 
the junket is ready for use, just as it is, or with sugar, 
grated nutmeg, etc. To keep the junket, put it on ice or in 
a very cold place. 

If preferred, the milk and Pepsencia as soon as thor- 
ougly mixed in the bowl may be divided into small cups, 
these placed in a dish or pan, boiling water poured around 
them and the rest of the directions followed as above. The 
junket in small cups is more attractive to the patient. 



WHEY 

Prepare junket by the formula above (using a pint of 
milk and two teaspoonfuls of Pepsencia if a larger quan- 
tity of whey is desired). When the milk is firmly jellied, 
beat with a fork until it is finely divided, then strain, and 
the whey (liquid part) is ready for use. The whey must 
be kept cold on ice or in a very cold place. 



WHEY AND MILK MODIFICATIONS 

If the whey is to be used with milk, in a milk-and- 
whey modification, it should be heated to at least 150 Fahr. 
as soon as strained ; if not thus heated, it will curdle the 
milk. The whey may be strained quite clear if this seems 
desirable. 



272 MRS. RORER'S DIET FO"R THE SICK 

WHEY WITH GRAPE JUICE 

Prepare whey with Pepsencia as directed, using one 
pint of milk; strain through cheesecloth to remove curds; 
add the juice of one lemon, one pint of grape juice, and 
sugar to sweeten ; strain again through cheesecloth and 
place in ice chest ; serve on finely-cracked ice, or with an 
equal quantity of carbonic water; or freeze and serve as an 
ice. The lemon juice may be omitted, in which case the 
sugar is unnecessary. 

EGG JUNKET 

Beat to a froth one strictly fresh egg; sweeten with one 
or two teaspoonfuls of sugar; stir in thoroughly one-half 
pint of fresh cool milk; add one teaspoonful of Pepsencia ; 
stir again to mix thoroughly ; divide into small cups if pre- 
ferred ; prepare in precisely the same manner as the plain 
junket. A little nutmeg or cinnamon may be grated over 
the junket. To keep the egg junket, put it on ice or in a 
very cold place. 

COCOA JUNKET 

Mix an even tablespoonful of any good cocoa with two 
teaspoonfuls of sugar; scald with two tablespoonfuls of 
boiling water ; rub this paste smooth ; stir in thoroughly 
one-half pint of fresh cool milk ; add one teaspoonful of 
Pepsencia ; stir again to mix thoroughly ; divide into small 
cups if preferred ; prepare in precisely the same manner 
as the plain junket. This cocoa junket may be placed on 
ice and taken cold ; as a dessert, may be served with 
whipped cream. 

COFFEE JUNKET 

Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of sugar in two tablespoon- 
fuls of clear strong coffee ; stir in thoroughly one-half pint 
of fresh cool milk; add one teaspoonful of Pepsencia; stir 
again to mix thoroughly; divide into small cups if pre- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 273 

ferred; prepare in precisely the same manner as the plain 
junket. This coffee junket may be placed on ice and taken 
cold; as a dessert, may be served with whipped cream. 

VANILLA, BITTER ALMOND OR STRAWBERRY 

JUNKET 

Add the flavoring- a half teaspoonful of vanilla, or 
bitter almond extract, or a tablespoonful of pure concen- 
trated strawberry syrup, to a half pint of fresh cool milk; 
add a teaspoonful of Pepsencia and prepare as usual. 

FROZEN JUNKET 

Prepare junket with Pepsencia as directed; add one- 
half the quantity of pure cream; pour at once into the 
freezer and freeze the same as ice cream.

. EGGS 

Eggs are next in importance to milk in diet for the sick, 
and for invalids, children and the aged. They are nitroge- 
nous, taking the place of meat, fish or milk. 

The digestibility of an egg is governed largely by the 
method of cooking. Coddled, poached or soft boiled, they 
are easily digested. A raw egg eaten unseasoned is not so 
quickly digested as one lightly cooked. An ordinary hard- 
boiled egg is very difficult of digestion, both yolk and white. 
When properly hard boiled, however, the yolk is quite as 
easy of digestion as a soft-cooked egg. 

The yolk of an egg is frequently added to liquid foods 
to increase their nutritive value. In cases of chronic or 
acute gastritis and flatulent dyspepsia, the white of an egg 
is more easily digested than the yolk. It may be beaten 
with fruit juice, or thoroughly shaken with milk or any of 
the water gruels. 

Eggs may be used freely in tuberculosis, asthma, ton- 
silitis, quinsy and chronic diarrhoea, the white should be 
avoided by those who are subject to flatulency, gastritis 
with dilatation, chronic gastritis, intestinal catarrh and 
Bright's disease. 

Wash the shells of all eggs thoroughly before cooking 
them. 

To ascertain the freshness of an egg without breaking 
it, drop it in a bucket of cold water; if it topples around 
in the water or stands on its ends, it is fairly fresh, but 
should be rejected as food for invalids; if it floats do not 
use it at all ; but if it sinks quickly to the bottom and falls 
on its side it is perfectly safe. 

CODDLED EGGS 

This is one of the best methods of cooking eggs for 
the sick. 

Drop one or two eggs into a quart of boiling water ; the 
water may be either in a kettle, or a saucepan with a lid; 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 275 

cover and stand on a table away from the fire, six minutes, 
or if the eggs are to be served very soft, five minutes. Serve 
in a hot cup. If cooked correctly the white will be con- 
gealed but soft, while the yolks will be quite well cooked. 

SHIRRED EGGS 

Select a small individual egg dish or ramekin, cover the 
bottom with a few fresh bread crumbs, drop in one fresh 
egg, stand the dish in a pan of hot water and in a moderate 
oven until the egg is "set" and looks like a poached egg; 
dust it with salt, put on a bit of butter and serve at once. 

POACHED EGGS 

Drop a perfectly fresh egg into a saucepan of boiling 
water; sprinkle over a little salt, and pull the pan to the 
side of the stove where the water cannot possibly boil. 
Have ready a piece of toast the shape of the egg but a 
little larger; butter it quickly, lift the egg on an egg-slice 
or skimmer, with a spoon cut off the ragged edges, and slide 
it carefully on the toast. 

EGGS, HUNGARY 

Boil four tablespoonfuls of rice in plenty of water; 
when very tender, drain, and arrange neatly in the center 
of an individual platter; put on top a nicely poached egg, 
and, on top of this, a tablespoonful of cream sauce. 

EGGS, VIRGINIA 

Score the center of each row of grains on one ear 
of corn ; with a dull knife scrape out the pulp, being very 
careful not to get one particle of the hull. Put the pulp 
in a saucepan or cup, stand it over hot water for twenty 
minutes, until thoroughly cooked. When ready to serve, 
put a round of toast in the middle of the platter, season 
the corn with a little salt, add a tablespoonful of cream, 



276 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

and pour it over the toast. Place in the center one well- 
poached egg.. Dust with salt and serve. 

An excellent luncheon for a child or the aged. 

FRENCH POACHED EGGS 

Fill a deep saucepan two-thirds full of boiling water, 
put it over a quick fire where it will boil rapidly. Take a 
wooden paddle or spoon, stir rapidly around the edge until 
the water forms a whirlpool, with a hole in the center. 
Break two fresh eggs into two saucers, drop one in the 
center of the water, keep up the whirling, drop in the sec- 
ond, keep the spoon going around the edge until the eggs 
are coagulated on the outside. Lift them carefully with a 
skimmer and put at once into an egg cup. 

The French fry their eggs in the same manner, keeping 
the fat whirling. Fried eggs cannot be recommended, how- 
ever, for the sick. 

EGGS a la MARTIN 

One Serving 

Rub a teaspoonful of butter and a teaspoonful of flour 
together and add four tablespoonfuls of milk ; stir over the 
fire until the milk reaches boiling point, add a quarter of 
a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of black pepper. Put half 
of this sauce in a ramekin dish, break in one whole egg, 
put the remaining sauce over the top, dust over a few 
bread crumbs, stand the dish in a pan of water and bake 
until the white of the egg is "set." Serve at once. 

FLUFFED EGGS 

Separate one egg, being very careful not to break the 
yolk. Stand the yolk in the shell in a dish of salt or flour, 
anything that will keep it straight; beat the white until it is 
very light, put it in a saucer or an individual dish, make a 
little well in the center, drop in the yolk, stand the dish in a 
pan of hot water, cover and steam for about a minute and 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 277 

a half; take from the fire, put a piece of butter, the size of a 
large pea, on the yolk, dust it with a little salt and serve it at 
once. This is one of the most easily-digested of all the egg 
dishes ;' it is not only palatable, but sightly. 

EGG FLIP 

Separate an egg; beat the white until it is very, very 
stiff; add a teaspoonful of powdered sugar, beat again, drop 
into it the yolk and beat until mixed ; if admissible, add a 
teaspoonful of brandy; heap this into a glass saucer, dust 
with powdered sugar, and serve. 

In incurable troubles, where all food seems to disagree, 
the stomach will frequently bear an egg flip with ease. Of 
course the brandy may be omitted ; sherry may be added or 
it may be served plain; do not add flavoring extracts of 
any kind. 

SNOW EGGS , 

Beat the white of one egg to a stiff froth. Put a half 
pint of milk in a double boiler, drop the white by spoonfuls 
on the top of the hot milk, let them stand a moment, lift them 
with a skimmer and put them on a breakfast plate. Repeat 
until all the white has been cooked. Moisten a teaspoonful 
of arrowroot in cold milk, add it to the hot milk, cook until 
smooth, add two teaspoonfuls of sugar and the yolk of the 
egg, stir until hot, take from the fire, add a tablespoonful of 
sherry and stand aside to cool. When cold dish the white 
of the egg in a pyramid, pour around the custard, and they 
are ready to serve. 

EGG CORDIAL 

Separate an egg, beat the white to a stiff froth, add a 
teaspoonful of powdered sugar and beat again until fine and 
dry, stir in one tablespoonful of cream beaten to a stiff 
froth, and a tablespoonful of brandy. Turn into a glass 
and serve at once. 



278 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

GOLDEN NOG 

Beat the white of an egg until it is very, very stiff. 
Half fill a lemonade or punch glass with strained orange 
juice, float the beaten white on top, heaping it up daintily. 

Other fruit juices may be used in the same fashion, 
but orange, grape and apple are the most palatable. 

Excellent in cases of typhoid. 

EGGNOG 

Separate an egg; beat the white until light, add the 
yolk, beat again, add a tablespoonful of granulated sugar, 
beat for a moment and add three ounces of milk. Pour the 
mixture backward and forward from one tumbler to another 
and finally pour it into a perfectly clean tumbler, dust over 
a little grated nutmeg and use at once. 

FRENCH EGGNOG 

Beat the white of an egg until stiff, add the yolk and 
beat again. Pour over it hastily three ounces of scalding 
hot milk, pour from one tumbler to- another for a moment, 
and, if admissible, add a tablespoonful of whiskey or 
brandy; turn into a clean tumbler, dust lightly with nut- 
meg, and serve. 

EGG AND WHEY 

Separate an egg, beat the white until it is stiff, add the 
yolk and beat again ; add to this three ounces of rennet 
whey and a tablespoonful of good cream. Pour backward 
and forward from one tumbler to another for a moment, 
turn it into a clean tumbler, dust with a little nutmeg and 
serve. 

EGG PUNCH 

Separate an egg and beat the white until it is very stiff. 
Beat the yolk, pour into it two-thirds of a cupful of boiling 
water, beating all the while, add a tablespoonful of granu- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 279 

lated sugar and the white, and pour at once into a clean tum- 
bler. Serve plain or flavored with brandy, sherry, port or 
whiskey, according to orders. 

EGG AND SHERRY 

Put six tablespoonfuls of sherry into a small tumbler, 
and drop into it a small fresh egg. The egg must be swal- 
lowed whole. 

EGG AND MULLED WINE 

Put a half cupful of sherry or port into a saucepan; 
add a small piece of stick cinnamon and a clove, heat over 
hot water, and pour, while hot, into one well-beaten egg, 
strain, turn into a tumbler and serve at once. 

EGG LEMONADE 

Separate one egg, beat the white, then add the yolk 
and beat again ; dissolve a tablespoonful of sugar in a little 
cold water, add a half cupful of water and the juice of one 
lemon ; add this gradually to the beaten egg, strain into a 
tumbler and serve. Or put all the ingredients into a 
"shaker," shake well and strain. 

CAUDLE 

Make a cornmeal gruel from water and pour while hot 
over one egg well beaten ; add four tablespoonfuls of sherry, 
turn it into a clean tumbler and dust with grated nutmeg. 

This may be served either hot or cold. With a piece 
of zweibaek it makes an exceedingly good luncheon for 
a convalescing patient. 

HARD-BOILED EGG 

Put an egg into cold water, bring the water quickly to 
boiling point, remove the saucepan at once from the fire and 
allow it to stand covered on the table for thirty minutes. 



280 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

This will make the yolk mealy and dry, and will also soften 
the white; the white, however, is unfit for sick diet. 

When eggs are expensive, break the egg, reserve the 
white, raw, for another dish, drop the yolk in the shell down 
into boiling water, cover the kettle and stand it away from 
the fire for forty minutes. The yolk will be just as palatable, 
just as dry and mealy, and you will have the white for an- 
other dish. 

GOLDEN TOAST 

Cut the crust from a half-inch slice of bread, dry the 
bread in the oven, then toast it quickly until a golden brown, 
put it in a small vegetable dish or platter, pour over a half 
cupful of scalded milk to which you have added a saltspoon- 
ful of salt. Garnish the top of this with the hard-boiled 
yolk of one egg pressed through a sieve. Serve immediately. 

If fatty matter is called for, spread the bread with butter 
before pouring over the milk, or add to the milk after you 
take it from the fire a tablespoonful of thick cream. 



Hard boil one egg. Separate the white and the yolk, 
after it has been boiled, chop the white very fine or press 
it through a fine sieve, or put it through a vegetable press. 
Do the yolk the same. Keep them separate. Toast a 
square of bread. Put two level teaspoonfuls of butter and 
two of flour into a saucepan, mix, add eight tablespoonfuls 
of milk, stir over hot water until the sauce thickens, add a 
saltspoonful of salt and the whites of the eggs. Stir again, 
until hot ; heap this on toast, cover it all over with the yolk 
of the egg, dust very lightly with salt, and serve at once. 

A good supper for children, the aged or consumptives. 

EGYPTIAN EGGS 

Beat one egg just enough to mix the white and yolk; 
add two tablespoonfuls of water and one tablespoonful of 
plain cream or cocoanut cream, the latter to be preferred; 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 281 

stand the bowl in a pan of boiling water, and beat rapidly 
until the egg is slightly congealed; turn this into a pretty 
little dish; put at the ends two triangular pieces of well- 
made toast; dust lightly with salt, and serve. 

EGGS, JEFFERSON 

Select a smooth, round tomato; cut a slice from the 
stem end and carefully cut out the seeds and core ; put the 
tomato in a small granite or earthen dish, and then in the 
oven for about ten minutes, until thoroughly heated. Take 
from the oven, put in a half teaspoonful of butter, a dusting 
of salt, and then break in one fresh egg. Put this back in 
the oven until the egg is "set." Dust lightly with salt, 
dish neatly, and serve. 

EGGS, CARDOZE 

Bake a medium-size, shapely potato until thoroughly 
done. Cut a slice from the side, scoop out the flesh, leaving 
a wall a half inch thick. Mash the potato; add two table- 
spoonfuls of cream and beat until light. Break into the 
potato a fresh egg, and put it back into the oven until the 
egg is set. Then cover the entire top with the mashed 
potato, brush with cream, and brown quickly in the oven. 
Dish on a paper mat, stick a pretty sprig of parsley, at the 
side, and serve.

VEGETABLES 

Vegetables are divided into four classes : those rich in 
nitrogen muscle and tissue-building foods; those con- 
taining carbohydrates sugars and starch ; fatty vegetables 
nuts and olives; and succulent vegetables, containing 
little but water and mineral matter. 

In the first class we have old peas, beans and lentils, 
soy beans and the chick pea of the East. Starch is also 
found in goodly quantities in these vegetables. Cereals and 
cereal foods, as bread and Italian pastes, contain both 
nitrogen and starch. 

In the second class, carbohydrates, we have rice, pota- 
toes, yams, taro, cush-cush, cassava, tapioca and sago. 

In the third class, vegetables containing mineral mat- 
ter and water, are cabbage, carrots, turnips, spinach, cress, 
cymlins, cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, very young green 
peas, string beans, onions and christophines. 

Vegetables as a rule should be cooked in water, in an 
uncovered vessel. Rapid boiling frequently toughens the 
fibre of underground vegetables. Cooked at 210 Fahr. 
they become tender quickly, and retain their flavor and 
color. Rice and macaroni, however, should be boiled 
rapidly, not that the water is hotter, but the motion of 
rapidly-boiling water washes apart and separates the par- 
ticles. All starchy vegetables must be cooked at the boiling 
point. 

All vegetables must go over the fire in boiling water. 
To green vegetables add a teaspoonful of salt to each half 
gallon of water in which they are to be boiled. Under- 
ground vegetables, the roots and tubers of plants, are bet- 
ter cooked in unsalted water. For instance, turnips are 
white, sweet, palatable and easily digested if cut into 
blocks and cooked carefully in unsalted water. If boiled 
rapidly in salted water, they lose their color, flavor and 
digestibility, and are coarse and unpalatable. Raw cabbage 
with French dressing is digested by a person in health in 
two and a half hours ; boiled it takes five hours. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 283 

Dried vegetables, as peas, beans and lentils, must be 
cooked in soft water, if possible. The salts of lime in hard 
water coagulate the casein and render it dense and difficult 
of digestion. 

For the sick, all vegetables must be freshly gathered, 
otherwise do not use them. They should be thrown in cold 
water the moment they come from the market. Do not 
add salt to the water as it draws out the juices and hardens 
the fibre. 

For the convenience of persons who are on restricted 
diet, the vegetables in this book have been arranged in 
groups, so that their chemical constitutents may be seen at 
a glance.

Many lichens have been used as dyes, but very few as 
food. Arctic explorers have sometimes been forced to eat 
various plants of this group. The best known lichen, how- 
ever, is the Iceland moss.

valuable in intensifying the flavor of other vegetables. 
They must be used in small quantities, and never for the 
sick without a physician's orders. 

Tarragon, steeped in a small quantity of vinegar, fil- 
tered or strained, is used as a flavoring for salad dressings. 

Capers are used as a flavoring and garnish to chicken 
salad, and in a sauce for boiled mutton. 

There is but one of these materials that needs a special 
mention, and that is the gumbo file powder. This is made 
from the very young leaves of the sassafras tree (Sassafras 
officinale, Nees), picked during the middle of the day, 
dried quickly in the sun, rubbed in the hands until they are 
rather fine, and sifted through a fine sieve. Use as thick- 
ening to chicken or vegetable broth, or in gumbo soup. 
Allow a half teaspoonful to each pint of soup. The Creoles 
add gumbo file powder to chicken, oyster and crab soup.

Starchy vegetables belong to the carbohydrates, are

digestion of all starchy foods is in the mouth; thorough 
mastication aids the final digestion in the small intestines.

The portion of the potato plant used as food consti- 
tutes an enlarged or gorged underground stem, and is the 
storehouse for the nourishment of the young plant. Many 
varieties are grown in this country, which are all cooked 
more or less alike. For the sick, invalids and children, use 
only full-grow^! ripe potatoes; those very young or very 
old are apt to provoke indigestion. 

The water in which potatoes are boiled must be thrown 
away ; it is usually unsafe for food. 

Pare the potatoes very sparingly, as both nourishment 
and mineral matter are in greater proportion near the skin. 



288 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

As the flavor of potatoes is due to the mineral matter, 
they are more tasty when boiled in their "jackets." Care- 
fully-cooked potatoes make a good, easily-digested starchy 
food. The amount of nitrogen is small, but when served 
with the more nitrogenous foods, old peas, beans, nuts, 
meats, eggs and milk, help to make a balanced ration. 
Baked, boiled, mashed and rebaked, they are more easily 
digested than when cooked with fat. Fried foods are unfit 
for the well, and should never be used for invalids or chil- 
dren. 

TO BOIL POTATOES 

Take a thin paring from the potatoes, remove the eyes, 
throw them at once into cold water; when ready to cook, 
drop them into a kettle of boiling, unsalted water, boil 
rapidly ten miutes, and cook at the boiling point until the 
potatoes are very nearly done. Throw in a cup of cold 
water to cool the surface ; this will allow the center to cook 
just a moment longer and will make the potato more mealy. 
As soon as the water again reaches boiling point and the 
potato is tender to the center, drain it perfectly dry, dust 
it with a little salt, and shake it over the fire, holding the 
pot at least six inches from the stove. When dry and 
white like a snowball, dish it on a folded napkin or small 
doily and serve it at once. 

MASHED POTATOES 

Mash a well-boiled potato either with a silver fork or 
through a sieve; add two or three tablespoonfuls of hot 
milk, stand the bowl in a pan of hot water, and with a 
silver fork beat the potato until it is white and light. Dish 
it in a small heated dish and serve at once. Do not cover 
it, nor do not pat it down. 

RICE POTATO 

Press a well-beaten mashed potato through a vegetable 
press on to a heated dish; serve quickly. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 289 

POTATO PUFF 

Heap in rugged fashion a well-mashed potato in a 
small baking dish or individual casserole, touch it here and 
there with the beaten yolk of egg, then brush it over with 
the white of egg and bake in a quick oven until a golden 
brown. 

POTATO ROSES 

Put a mashed potato into an ordinary pastry bag, hold- 
ing a star tube ; press the potato into a baking pan, making 
good-sized roses; touch them lightly with beaten white of 
egg and run them into a hot oven until a golden brown. 
Arrange neatly on a small doily and serve. A sprig of 
parsley between the roses adds to the attractiveness of 
the dish. 

CREAMED POTATOES 

Chop a cold boiled potato rather fine. Put a teaspoon- 
ful of butter and a teaspoonful of flour into a saucepan, 
mix, add a half cupful of milk, stir until boiling, a.dd a 
quarter of a teaspoonful of salt and the potato. Turn this 
into an individual baking dish, dust lightly with fine bread 
crumbs and bake to a golden brown. 

POTATO TIMBALE 

Add a well-beaten yolk of an egg, a half teaspoonful 
of salt and one drop of Tabasco to a mashed potato. Line 
the bottom of a small timbale mold with greased paper, 
fill in the potato mixture, stand in a baking pan of boiling 
water and cook in the oven twenty minutes. When done, 
loosen the sides with a limber knife, turn the timbale out 
on a small heated dish, and garnish with very tender young 
peas. 

This is an exceedingly nice accompaniment to a broiled 
lamb chop, and makes an easily-digested meal for an in- 
valid or child.

290 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

POTATO SOUFFLE 

Stir the well-beaten white of one egg into a mashed 
potato; heap it into an individual casserole or ramekin dish 
and bake in the oven until a golden brown. 



POTATOES a la CREME 

Chop one cold boiled potato rather fine; add a grating 
of nutmeg and a saltspoonful of salt. Add a dash of 
Tabasco to four tablespoonfuls of cream ; add this to the 
potato, turn into an individual baking dish and bake in a 
quick oven fifteen minutes. 



BAKED POTATOES 

Select a perfectly sound, medium large potato; brush 
the potato thoroughly in cold water until the skin is clean, 
then rinse, and allow it to remain in cold water for at least 
a half hour. Then place it on the grate in a moderately 
hot oven and bake slowly until tender; this will take from 
three-quarters of an hour to an hour. When done, take 
the potato in a napkin in your hand and press it gently all 
over, without breaking the skin ; when it has been thor- 
oughly mashed to the very center, slash it one side in the 
form of a cross, stand it on a folded napkin and serve at 
once. 

A piece of butter may be put in the center of a baked 
potato, and one may add, if admissible, a drop of Tabasco. 
The potato is more easily digested, however, if eaten with 
just a little salt. 

Never stick a fork into a baking potato to see if it is 
done; this breaks the skin, allows the steam to escape and 
makes the potato soggy. 

Do not have the oven too hot; the skin becomes hard 
at once and prevents the evaporation of the water, which 
makes the potato wet and unpalatable. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 291 

POTATO PUREE 

Break a well-baked potato into halves and scoop out 
all the mealy portion ; add four tablespoonfuls of good cream 
and a saltspoonful of salt ; beat it quickly with a silver fork 
and serve on a heated plate. 

STUFFED POTATOES 

This is a nice way to serve a baked potato, both to 
children and invalids. The second baking makes it more 
easily digested. 

Cut a baked potato into halves, scoop out the center, 
mash it with a silver fork, add four or five tablespoonfuls 
of hot milk, a saltspoonful of salt, and if admissible a dash 
of Tabasco ; otherwise omit pepper. Beat until light, and 
fold in carefully the well-beaten white of one egg. Fill the 
"shells," but do not pat the mixture down to make it heavy. 
Brush the top lightly with milk, and bake in a moderate 
oven until a golden brown. Serve on a dainty paper doily 
or a folded linen napkin. 

POTATO BALLS 

Put a well-baked potato through a vegetable press, add 
the yolk of one egg and a palatable seasoning of salt. When 
well mixed, add two tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, form 
into balls the size of an English walnut, roll in milk, then 
in fine bread crumbs, stand on a baking sheet and bake in 
a quick oven until a golden brown. Heap like cannon 
balls on a folded napkin. 

These make a nice variety to an invalid's diet, and are 
also nice for children. 

RICE 

Rice is exceedingly rich in starch, and when unpolished 
contains also a considerable amount of protein. It is said 
that the varieties grown in East India contain more nitrogen 
than rice grown in the United States. 



292 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

In boiling, rice parts with a goodly quantity of both 
starch and mineral matter. For children, it should be thor- 
oughly washed and soaked in cold water, and steamed. 
The water in which rice has been boiled should be saved 
for soups or used as rice water. 

Rice containing four times as much nourishment as 
potatoes and when carefully cooketl in water requires only 
one hour for perfect digestion. If overcooked and soggy, it 
is apt to cause fermentation, the same as a badly-cooked 
potato. Well cooked, it furnishes energy food for nearly 
three-quarters of the world's inhabitants. 

The tables following will give the comparative analysis 
of cooked and uncooked rice

The rice-eating people of the world, those who use rice 
as a staple food, three times a day, do not add salt, as is the 
fashion among people of the United States ; they do not 
have the craving for salt that is found among potato-eating 
people. Where rice is the only form of starchy food, learn 
to eat it without salt. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 293 

TO BOIL RICE 
One Serving 

Wash four tablespoonfuls of rice through several cold 
waters. Put one quart of water in a saucepan, when 
boiling rapidly, sprinkle in the rice slowly ; do not stop the 
boiling, and boil rapidly, uncovered, for fifteen minutes. 
Drain the rice in a sieve, pour over quickly a half cup of 
cold water, stand the sieve on a plate at the oven door 
where it will dry. Turn it at once into a small vegetable 
dish and serve uncovered. 

To be well cooked and perfect, each grain must be 
swollen four times its original size, and no two grains must 
be sticking together. 

STEAMED RICE 

One Serving 

Wash four tablespoonfuls of rice through cold water, 
let it soak an hour, put it in a small sieve, stand over boil- 
ing water, cover and steam for thirty minutes. Turn into 
a heated dish and serve. 

RICE PUDDING 

Two Servings 

Put one tablespoonful of unwashed rice into one pint 
of milk, add a half tablespoonful of sugar ; when the sugar 
is dissolved turn it into a small baking dish and bake one 
hour, stirring down the crust every ten minutes. 

To be absolutely correct, this pudding must be like 
thick cream not stiff enough to require a sauce. Serve 
warm or cold. 

RICE a 1'IMPERATRICE 
One Serving 

Pare and stone one peach, put it in a baking dish, dust 
it lightly with sugar and stand it in the oven until perfectly 
soft. Have ready boiled three tablespoonfuls of rice, put 
the peach on top, dust it with powdered sugar and serve 
with plain cream. 



MRS. RORER S DIET FOR THE SICK 

RICE MERINGUE 

One Serving 

Wash one tablespoonful of rice through several cold 
waters, throw it into boiling water, boil rapidly ten min- 
utes and drain. Add a half cupful of cold milk, and the 
yolk of an egg beaten with a half tablespoonful of sugar; 
pour this into a small baking dish and bake in a moderate 
oven fifteen minutes. Beat the white of an egg until stiff, 
add a level tablespoonful of powdered sugar, and beat until 
fine and dry; heap this over the top of the pudding, dust 
with powdered sugar, and brown lightly in the oven. 

RICE DUMPLING 
One Serving 

Wash four tablespoonfuls of rice through several cold 
waters; soak a half hour or longer, drain, throw it into 
boiling water, boil rapidly ten minutes and drain again ; 
spread this in the center of a square of cheesecloth. Pare 
and stone one small mellow peach, put half of the peach 
in the center of the rice, fill the core space with boiled rice, 
put on the other half, and gather the cloth up so there will 
be a thin layer of rice over the peach ; it must be entirely 
covered. Tie the "dumpling" tightly, throw it into a kettle 
of boiling water and boil twenty minutes. 

To serve, cut the string, remove the cloth and turn 
the dumpling carefully into a dessert plate. Serve with 
cold milk or cream, or a puree of peaches. 

EGYPTIAN RICE 

Two Servings 

Cover a half tablespoonful of granulated gelatin with 
a half cup of cold milk, let it soak thirty minutes; add a 
tablespoonful of powdered sugar and stir it over the fire 
until the gelatin is dissolved. Add two tablespoonfuls of 
carefully-boiled rice and two scalded dates, chopped fine ; 
when this begins to solidify, fold in six tablespoonfuls of 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 295 

cream whipped to a stiff froth ; turn into two individual 
molds and stand aside until perfectly cold. Serve plain 
or with cream. ( 

RICE CREAM 

One Serving 

Press two tablespoonfuls of boiled rice through a fine 
sieve, add to it the yolk of one egg beaten with a tablespoon- 
ful of sugar and a half cup of milk. Stir over the fire just a 
minute, take from the fire and stir in, while hot, the well- 
beaten white of the egg. Turn into a pretty dessert glass, 
dust with powdered sugar and stand aside to cool. 

HOMINY 

We have two kinds of hominy in our markets, one 
made from almost the entire grain of white dry corn, with 
the hull taken off, sold under the name of hominy and samp ; 
and the other, hominy grits. Hominy grits, well cooked, 
makes an excellent breakfast food for children, the aged 
and invalids ; it should be soaked over night in cold milk 
or water, and cooked slowly for a long while. 

The large hominy, when well cooked, gives variety to 
a diet in chronic rheumatism. It must be thoroughly cooked 
and well masticated. 

TO COOK HOMINY GRITS 

Wash four tablespoonfuls of hominy grits through sev- 
eral cold waters ; add one cupful of milk and a saltspoonful 
of salt, and stand it in a cold place over night. Next morn- 
ing turn it into the upper part of a double boiler, stir until 
the water reaches the boiling point, cover the boiler and 
cook thirty minutes, or better one hour. Serve with milk 
or cream, as ordered. 

HOMINY JELLY 

Wash two tablespoonfuls of hominy grits through 
several cold waters, then stir it into a half pint of boiling 



296 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

water, add a saltspoonful of salt, and boil rapidly, stirring 
all the while, for five minutes. Then cook it in a double 
boiler until it is thick and rather transparent. Turn this 
into individual molds and stand aside to cool. 

This should be transparent and not too stiff. 

Serve with cream. 

YAMS (Dioscorea Batatas) 

Yams are imported into the United States from the 
Wesf Indies and Central America. They are exceedingly 
large, frequently weighing from four to ten pounds. They 
do not grow in the United States. The so-called yam of the 
southern States is simply a large variety of a sweet potato. 
The large yam, dioscorea alata, to be thoroughly digestible, 
must be baked for a long time. When well baked and soft 
to the center, they are the most delicious of all starchy foods. 

Scrub the outside with a brush, rinse in cold water, 
put it in a moderate oven and bake slowly until tender 
a yam weighing one pound, an hour; two pounds, an hour 
and a half. 

TARO (Colocasia antiquorum, Schott, Variety esculenta) 
Root of the Elephant Ear 

Taro is made by the Hawaiians into a dish called poi, 
and in the West Indies and Central America the root is 
boiled and served much the same as we serve potatoes. It 
constitutes a good starchy food easy of digestion. Prepara- 
tions of ground dried taro can be purchased in this country 
under the name of Taroena. As it contains a ferment that 
is supposed to aid in the digestion of albuminoids, it forms an 
important starchy food for the sick. With milk, or even 
served with broiled meat, it taxes the digestive powers very 
lightly. In porridge it can be taken by people with acute 
indigestion without the slightest distress. Taroena is made 
from the toasted or cooked root, so that it may be stirred 
into hot milk without further cooking. It may also be used 
in egg custard in the place of cornstarch or arrowroot. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 297 

CASSAVA AND TAPIOCA 

Both cassava and tapioca are very rich in starch, con- 
taining from eighty-five to ninety per cent. They are 
made from the fleshy roots of two species of the tropical 
genus Manihot; one the "bitter," and the other the "sweet" 
cassava. The bitter cassava, when robbed by heat of its 
poisonous qualities, makes cassava flour and tapioca. 

In sick diet we are only concerned with tapioca in the 
fine granular form. Larger pieces require long soaking and 
careful cooking to be digestible. Pearled tapioca (tapioca 
made into small round grains the size of a pea) may be 
added to soup for the well, but for the sick fine granulated 
tapioca alone should be used. 

Tapioca may be made into custard or fruit desserts, or 
added to soups. Recipes for the uses of tapioca will be 
found among the desserts in another part of the book. 

SAGO 

First-class sago is almost a pure starch made from the 
central part of several varieties of palms. East Indian sago 
meal, made from the Cycas, must not be confounded with 
our ordinary commercial sago. Recipes for cooking sago 
will be found among the desserts. 

ARROWROOT 

Genuine arrowroot, made from the stalk of the Maranta 
Arundinacea, is the most easily-digested of all starches. 
The starch cells of arrowroot are ruptured at a temperature 
of 180 Fahr. It is the smallest of all starch granules. 
Under the microscope it resembles closely, with the excep- 
tion of size, potato starch, which looks like a tiny oyster 
shell. Much of the arrowroot sold in this market is adul- 
terated with potato and cassava flour or other inferior 
starches. Adulteration, however, can be easily detected' by 
microscopic observations. 



298 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

TOUS-LES-MOIS 

This is a starch made from the tuber of the Canna 
edulis, and like arrowroot, is very easy of digestiori. These 
are the largest of the starch grains, are round with con- 
centric markings and a central hilum. This starch is not 
used to any extent in the United States except for the 
making of Turkish Delight, a sort of jelly-like, elastic 
candy. It is, however, a valuable starch in cases of rheu- 
matism or chronic constipation. It may be used precisely 
the same as arrowroot, made into jelly or gruel, with milk 
or water. I have also used it with good results in gastric 
troubles. 

TOUS-LES-MOIS PANADA 

Put a half pint of milk into a double boiler, add a 
tablespoonful of granulated sugar and twenty-four almonds 
that have been blanched and ground; when this is hot add 
one teaspoonful of Tous-les-Mois moistened in two table- 
spoonfuls of cold milk. Stir until the mixture begins to 
thicken, cover the boiler and cook ten minutes. Serve 
warm, plain, or with a little thin cream. 

For dyspeptics, where there is too little hydrochloric 
acid, serve without cream and sugar ; add a little salt. 

ITALIAN PASTES 

Macaroni, spaghetti, vermicelli and noodles are gener- 
ally known as Italian pastes. Most of them are quite un- 
suited for diet for the sick, although they make an agreeable 
starchy food for children, invalids and the aged. They must 
not however, be served baked with cheese ; if cheese is 
added it must be freshly-grated Parmesan, put on after the 
macaroni is taken from the fire. 

No matter what the final preparation is to be, the first 
cooking is always the same. Partly fill a large kettle with 
rapidly boiling salted water; throw in the macaroni or 
spaghetti, allow it to boil rapidly for thirty minutes, then 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 299 

drain and throw it into cold water, changing- the water 
until it is perfectly cold. Allow it to stand for thirty min- 
utes more, drain and it is ready to dress. 

TO HEAT IN CREAM SAUCE 

Make an ordinary cream sauce, add the spaghetti or 
macaroni, stand it over hot water until thoroughly heated, 
and serve, passing with it grated Parmesan. 

BREAKFAST SPAGHETTI 

Boil the night before the desired quantity of spaghetti, 
throw it into cold water and let it stand in a cold place 
over night. Next morning drain, cover it with boiling stock, 
simmer gently fifteen minutes, add a half saltspoonful of 
salt, take from the fire, add a teaspoonful of butter cut into 
bits, and serve on a heated dish. 

This may be used in the place of a cereal. 

BAKED MACARONI 

Boil the macaroni as directed, put it into cream sauce, 
turn into an individual casserole or ramekin dish and bake 
in a moderately hot oven until slightly browned. 

SPAGHETTI, ITALIAN FASHION 

This can hardly be called a dish for the sick, but in 
cases of long invalid feeding where tomatoes are admissible, 
this dish is always palatable and appetizing. 

Boil spaghetti as directed. Put a quarter of a pound 
of meat through the meat grinder, then into a saucepan 
with a half pint of strained tomato, a teaspoonful of onion 
juice and a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt; cook and stir 
until boiling hot, push to the back of the stove and cook, 
covered, for fifteen minutes. Strain, pressing as much of 
the meat through the sieve as possible. Drain the spaghetti, 
add it to this sauce, heat carefully over hot water, turn 



300 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

into a heated serving dish, dust thickly with grated Par- 
mesan and send to the table. 
If onion disagrees, omit it. 

NOODLES 

Put a cupful of flour in a large dinner plate or platter, 
make a well in the center, add a saltspoonful of salt and 
one egg beaten with two tablespoonfuls of water; work the 
flour into the egg mixture a little at a time ; the dough must 
be exceedingly hard. Knead and pound until it is elastic 
and then roll it in two sheets as thin as tissue paper. Put 
a clean towel or old tablecloth over a table, put the sheets 
on this and allow them to dry for an hour and a half or two 
hours; they must not be brittle. Then roll them up as 
tightly as possible, and with a sharp knife shave the noodles 
from the ends. Shake them out and allow them to dry. 
They may be made one day to use the next, and if perfectly 
dried will keep for several days. 

Boil these in chicken stock or in beef stock; or they 
may be cooked in water and served with butter or cream. 

NOODLES, WITH COTTAGE CHEESE 

This dish makes nice variety for chronic rheumatic 
patients. 

After the noodles are boiled until tender, about twenty 
minutes, in stock or water, drain them perfectly dry, dust 
them lightly with salt, add two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
mix carefully without breaking, turn them on a hot platter, 
put over here and there little balls of homemade cottage 
cheese and send to the table.

A GROUP OF STARCHY VEGETABLES, 
ALSO CONTAINING SUGAR 

Sweet Potatoes; Squash; Pumpkin. 

SWEET POTATO (Ipomsea Batatas, Lamarck) 

The sweet potato belongs to the morning glory family. 
In this country we have three or four varieties, containing 
more or less starch, and more or less sugar. The large so- 
called "yam" of the South (which, by the way, is no rela- 
tion to the yam) is rich in sugar, and unless carefully 
cooked becomes rather pasty and is not a suitable diet for 
the sick. The smaller red sweet potatoes contain a consid- 
erable amount of gum and dextrin. According to Church, 
the composition of an ordinary Central American sweet 
potato is as follows : 

Water 75.0 

Albuminoids, etc 1.5 

Starch 15.0 

Sugar 1.7 

Dextrin, and gum 2.2 

Pectose 0.9 

Fat 0.4 

Cellulose 1.8 

Mineral matter 1.5 

BAKED SWEET POTATO 

If sweet potatoes are to be served to invalids, or even 
given to children, they should be carefully baked in the 
skins. 

Wash them well, put them into a moderate oven and 
bake until they are soft in the center. Serve at once. 

TWICE BAKED SWEET POTATOES 

After the potato has been baked according to preceding 
recipe, break it into halves, scoop out the flesh, add to it a 
tablespoonful of cream and a palatable seasoning of salt. 



302 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Heap it into a baking dish, brush with milk and bake in a 
hot oven until a golden brown. 

WINTER SQUASH (Cucurbita maxima, Duchesne) 

The following rules for cooking pumpkin may be used 
for any variety of winter squash, as the Cashaw or Hubbard. 
While they do not contain as much nourishment as rice or 
potatoes, they give variety to the daily diet. 

Saw from the squash a piece, the required size, remove 
the seeds and bake at least one hour, or until perfectly 
tender. Serve in the shell, or it may be scooped out and 
mashed with a little butter. 

This is exceedingly nice served with stewed or panned 
chicken. 

Keep the remaining portion in a cold place to use as 
wanted. 

COMMON PUMPKIN (Cucurbita Pepo, Linn.) 

This makes an exceedingly nice vegetable to take the 
place of sweet or white potatoes. 

BOILED PUMPKIN 

Cut a sufficient amount from the pumpkin, pare it, re- 
move the seeds and cut it into blocks, put them in a sieve, 
stand the sieve in a saucepan, the bottom of which is cov- 
ered with water; cover the saucepan and cook until the 
pumpkin is tender. Lift the sieve, drain and press the 
pumpkin through, add a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoon- 
ful of butter or a tablespoonful of cream. Heap on a heated 
dish and serve at once. 

PUMPKIN TIMBALE 

One Serving 

Steam sufficient pumpkin to make half a cupful, add 
a saltspoonful of salt, a half teaspoonful of butter and one 
egg, well beaten; put it in a custard cup and stand it in a 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 303 

pan of boiling water and bake in a quick oven about twenty 
minutes, until the timbale is "set." When done, carefully 
turn it from the cup and serve at once. 

This is a nice accompaniment to roasted or panned 
chicken. 

PUMPKIN CUSTARD 
One Serving 

Steam sufficient pumpkin to make a half cupful of 
mashed pumpkin ; add two teaspoonfuls of sugar, a tea- 
spoonful of butter and just a pinch of salt; mix. Moisten 
a level tablespoonful of flour gradually with a half cupful 
of milk ; when perfectly smooth add it to the pumpkin ; add 
a teaspoonful of brandy and a grating of nutmeg. Turn 
into a custard cup and bake as you would a cup custard. 
Serve in the cup in which it is baked.

A GROUP OF SUCCULENT VEGETABLES 

CONTAINING A LITTLE STARCH 

AND SUGAR 

Salsify; Parsnips; String Beans 

I have placed string beans in this group because at times 
they do contain a minimum amount of starch ; this amount, 
however, depends on the maturity of the bean and the hour 
of the day in which they are picked. Just before sundown 
they contain but little starch ; early in the morning, how- 
ever, they would of course contain more. 

Salsify and parsnips contain about an equal amount 
of starch and sugar, not, enough however to take the place 
of either rice or potato, but quite enough to make them 
objectionable to diabetic persons. 

SALSIFY (Tragopogon porrifolius, Linn.) 

This is sold in the market under the name of oyster 
plant, and makes one of the nicest of cream soups for chil- 
dren's luncheon or supper. There is no objection to adding 
oyster plant to the diet for the aged or invalids. A recipe 
for the soup will be found among the cream soups. 

SALSIFY WITH CREAM SAUCE 

Scrape one dozen salsify roots and throw them at once 
into cold water to prevent discoloration. At cooking time 
cut them into very thin slices, cover with boiling water and 
cook until tender, about forty minutes ; drain, dish and 
cover with cream sauce. 

PARSNIPS 

Parsnip is the root of the Pastinaca sativa, Linn. It is 
very rich in woody fibre, which prohibits its use in diet 
for the sick. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 305 

STRING BEANS (Haricots Verts') 

String beans are not rich in nourishment, but furnish 
an exceedingly good bulky food in cases of chronic consti- 
pation. Boiled and served cold as a salad they are palat- 
able, attractive, and wholesome. 

TO BOIL STRING BEANS 

String the beans and cut them in three pieces length- 
wise ; soak them in cold water for one hour, put them in a 
quantity of boiling water, boil fifteen minutes and drain. 
Cover with fresh boiling water, add salt and cook slowly 
until tender, three-quarters of an hour, drain, and if they 
are to be served hot add a little salt and butter or cream ; 
if to be used for salad, put at once to cool. 



306 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



A GROUP OF VEGETABLES CONTAINING 
SUGAR AND NO STARCH OR NITROGEN 

Young Green Peas ; Young Green Corn ; Beets 

YOUNG GREEN PEAS 

These are very rich in water, and- contain sugar and 
a little mineral matter. They take no part whatever in 
body building. They are palatable and easy of digestion, 
and for this reason make a nice addition to the food of an 
invalid or child; even young children may eat fresh green 
peas if they are carefully boiled and pressed through a sieve. 

TO COOK GREEN PEAS 

The sweetness and flavor of green vegetables depend 
entirely on careful cooking. 

Shell the peas, throw them into cold water for twenty 
minutes, and drain. Put a leaf of lettuce, if you have it, 
in the bottom of a saucepan, and add just enough water to 
keep the peas from scorching. Add to the water a half tea- 
spoonful of salt, put in the peas, cover the kettle and cook 
about twenty minutes, or until the peas are tender. Very 
young peas will cook in ten minutes. When done, drain ; 
if properly cooked, the kettle will be almost dry. To each 
half pint of peas add a teaspoonful of butter and a half 
teaspoonful of sugar, or you may add cream in the place 
of butter. Serve at once. 

For people who are inclined to indigestion the peas 
should be pressed through a sieve, reheated over hot water 
and served quickly. 

TO COOK CANNED PEAS 

Turn the peas from the can into a sieve, wash them 
under the cold water spigot ; reheat, season and serve- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 307 

BOILED PEAS IN TURNIP CUPS 

To give variety peas may be served in bread patties 
o'r turnip cups. 

Select a small white turnip, pare it carefully, cut off 
the stem end, scoop out the center, throw it into unsalted 
water and cook slowly until white and transparent. Drain, 
stand it on a paper doily in a dish and fill it with nicely 
cooked peas ; put a sprig of parsley at the bottom and it 
is ready to serve. 

YOUNG SWEET CORN 

i 

Young sweet corn should be freshly picked, husked 
and thrown into boiling water. It should not boil over two 
minutes, and should be served at once. To eat, score down 
the center of each row of grains and press out the pulp. Corn 
does not, however, play a large part in diet for the sick. 

CORN BOILED IN THE HUSKS 

In cases of continued feeding where one's brain is con- 
stantly racked for variety, this makes a pretty vegetable. 

Open carefully at the top, remove every particle of 
silk, strip off the heavy husks from the outside, leaving the 
cob covered with about two layers of the young light 
husks ; cut the end of the husks even. Have ready a kettle 
of boiling water, put in the corn, and after the water begins 
to boil, boil five minutes ; lift with a skimmer and place it 
on a folded napkin ; do not remove the husks. 

To eat, pull down the husks, score each row of grains 
through the center, spread the corn lightly with butter, 
dust with salt, and with the teeth press out the center of 
the grains, leaving the hulls on the cob. Fresh, carefully- 
cooked corn, eaten in this way will rarely ever produce 
indigestion. 



308 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

TO STEW CORN 

Score down the center of the grains and press out the 
pulp ; put this in a small bowl, stand the bowl in a sauce- 
pan of boiling water, cover and cook ten minutes. Add a 
little salt and butter, and serve. 

BEETS (Beta vulgaris, Linn.) 

The ordinary beet root contains a considerable amount 
of sugar. When young and tender it is palatable, but 
rather indigestible, hence it plays no part in diet for the 
sick. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 309 



THE LEGUMINOS^S 

A Group of Vegetables Containing a Goodly 
Quantity of Nitrogen and Starch 

Full-grown Dried Peas. Full-grown Dried Beans of all Varieties. 
Lentils. Chicle Peas. Soy Beans. Peanuts 

As flesh formers, muscle and tissue-building foods, 
these seeds far excel meats and cereals. The amount of 
nitrogen in dried beans is almost double that of mature 
wheat. The protein in these foods is digested and absorbed 
at a slower rate than the protein of meats, eggs and milk. 
Flour made from these vegetables, when thoroughly cooked 
and served in puree, is a most valuable food for nursing 
mothers, and with eggs and milk these purees should take 
the place of meat to a large extent in the diet for children. 
The vegetables themselves, to be easy of digestion, must be 
thoroughly cooked. They are rich in fatty matter and pro- 
tein as compared to other vegetables, which makes the addi- 
tion of fat pork to beans quite necessary. 

PUREE OF DRIED PEAS 

Wash thoroughly a half pint of dried peas, and soak 
them over night in cold water. Next morning drain, cover 
with cold water, bring to boiling point, throw this water 
away, cover with a quart of fresh boiling water, add ten 
grains of bicarbonate of soda and cook gently until the 
peas are tender, about one and a half hours. Press through 
a colander, this time using the water in which they were 
cooked. Return the puree to the kettle, add sufficient milk 
to make it the proper consistency, and stir in one level 
tablespoonful of flour mixed with a little cold milk; boil 
gently thirty minutes, add a palatable seasoning of salt, 



310 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

take from the fire and add four tablespoonfuls of cream 
or one tafolespoonful of butter. . 

Enough beans may be prepared and cooked one day 
to last for three or four days in cold weather, or the same 
length of time in summer if kept in a refrigerator. 

IN PLACE OF MEAT FOR CHILDREN 

Boil the peas as directed in preceding recipe. Press 
them through a colander, add a half teaspoonful of salt 
and two tablespoonfuls of cream or one of butter; heap 
into a baking dish and bake slowly in a moderate oven for 
about one hour. 

PUREE OF DRIED BEANS 

Recipes given for peas may always be used for beans, 
simply substituting navy beans for dried peas. 
These recipes will also answer for split peas. 

PUREE OF LENTILS 

Wash a half pint of lentils through several cold waters, 
cover with cold water and soak over night. In the morning 
drain, cover with fresh cold water, bring to a boil and drain 
again ; now add a pint and a half of water, stock or chicken 
broth. Cook the lentils until they are perfectly tender, press 
through a sieve, return the puree to the saucepan and add 
sufficient stock or milk to make the consistency of thin 
cream. Moisten two teaspoonfuls of cornstarch in a little 
cold milk, add it to the puree, boil five minutes, add a half 
teaspoonful of celery salt or a little crushed celery seed; 
take from the fire and add four tablespoonfuls of cream 
or one tablespoonful of butter. 

This is a most concentrated nitrogenous food; a good 
meat substitute for children and the aged ; and is especially 
good for nursing mothers. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 311 

QUICK LENTIL SOUP 

Stir one teaspoonful of lentil powder into a half pint of 
boiling water, cook slowly thirty minutes, add a little 
celery salt, taken from the fire and add a tablespoonful or 
two of cream or a little butter. 

This, like the preceding soup, makes an excellent noon- 
day meal for a child. 

BEAN SOUFFLE 

Wash and soak a half pint of beans over night. Next 
morning bring to a boil, drain, throw the water away, 
cover with fresh boiling water, add a level saltspoonful of 
bicarbonate of soda and cook slowly until the beans are 
very tender. Drain, throw the water away, and press the 
beans through a colander; add a half teaspoonful of celery 
salt, a tablespoonful of butter and four tablespoonfuls of 
hot milk; beat until light. Divide this, and put one-half 
away to use for another meal. Fold the well-beaten white 
of one egg into the remaining half, put it in an individual 
casserole or ramekin dish and bake in a moderate oven 
twenty minutes. 

This dish has meat value. 

YOUNG LIMA BEANS 

Cover the beans with boiling water, boil ten minutes 
and drain. Throw them out on a meat platter and skin 
them as you would slip an almond out of its skin after it has 
been scalded; throw the skins away. Put the beans into 
a saucepan, add sufficient boiling water to cover, and cook 
slowly until tender, about twenty minutes; drain, add two 
tablespoonfuls of milk, a teaspoonful of butter and a pal- 
atable seasoning of salt. 

These may be served to invalids, children and the 
aged. 



312 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

LIMA BEAN SOUFFLE 

Cook according to the preceding recipe and press 
through a fine sieve. Add the well-beaten white of one egg 
to each half cupful of beans, and bake in a small dish, in a 
moderate oven, twenty minutes. 

THE SOY BEAN (Glycine hispida, Maxine) 

The soy bean has for years formed the staple nitroge- 
nous diet of the people of the Orient ; in fact, a handful of 
rice and a few soy beans constitute the daily food of two- 
thirds of the East Indians, Chinese and Japanese. 

As these beans contain less starch than ordinary beans, 
they can be used in mild diabetic cases. 

To cook: Soak the given quantity over night, throw 
away the water, cover them with fresh cold water, bring 
to a boil, throw this water away, cook in fresh boiling water 
until tender, and press through a sieve. This is soy pulp. 

A preparation of soy flour may be purchased in cartons, 
but as I know nothing whatever about the quality of the 
flour, I prefer to use the pulp from beans boiled and pressed 
through a sieve. The flour saves time and trouble, but in 
feeding the sick this is of secondary consideration. 

SOY BEAN ROLLS 

After the beans have been drained and pressed through 
a colander, season them with butter and salt, form into rolls 
about three inches long, twice the size of your finger; stand 
them on oiled paper, brush with milk and brown in a quick 
oven. Serve with Cream Sauce Number Two. 

One roll is sufficient for the "meat" portion of a meal. 

SOY GEMS 

Separate two eggs, beat the yolks until light, add a 
half cupful of milk, a saltspoonful of salt, a half cupful of 
the soy pulp. Beat, add a teaspoonful of baking powder and 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 313 

fold in the well-beaten whites of the eggs ; turn at once into 
greased gem pans and bake in a quick oven. They should 
be eaten like spoon bread, with a fork. If gems are left over, 
pull them into halves and toast carefully to a golden brown. 

I find these muffins or gems one of the most valuable 
bread substitutes for diabetic patients. Two gems, with 
a lettuce salad with French dressing made from lemon 
juice, make a nice luncheon or supper. 

Do not add shortening in the form of butter or oil to 
the gems, as it makes them more difficult of digestion. 

SOY BEAN WAFERS 

Put a half cupful of the soy bean pulp into a bowl, add 
a half teaspoonful of salt, twenty-four blanched almonds 
ground fine, and one egg well beaten. Drop by tablespoon- 
fuls on greased paper and bake until crisp and brown. 
Masticate thoroughly. 

SOY BREAKFAST CAKES 

Put a half cupful of soy pulp into a bowl, add a half 
teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of milk, and fold 
in the well-beaten yolks of two eggs. Drop by tablespoon- 
fuls in greased pans and bake in a quick oven fifteen minutes. 
To eat, split with 'a fork and put on a little butter. 

Soy breads of various kinds may be given to diabetic 
patients once a day, unless they produce undesirable results.

A GROUP OF VEGETABLES CONTAINING 

NITROGENOUS MATTER WITHOUT 

STARCH OR SUGAR 

Under this heading we place all the edible fungi, mush- 
rooms and truffles. While they are rich in nitrogenous 
matter and are free from starch and sugar, they contain 
a large proportion of vegetable fibre, which makes them 
dense and difficult of digestion. They are food adjuncts or 
flavoring, rather than true foods. 

They will not, in any way, take the place of meat. The 
nitrogen they contain is not available for tissue building. 
They take no part whatever in diet for the sick. Now and 
then one may be chopped fine and added to a meat dish 
for the sake of variety in cases of long-continued restricted 
diet, and even then I should prefer not to use them. 

The coprinus micaceus, the early spring mushroom, is 
said to be very easy of digestion. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 315 

A GROUP OF GREEN OR SUCCULENT 
VEGETABLES 

This large group of vegetables contains principally 
water and mineral salts. 



Artichokes / * l * m Gherkin 

( Globe Horseradish 

Asparagus Kale 

Broccoli Kohl-rabi 

Brussels sprouts Martynia 



/-i v ( White Okra 

Cabbage ) .

Dock shoots Tomatoes 

Egg plant Vegetable marrow 

They include many parts of plants, as shoots, leaves, 
stalks, stems and roots. They are valuable articles of food, 
not because they contain nourishment, but for the mineral 
salts and waste material they give to the daily bill of fare, 
They are the most important foods in cases of chronic 
constipation; if well cooked and used daily, they will cure 
even obstinate cases. They are far more valuable than 
fruits, unless fruits are eaten alone. 

The object of cooking non-starchy vegetables, is to 
soften the fibre and make them more easy of digestion. 
Green vegetables unless carefully cooked, easily part with 
their salts in cooking, and become unsightly, unpalatable 
and useless as food. 

All green vegetables should be soaked before cooking 
in cold water without salt; salt wilts them. The common 



316 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

turnip, an admirable succulent vegetable, sightly, palatable 
and appetizing if daintily cooked, is nine out of ten times 
ruined in the cooking. Raw cabbage, finely shaved and 
soaked in cold water, is digested in two and a half hours; 
after it passes through the hands of the average cook it 
requires five hours for digestion. When stewed carefully 
requires but three hours. 

The water in Which vegetables are cooked is rich in 
salts and mineral matter; if thrown away the best part of 
the vegetable is lost. 

Green vegetables lend themselves most easily to the 
combination of milk for making cream soups ; the milk 
contains the needed nourishment, and is made palatable 
by the flavoring of the vegetables. These soups form an 
admirable luncheon or supper dish for children. 

Among the best cream soups are potato, pea, celery 
and cream of corn. 

In cases of chronic constipation, onions, carrots, stewed 
cucumbers, spinach and kale are best. 

GLOBE OR FRENCH ARTICHOKES 
(Cynara Scolymus, Linn.) 

The fleshy part of the scales and the part known as the 
"choke," to which the scales are attached, constitute the 
edible portion. 

TO BOIL ARTICHOKES 

Strip off the outside leaves and trim the base. With a 
sharp knife cut the tops of the leaves within two inches of 
the base. With the handle of a spoon scoop out the flowery 
portion in the center. Tie the artichokes into compact 
form with a strong string, throw them into a kettle of 
boiling water, add a teaspoonful of salt to each quart, and 
if you have it, a bit of charcoal, or powdered charcoal tied in 
a piece of cheesecloth. Boil five minutes, reduce the heat 
of the water and cook slowly just below the boiling point 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 317 

for one hour, or until the leaves are tender. Lift the arti- 
chokes carefully with a skimmer and turn them upside 
down to drain. 

To serve, put a small doily in a round plate, stand the 
artichoke on the doily, and pass with it a tiny boat of sauce 
Hollandaise. To eat, strip off the outside leaves, dip them 
in the sauce, and with the teeth strip off the fleshy part. 
There is little to eat on an artichoke, but they are appetiz- 
ing and attractive. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 
(Helianthus tuberosus, Linn.) 

These are the tubers of the so-called Italian sunflower, 
which grows wild and abundantly in many parts of the 
United States and Canada. They do not contain starch, 
and only a trace of sugar; are fairly rich in gum and inulin. 

Simply cooked, they may be eaten by diabetics. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES WITH CREAM 

Scrape the artichokes and throw them into cold water 
to prevent discoloration. When ready to cook, cut them 
into slices a half inch thick, cover with boiling water and 
cook gently twenty minutes, or until they can be easily 
pierced with a fork. Drain, turn into a heated dish and 
cover with hot cream, or add butter and salt; do not salt 
them while cooking. 

If properly cooked they will be sightly and crisp, not 
heavy or soggy. 

ASPARAGUS (Asparagus officinalis, Linn.) 

Asparagus belongs to the lily family. The plant is 
cultivated for its early shoots, which are in great favor in 
the United States, both as a vegetable, and hot and cold in 
salads. 

Asparagus contains an alkaloid known as asparagin. Its 
true merits or demerits are little known, hence it has very 



318 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

little place in diet for the sick. It may however, be used 
for the obese and the diabetic. 

The green asparagus is said to contain a greater amount 
of this active principle, asparagin, than the white, and should 
not be used in diet for the sick. 

In early spring the fresh young fronds of the fern 
and the shoots of the poke make good imitations of aspar- 
agus, and are frequently less injurious. Stale asparagus is 
as dangerous as stale meat. 

TO BOIL ASPARAGUS 

Peel the butt ends of each stalk of asparagus ; tie the 
stalks into small bundles, put them in a kettle sufficiently 
large to keep them straight, add a teaspoonful of salt and 
boil thirty minutes. Lift the asparagus, drain it on a soft 
cheesecloth and it is ready to serve. 

To serve hot put it on toast, with cream sauce or 
serve without toast with sauce Hollandaise. Cold, serve 
with French dressing, The tips of the stalks may be cut 
off and served in an individual dish with sauce Hollandaise. 
Or put them in a little bread patty and add two or three 
tablespoonfuls of carefully-made cream sauce. 



Under cabbage we will consider all varieties of the 
single species (Brassica oleracea, Linn.), a plant belonging 
to the mustard family. All these plants contain a volatile 
oil, rich in hydrogen and sulphur. It is thought by many 
that these elements help in the digestion of cabbage, which 
makes raw cabbage more easily digested than cooked cab- 
bage. Careless cooking drives off the gases, makes an un- 
pleasant and peculiar odor over the house and robs the cab- 
bage of its palatibility. Carefully-stewed cabbage is deli- 
cate, easily digested, palatable and sightly. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 319 

TO SERVE CABBAGE RAW 

Select a perfectly hard white head of cabbage, cut it 
into halves and shave off a sufficient quantity ; the cabbage 
must be as fine as thread. This can be done with a sharp 
knife or an ordinary "slaw cutter." Throw the cabbage 
into cold water, let it stand fifteen or twenty minutes, then 
press it dry; cover with fresh cold water, and if possible 
add a piece of ice; let this soak at least two hours, drain 
and put it in a towel to dry. Serve with French dressing. 

This is exceedingly good in cases of chronic constipa- 
tion, and can also be eaten by diabetic patients. 

LADIES' CABBAGE 

Cut the cabbage and treat it as directed in preceding 
recipe. Drain it, throw it into a kettle of boiling salted 
water, bring to boiling point and cook rapidly, uncovered, 
for twenty minutes. Drain again, and add salt, butter 
or cream. 

GERMAN CABBAGE 

Cook according to the preceding recipe, and instead of 
adding cream add two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice or 
vinegar and a little butter. 

CABBAGE ROLLS 

Take the loose leaves from a head of cabbage, or use 
a head of savoy. Scald the leaves just enough to make 
them soft. Have ready sufficient cold cooked chicken to 
make a half cupful ; season it with salt, a little chopped 
celery if you have it, and a dash of pepper. Remove the 
midribs from the leaves, put a tablespoonful of the mixture 
on the tip of the leaf, fold in the sides and roll up the leaf, 
making a roll about as thick and long as your forefinger. 
Put them in a saucepan, placing them in position to prevent 
unrolling. Squeeze over the top the juice of a lemon, and 
add sufficient boiling water to cover. Stand over a mod- 



320 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

erate fire and cook twenty minutes. Lift the rolls carefully 
on a skimmer, place them on a small heated platter, add a 
little butter to the water in which they were cooked, baste 
the rolls and send at once to the table. These may be gar- 
nished with crisp broiled bacon. 

COLD SLAW 

Shave the cabbage and soak it as directed in first 
recipe. Beat one egg without separating, add a half cupful 
of thick sour cream, a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, 
and if you have it a half saltspoonful of crushed celery 
seed. Cook over hot water until it thickens, and stand it 
aside to cool. At serving time drain and dry the cabbage, 
sprinkle over it two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice or 
vinegar, and mix it with the dressing. Garnish with capers 
or chopped olives. 

SAVOY (Borecole) 

This is a variety of cabbage with a loose head composed 
of very curly or wrinkled leaves. It is rather more delicate 
than ordinary cabbage, but is essentially a fall and winter 
vegetable. It is better made into rolls or stuffed than served 
in any other way. 

CAULIFLOWER 

Cauliflower and broccoli have all the nutritious mat- 
ter concentrated in a short, compact bunch of flowers, 
which forms a head. Cauliflower is considered more easily 
digested than cabbage. 

TO BOIL CAULIFLOWER 

Trim off the outside leaves, throw the head into cold 
water and soak for a half hour, then tie it in a square of 
cheesecloth and drop it, stem side down, in a large kettle 
of boiling salted water; boil, uncovered, for about thirty 
minutes. Be careful not to overcook, or it will become 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 321 

water soaked and lose its flavor and color. To be well 
cooked it must be snow white and tender. 

Serve with cream sauce, sauce Hollandaise or egg 
sauce. 

KALE 

Kale, another vegetable of the cabbage tribe, may be 
cooked and served according to the directions given for 
cooking spinach. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

These are composed of numerous small heads growing 
in the axils of the leaves on a long stem below the top 
leaves, and are considered the most delicate of the cabbage 
tribe, excepting cauliflower. To be perfect they should 
not be larger than an English walnut. 

TO BOIL BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Trim off the outside leaves, keeping just the hearts of 
the sprouts ; throw these into cold water, soak for one hour, 
then put them into a kettle of boiling salted water and 
cook rapidly, uncovered, until tender, about thirty minutes ; 
drain. Serve with salt and a little melted butter, or with 
cream sauce. 

COLLARDS 

Collards are cabbage in which the fleshy leaves do not 
form a head; they are held loosely on the root and stem. 
A well-grown collard looks a little like an overgrown head 
of Romaine. They may be cooked and served according 
to the rules given for spinach. 

KOHL-RABI 

This is frequently called turnip cabbage. The plant 
stores its nourishment just above the ground in a turnip- 
like swelling, and from this spring ordinary cabbage leaves. 

21 



322 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

TO BOIL KOHL-RABI 

Take off a thick paring, cut the rabi in slices, cook in 
boiling salted water until tender, about thirty minutes. Drain 
and serve slightly salted, or with melted butter, or a little 
cream, or with Maitre d'Hotel sauce. 

CARDOON (Cynara Cardunculus, Linn.) 

This plant resembles a long shaggy bunch of celery. 
The edible portion consists of thick fleshy leaf stalks, well 
bleached. Boil it in salt water, and serve with sauce Hol- 
landaise or egg sauce. 

CARROTS (Daucus Carota, Linn.) 

Young tender carrots, when fresh, are very palatable 
and wholesome. They may be boiled in plain water with- 
out salt, or in stock. 

Full grown and mature carrots contain a little sugar, 
and some starch, and are unfit for diabetic patients ; but 
the young succulent roots contain but little more than 
water and mineral matter; they have a trace of iron, and 
are considered anti-scorbutic. 

CARROTS a la POULETTE 

Scrape a bunch of very young carrots, soak them a half 
hour in cold water, then cook in boiling unsalted water 
until perfectly tender, about thirty minutes. Beat the yolk 
of an egg slightly, stir into it carefully two teaspoonfuls 
of melted butter, add four tablespoonfuls of boiling stock 
and a dash of salt ; pour this over the carrots and serve. 

CARROTS IN TURNIP CUPS 

Tiny carrots cut into dice and boiled may be seasoned 
with salt and melted butter, and served in "turnip cups." 
See Turnips. 



I 

MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 323 

OLD CARROTS 

Scrape and wash two good-sized carrots, grate them 
into a pint of boiling stock, add one good-sized onion, 
grated, simmer thirty minutes and add a half teaspoonful 
of salt, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley and the juice of 
half a lemon. Serve in a soup dish and garnish the top with 
the powdered yolk of a hard-boiled egg. 

Good in cases of chronic constipation. 



STEWED OLD CARROTS 

Scrape the carrots, cut them into thin slices and soak 
them in cold water an hour. Boil in unsalted water three- 
quarters of an hour, or until tender; drain and serve with 
cream sauce. 

PICKLED CARROTS 

Wash and scrape six good-sized full-grown carrots; 
cut them into slices crosswise a quarter of an inch thick, 
and soak in cold water for an hour. Boil in unsalted water 
until tender, about three-quarters of an hour; drain, put 
the slices into a jar with alternating layers of sliced onions; 
add two bay leaves, a half teaspoonful of crushed celery 
seed, and if you have it, a sprig of tarragon. Fill the jars 
with vinegar and stand aside for twenty-four hours. 

Pickled carrots make an exceedingly nice garnish for 
lettuce or potato salad, and may be used as a garnish for 
cold meat. 

Young pickled carrots may be used now and then in 
mild cases of diabetes and for the obese. 

CELERY (Apium graveolens, Linn.) 

For eating raw, use the tender bleached celery from 
the center of the root ; it makes a nice accompaniment to a 
broiled steak or Salisbury steaks for diabetics and the obese. 



324 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

TO PREPARE CELERY 

Trim off the root and throw the head of celery into 
cold water the moment it comes from the market. Separate 
it to the center, and with a small scrubbing- brush scrub 
each piece carefully, rinse it, put it in a bag and on the 
ice until wanted. Save the outside portion for stewing or 
for cream of celery soup, and the green tops for soup flavor- 
ing. 

TO FRINGE CELERY 

To give variety in service where there is long-continued 
feeding, fringe the celery instead of serving it plain. 

Cut nice crisp pieces of celery into two-inch lengths, 
then with a sharp knife make six or eight cuts about a half 
inch in length at both ends of these pieces ; then make 
about five parallel cuts. Throw them at once in cold water; 
in about one hour the cut portions will curl back, giving 
the celery the appearance of being fringed. 

STEWED CELERY 

Cut the outside pieces of celery into one-inch lengths, 
cover them with boiling salted water, and cook slowly for 
thirty minutes, or until the pieces are perfectly tender. 
There should now be just water enough to cover the celery ; 
add a palatable seasoning of butter, and a little pepper if 
allowable. 

CREAMED CELERY 

Cook according to the above recipe, drain off the water, 
saving it for soup. Cover the celery with cream sauce and 
send to the table. 

CELERY a la POULETTE 

Boil the celery as directed in first recipe ; drain, saving 
the water. Beat the yolk of one egg until light, add slowly 
a quarter cupful of the water in which the celery was 
boiled ; cook a minute to the thickness of mayonnaise 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 325 

dressing; stir in a teaspoonful of butter and a dash of salt. 
Dish the celery, pour over the sauce and serve. 

This makes a nice change for diabetic patients. 

CELERIAC (Apium graveolens, Variety Rapaceurri) 

Celeriac, which may be the father of celery, is a sort of 
turnip-rooted celery, which is usually peeled, boiled, cooled 
and sliced, to serve with mayonnaise dressing under the 
name of celery root salad. It also makes a good cream 
soup. 

Where restricted feeding is long continued and variety 
necessary it may be boiled and served with egg sauce. 

CUCUMBERS (Cucumis sativus, Linn.) 

Cucumbers contain but very little nourishment; they 
are rich in water and contain some mineral matter. They 
are chiefly prized for their odor and flavor. If eaten raw, 
they must be taken very young, and used the same day in 
which they are picked. They must always be soaked in 
cold water, without salt. If salt is added they lose their 
crispness, become leathery and are dangerous to persons 
of weak digestion. When carefully cooked, they are very 
easy of digestion. 

TO SERVE RAW 

Peel very young cucumbers, soak them in cold or ice 
water one hour; grate, drain, and add a little French dressing 
and use at once. 

This makes a nice accompaniment to broiled, boiled 
or baked fish. 

CUCUMBERS a la POULETTE 

Pare large cucumbers, cut them into halves, and with 
a spoon scoop out the seeds ; cut each half into three pieces 
crosswise. Put them in a piece of cheesecloth, tie loosely, 
then in a kettle of boiling salted water to cook thirty-five 



326 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

minutes. Lift the cheesecloth, put it in a colander until 
the cucumbers are thoroughly drained. Beat the yolk of 
an egg until light, add a half cupful of water in which the 
cucumbers were boiled; when thick and smooth add a half 
teaspoonful of salt, a dash of lemon juice and a teaspoonful 
of butter. Put the cucumbers in a dish, pour over the sauce 
and use at once. 

VEGETABLE MARROW (Cucurbita Ovifera, Linn.) 

These resemble long narrow cucumbers. When well 
cooked, like cucumbers, they form an excellent succulent 
vegetable. 

CHRISTOPHINES 

Christophines may be pared and cooked according to 
the recipe given for cucumber. Serve with a little salt and 
butter or egg sauce. 

SUMMER SQUASH (Cymlin) 

This belongs to the pumpkin tribe; in chemical com- 
position, how'ever, it closely resembles the cucumber and 
vegetable marrow. It may be carefully boiled in very 
little water, mashed through a colander and seasoned with 
salt and butter. Or it may be boiled carefully like cucum- 
bers, in pieces, and served with cream or egg sauce. 

EGGPLANT (AUBERGINES) 
(Solanum melongena, Linn., Variety esculentum) 

Eggplant may be a food for persons in health, but they 
take no part whatever in diet for the sick. 

HORSERADISH (Nasturtium Amoracia, Fries) 

The edible portion of this plant is the long tap root. 
It may be used in cases of prolonged feeding for the obese, 
and where continued meat diet is ordered. The aromatic 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 327 

principles which give flavor to horseradish help to make the 
meat more appetizing. 

It is usually grated and covered with vinegar. Grated 
and mixed with cream, however, it makes a much better 
condiment. 

Use it sparingly ; beware of the condiments that "bite." 

OKRA (Hibiscus esculentus, Linn.) 

The young pods of this plant constitute the edible 
portion ; they are rich in mucilage, and are used principally, 
in this country, for thickening soups. Among the Creoles 
and in the British West Indies okras are boiled in plain 
salt water and served as a vegetable. As they do not con- 
tain either starch or sugar, they make one more summer 
vegetable for the diabetic and the rheumatic. 

In our northern markets okra is frequently incorrectly 
called "gumbo." 

BOILED OKRA 

Wash six young, tender pods, soak them in cold water 
for a half hour. Drain, put them in a granite kettle, 
sprinkle with a saltspoonful of salt, cover with boiling 
water, and cook slowly thirty minutes, or until the pods 
are perfectly tender. Drain, arrange them in a small heated 
dish, put over a little butter and a dash of lemon juice. 

OKRA AND TOMATOES 

Put six small okra into a saucepan with two large 
tomatoes that have been peeled, cut into halves and the 
seeds pressed out; cover the saucepan and stew for thirty 
minutes, then add a palatable seasoning of salt and a level 
tablespoonful of butter. Serve at once in a heated dish. 

ONIONS (Allium Cepa, Linn.) 

The common onion, a large bulb, contains a very pun- 
gent flavoring due to a volatile oil, rich in sulphur. This 



328 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

odor, like the odor of cabbage, is dissipated and thrown 
off by careless cooking. Onions must be soaked in cold 
water an hour before cooking; cook in boiling salted water, 
in an uncovered vessel. Serve plain or with cream, or with 
butter. They are wholesome, rather easy of digestion 
when carefully cooked, and are stimulating to the intestines. 
They are valuable in cases of chronic constipation. 
Made into cream soup, they may be given to invalids who 
have no cardiac trouble, the aged and children. 



TO BOIL ONIONS 

Peel off the skins, and then remove another layer even 
if it seems to be tender. Soak them in cold water for a 
half hour, then boil in salted water until perfectly tender, 
about three quarters of an hour; drain, saving the water 
in which they were boiled as a flavoring for beef or other 
soup. Add a little salt, butter, or salt and cream. 



BAKED ONIONS I 

Peel a good-sized Bermuda onion, throw it into cold 
water for a half hour, then boil it in salted water for twenty 
minutes; drain, wipe it dry with a towel, brush it with 
butter, dust lightly with salt, wrap it in a piece of oiled 
paper, put it in an individual baking dish or a ramekin, 
and bake in a slow oven three quarters of an hour. 

To eat, untwist the top of the paper and scoop out the 
center of the onion with a spoon, much as you would eat 
an egg from the shell. 



BAKED ONIONS II 

Peel off the outside of the onion until you have reached 
the very tender layer. Put them into a baking dish ; cover 
with water. Cover the baking dish, and cook in a moderate 
oven one hour. Dish, and serve with a little salt and butter. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 329 

BOILED ONIONS FOR ASTHMATICS 

Peel the onions; throw them into boiling water; add a 
teaspoonful of salt, and boil carefully for three quarters of 
an hour. Drain, and press through a sieve. Reheat ; add 
a tablespoonful of cream, and serve in a heated dish. 

STUFFED SPANISH ONION 

Procure a medium-sized Spanish onion, throw it, with- 
out peeling, into a kettle of boiling salted water; keep it 
near the boiling point, but do not let it boil, for three-quarters 
of an hour. Take it out with a skimmer, remove the out- 
side skin, open it lightly and scoop out the center. Fill 
this space with nicely-seasoned chopped meat beef or 
chicken ; wrap the onion in waxed paper, stand it in an 
individual baking dish and bake in a moderate oven one 
hour. 

To serve, remove the paper, lift the onion carefully to 
a small dish, put over a little melted butter or cream sauce, 
and serve. 

In cases of rheumatism, where meat is forbidden, stuff 
it with chopped almonds mixed with bread crumbs and the 
soft portion of the onion that was scooped out. 

LEEK (A Ilium P or rum, Linn.) 

The bulb of the leek is greatly elongated, and the leaves 
broad and linear. Leeks are used to give flavoring to 
soups and sauces. 

SCULLIONS OR SPRING ONIONS 

Those who can digest them, may eat these raw with 
salt, or sliced over lettuce salad. The center soft part may 
be boiled in salt water and served the same as asparagus. 

PEPPERS 

There are many varieties and forms of pepper; they 
all belong, however, to the genus Capsicum. Tabasco 



330 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

sauce, a liquid pepper sauce made from small Tabasco pep- 
pers, is perhaps one of the best of the pepper seasonings. 
Liquid pepper is less irritating than ground pepper. 

The large sweet variety of the common peppers is used 
as a garnish to salad, or stuffed with meat and baked, or is 
made into sauce for chopped meat dishes. All these, how- 
ever, are indigestible, and to many persons quite poisonous. 

The large red "bell" pepper is used for such highly- 
seasoned dishes as tamales, chile-con-carne and curries. 

STUFFED PEPPER I 

Select one large sweet pepper, cut off the stem end, 
and remove the seeds. Wash the pepper, soak it in cold 
water for thirty minutes. Fill it with chopped, nicely- 
seasoned, beef or chicken, or mutton ; stand it in a baking 
pan, cover the bottom of the pan with water and bake 
slowly about three quarters of an hour. Just before it is 
done put a bit of butter on top and baste with a tablespoon- 
ful of the water. 

Do not allow the patient to eat the skin, but the meat 
cooked in the pepper will have a very agreeable flavor. 

STUFFED PEPPER II 

In cases where meat is forbidden, peppers may be stuffed 
with carefully-boiled rice, or chopped nuts and bread 
crumbs. 

RADISHES (Raphanus sativus, Linn.) 

Radishes contain neither starch nor sugar. When 
young and very tender they may be eaten raw, with a 
little salt; old, they are dense and difficult of digestion, 
quite unfit for persons in health. 

Carefully boiled in unsalted water, dressed with a 
little butter, they form an exceedingly nice winter vege- 
table, and are quite easy of digestion. The preferable 
varieties for boiling are the large Japanese and black 
Spanish. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 331 

TURNIPS 

Of these we use two varieties, Brassica Rapa, Linn, 
and the riita-baga or Swedish turnip; both are prepared 
after the same recipes. Turnips do not contain sugars 
nor starch, but amyloids in the form of gum and inulin, 
with quite a marked quantity of pectose. When well 
cooked, they make an agreeable and harmless vegetable for 
diabetic persons. Turnip tops, or the sprouts from old 
white turnips, dressed with French dressing, make an 
exceedingly nice spring salad. 

BOILED TURNIPS 

Pare a solid turnip, cut it into dice, and soak in cold 
water for a half hour; drain, put in a kettle of unsalted 
boiling water and boil, uncovered, for twenty minutes or 
until white and transparent. Drain in a colander. Serve 
with melted butter and a little salt to diabetic, rheu- 
matic and gouty patients. Turnips are a nice accompani- 
ment to boiled or roasted mutton. 

TOMATOES (Lycopersicum esculentum, Miller) 

Dietitians disagree regarding the advisability and 
wholesomeness of adding tomatoes to diet for the sick. Of 
this we are quite certain, persons who have rheumatic or 
gouty diathesis, or cancer, cannot eat tomatoes without 
definite and uncomfortable results. When eaten raw with 
a little sugar, or a sprinkling of salt and a little olive oil, 
they seem to agree far better than when cooked. 

TO SERVE RAW 

Select a large ripe, solid tomato, peel it carefully, with- 
out scalding, cut a thick slice from the middle of the fruit, 
dish and dust lightly with sugar or with salt, and pour over 
a tablespoonful of olive oil. 

Do not serve tomatoes with mayonnaise dressing or 
vinegar to the sick. 



332 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

SPINACH (Spinacia oleracea, Miller) 

This includes a number of varieties of the same plant, 
common spinach, green and blue, the New Zealand and 
West Indian. They differ very little chemically, and may 
be cooked and served by the same rules. 

BOILED SPINACH 

One Serving 

Wash a quart of spinach through several cold waters, 
always shaking it from the water and putting it in another 
dish of clean water. Cut off the roots. Put the leaves in 
a colander, plunge the colander down and up in a good- 
sized pan of cold water. Put a half cupful of water in a 
saucepan, put in the spinach, sprinkle over a teaspoonful 
of salt, cover the saucepan and cook slowly for twenty min- 
utes; drain carefully, and chop the spinach very, very fine. 
Return it to the saucepan, add a tablespoonful of butter, 
stir over the fire until smoking hot, arrange it in the form 
of a mound in a small heated dish, put over the top a 
hard-boiled egg pressed through a sieve, and if admissible 
garnish the edge of the dish with triangular pieces of 
toast. 

SPINACH a la CREME 

Cook the spinach as directed in first recipe. When 
done and drained, chop it very fine, put it back in the sieve 
to drain again ; when dry turn it into a saucepan, add two 
tablespoonfuls of thick cream, a dash of salt, and when hot 
serve on a piece of toasted bread, softened with two table- 
spoonfuls of hot milk. 

STACHYS (Stachys tuberosa) 

This small tuber resembles very much a short, thick 
corkscrew ; it is grown in many parts of the United States, 
but is of Japanese origin. It resembles in texture and com- 
position the Jerusalem artichoke. It contains inulin, but 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 333 

no starch. It may be boiled in unsalted water and served 
with melted butter and a dash of lemon juice, or with a 
little salt and cream. 

MOCK ARTICHOKES 

Pare a solid white turnip, cut it into slices a quarter 
of an inch thick, and with a round cutter, cut from each 
slice a "cake" about an inch and a half in diameter. Cook 
in boiling unsalted water until perfectly transparent. Ar- 
range them on a small platter, one slice overlapping the 
other; put at the end of the platter a well-made egg sauce. 

k 

MASHED TURNIPS 

Boil the turnips according _to the first recipe, drain 
in a colander, press through a colander and add salt and 
butter. 



334 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



EDIBLE WEEDS 

SOURDOCK (Rumex cripus, Linn.) 

Sourdock contains a small amount of oxalic acid and 
cannot be used in ordinary sick diet unless ordered by a 
physician. It is cooked the same as spinach. 

SORREL (Rumex Acetosella, Linn.) 

What is true of sourdock is true also of sorrel. Culti- 
vated sorrel contains less acid than the wild variety. It is 
not palatable alone, as a salad, but chopped and sprinkled 
over lettuce gives variety to the diet in diabetes. 

POKE SHOOTS 

The young shoots of the Phytolocca decandra may be 
boiled and served on toast with cream sauce or melted 
butter alone, same as asparagus. When well cooked, they 
are tender and easy of digestion ; good in cases of chronic 
constipation. 

LAMBS' QUARTERS 
(Chenopodium capitatum, Watson) 

Lambs' quarters grow in almost every garden and 
make the most delicate of the greens. Cook them the same 
as you would cook spinach ; they are much better. 

PURSLANE (Portulacca oleracea, Linn.) 

Purslane is a hardy annual plant, a common weed in 
most yards. If it grows in a garden where it is slightly 
cultivated, it is much better. Boiled in plain salt water 
makes an exceedingly good green. Is valuable in chronic 
constipation, chronic rheumatism or gout. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 335 

SHEPHERDS' PURSE 
(Capsella Bursa-Pastoris, Moench) 

This is also a common weed, which may be washed, 
boiled and served same as spinach. 

DANDELION (Taraxacum officinale, Weber) 

Almost everybody knows that the early shoots from 
the dandelion roots make a very good "green" as well as 
a salad. From a medicinal standpoint, the tender shoots 
served raw are best. If boiled, use as little water as pos- 
sible; cook them the same as spinach. The tender shoots 
soaked in cold water, make an admirable salad when 
dressed with French dressing. Good for rheumatics, liver 
and certain urinary troubles. 

MINT 

The ordinary spearmint (Mentha viridis, Linn.) is used 
with vinegar in mint sauce. Without sugar it makes an 
agreeable addition to lamb in diabetic diet. It is also nice 
chopped and sprinkled over a cabbage salad. A bit of mint 
cooked with string beans gives them a new and attractive 
flavor. 

PARSLEY (Carum petroselinum, Bentham) 

A little chopped parsley over a dish of creamed pota- 
toes, lettuce salad or carefully-cooked turnips makes a 
pretty garnish and gives a nice flavor. 

Curly parsley is the most popular garnish for meats 
and fish. 



336 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



THE COMMON SALAD PLANTS 

While many of the plants in this .group are frequently 
cooked, they are decidedly more palatable and attractive 
when served raw. They are quite free from starch and 
sugar, are very succulent, containing about ninety-five per 
cent, water and a small amount of mineral matter. They 
are valuable waste food. Many contain pungent volatile 
oils, to which they owe their flavor. 



CHICORY (Cichorium Intybus, Linn.) 

Young and tender chicory makes one of the nicest of 
salads. It conies in the winter when lettuce is not good. 
It should be washed in cold water, put into a dry napkin 
or small bag and hung up in a cold place or put on the ice 
until serving time. The outside leaves of chicory may be 
cooked the same as spinach. 

CORN SALAD OR LAMB'S LETTUCE 

(Valerianella olitoria, Poll) 

While this plant grows abundant and wild in Southern 
Europe, it is cultivated in the United States for an early 
spring salad green. It has little or no place in diet for the 
sick, it wilts quickly and unless carefully treated becomes 
indigestible. 

ENDIVE (Cichorium Endivia, Linn.) 

The ordinary American endive makes a good fall and 
winter salad. Like chicory, the very tender middle shoots 
must be used. The outside bitter leaves may be cooked 
and served the same as spinach. It is said to be good in 
cases of chronic rheumatism or gout, or for people who 
have inactive or sluggish livers. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 337 

IMPORTED ENDIVE 

The imported endive or Batavia, which is also grown 
in this country, belongs to the same family as our ordinary 
variety, but is treated in a different manner. The first 
leaves are cut from the roots, leaving a crown; the roots 
are buried in sand, and it is the second crop of leaves that 
are used for salads. It makes a most appetizing salad. If 
allowable, it may be served with mayonnaise, but as a rule 
French dressing is to be preferred. 



GARDEN CRESS OR PEPPER GRASS 
(Lepidium sativum) 

This resembles in flavor and slightly in appearance the 
ordinary water cress ; it must, however, be used when very 
tender and young or it becomes pungent and bitter. It 
makes a better salad flavoring than a salad. A few leaves 
sprinkled over lettuce or over a well-made cabbage salad 
give variety to dinner salads. 



LETTUCE (Lactuca sativa, Linn.) 

We have many, many varieties of lettuce in the mar- 
ket ; all of them, when young, tender and crisp, are whole- 
some, cooling, palatable, and if thoroughly masticated, 
digestible. The cos or upright lettuce, known in the market 
as Romaine, served with French dressing, makes one of the 
most attractive of salads. 



STEWED LETTUCE 

Wash thoroughly a fine head of lettuce; with a sharp 

knife shred it across the head, put it in a kettle, with a 

half pint of boiling water, and a half teaspoonful of salt; 

cover the kettle and cook slowly for at least three quarters 

22 



338 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

of an hour, until the lettuce is perfectly tender. Drain, 
chop it very fine, add a little butter and it is ready to serve. 
Good for diabetic patients. Lettuce may also be stuffed 
with meat and served the same as savoy. 

MUSTARD 

The leaves of the young Brassica alba are sweet and 
bland, and may be served alone with French dressing as a 
salad, but are much better sprinkled over lettuce or cab- 
bage or young chicory. 

WATER CRESS (Nasturtium officinale, R. Brown) 

This plant grows wild over a number of our running 
streamlets. It must be well washed, the leaves broken 
from the stems, or very young shoots used. It is anti- 
scorbutic and makes an- excellent salad in chronic consti- 
pation. Many German physicians give it in cases of in- 
active livers. 

All uncooked vegetables must be thoroughly masti- 
cated. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 339 



SALADS 

Nearly all cold cooked green vegetables, as well as the 
tender uncooked leaves of such vegetables as lettuce and 
cress, with French dressing, make palatable and sightly 
salads; they cannot, however, be considered sick diet. 
Where feeding is long continued, as in chronic rheumatism, 
gout, tuberculosis, chronic constipation and in certain cases 
of diabetes, salads are to be recommended. Do not use 
mayonnaise dressing, unless now and then with a peeled 
tomato or on very tender celery. 

Use pure olive oil, with a little salt and lemon juice or 
pure apple vinegar. 

Thick dressings, made from butter and cream or thick- 
ened milk, are not acceptable to a weak stomach. Fruit 
salads are, as a rule, unpalatable and frequently nauseating 
to the sick. The only fruits that make an attractive and 
wholesome salad are grape fruit and apples, served with 
French dressing, not mayonnaise. 

Where waste food is necessary as well as bulk, green 
vegetable salads are excellent. They contain the salts 
necessary to the well-being of the blood, the oil is an im- 
portant food, and the vinegar or lemon juice gives appetite, 
which aids in the digestion and assimilation. 

In winter, hard white cabbage, shaved as fine as hair, 
soaked in cold water for one or two hours, drained and 
served with French dressing, makes the best salad in cases 
of rheumatism, chronic constipation or gout. It is an ex- 
ceedingly nice accompaniment to plain broiled oysters. 
Also good as bulk food in cases of obesity. 

As soon as green vegetables come home from the mar- 
ket put them in cold water, soak for a half hour, wash 
thoroughly and put in a bag or salad shaker and on ice, 
or in any cold place, until dry and crisp. The better way 
is, put them in a cheesecloth bag, on the ice; then, each 
time a salad is needed take out the desired quantity, which 
will be cold and crisp, and most important, dry.'' 



340 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

The dressing should be made at the last minute, poured 
over the salad, the salad thoroughly mixed and served at 
once. If the dish is handsomely garnished, take it to the 
patient without dressing, keeping the dressing in a tiny 
pitcher or bowl. Pour over the dressing, mix, and allow 
the patient to eat it from the dish on which you have 
mixed it. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

Put a saltspoonful of salt and a half drop of Tabasco 
(if admissible) into a bowl or soup plate, put in a piece 
of ice the size of an egg, rub the salt with the ice until 
the salt is dissolved, pour over two tablespoonfuls of olive 
oil, stir a moment, remove the ice, add a teaspoonful of 
lemon juice or vinegar and beat a moment until the dress- 
ing is rather thick and opaque. Use -at once. This will 
be sufficient for one person. 

The flavoring of the dressing may be changed by rub- 
bing the spoon with a clove of garlic, adding tarragon in- 
stead of plain vinegar, or sprinkle various chopped herbs 
over the lettuce. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Put the uncooked yolk of one egg into a clean, cold 
soup dish, add a half drop of Tabasco and a pinch of salt; 
stir with a fork until well mixed, and add, drop by drop, 
four tablespoonfuls of olive oil ; add a few drops of lemon 
juice or vinegar, and put it into the serving receptacle. 
Stand aside in a cold place until wanted. 

Where a large quantity of mayonnaise is needed, of 
course the proportions must be larger; start with the yolks 
of two eggs instead of one. 

WHITE MAYONNAISE 

Make a plain mayonnaise dressing and stand it aside 
until wanted. At serving time put six tablespoonfuls of 
thick cream into a small bowl, stand it in another of cracked 
ice, and with an ordinary wire egg beater or a Dover beater 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 341 

beat the cream to a stiff froth ; fold it into the mayonnaise 
and use it at once. 

This is nice for very tender celery or cold boiled fish.

342 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

BREAD MAKING 

Bread for persons in health, as well as those in disease, 
should be made from good strong flour and the best com- 
pressed yeast or sweet homemade yeast. It should not 
contain either sugar, lard or butter. According to my way 
of thinking, bread is much better made in daylight than in 
the dark. It should be sponged early in the morning, and 
baked at noon, or a little before. It should be made into 
small square loaves, each loaf put into a separate pan and 
baked. When taken from the oven, turn it out on a wire 
rest, or stand the loaf leaning against the pan so that the 
air may circulate freely around it. Do not cover it with 
either paper or cloth. If covered, the moisture is retained, 
the bread spoils quickly and the crust becomes soft. 

Fresh bread should not be eaten by the well or sick. 
In every well-regulated household enough bread should be 
made one day to last an entire week. Small breads, bis- 
cuit, bread sticks and Vienna rolls may be placed in a hot 
oven five minutes before serving time to renew their crisp- 
ness. No matter how stale the bread or rolls, a few min- 
utes in a hot oven will make them crisp and palatable. 

Reheat or rebake only the quantity required. The 
evaporation of water under the influence of heat makes them 
hard and unpalatable when reheated a second time. 

To Keep Bread: When the bread is cool put it away, 
without wrappings, in a perfectly clean tin box. The fibre 
of either linen or cotton takes up the moisture thrown off 
from the bread, and will in a short time sour, become moldy 
and contaminate the bread. Sour, moldy bread is un- 
wholesome, if not dangerous. 

TWENTIETH CENTURY BREAD 

Pour one pint of boiling water into one pint of milk. 
When lukewarm add a teaspoonful of salt, half an ounce 
of compressed yeast moistened in two tablespoonfuls of 
warm water, then sufficient whole wheat flour to make a 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 343 

batter that will drop from the spoon. Beat thoroughly 
for about five minutes, scrape down the side of the bowl, 
remove the spoon, stand the bowl in a pan of warm water, 
cover the whole, keep in a warm place (75 Fahr.) for 
three hours. Then stir in gradually sufficient whole wheat 
flour to make a dough. Turn the mixture on the baking 
board and knead thoroughly until soft and elastic. It must 
not be dry and need not necessarily lose all its stickiness. 
Cut the mixture into four loaves, roll them out, under the 
hand, about twelve inches in length and three inches in 
diameter. Place them in long French bread pans, cover 
and stand in a warm place for one hour and bake in a quick 
oven thirty-five to forty minutes. 

This bread, well buttered, is a perfect food. It contains 
the mineral matter of the wheat, and should be the only 
bread given to children. 

WHITE BREAD 

Pour one pint of boiling water into one pint of milk. 
When lukewarm add a teaspoonful of salt, half an ounce 
of compressed yeast moistened in two tablespoonfuls of 
warm water. Then add, gradually beating all the while, 
sufficient flour to make a dough. Take the mixture on the 
board and knead it until it loses its stickiness and is soft 
and elastic. Put it back into the bowl, stand it in a pan 
of warm water, cover the whole for three hours. Then 
turn the dough on the board, form into two loaves, stand 
aside for one hour, and bake in a quick oven thirty minutes. 
This bread may be used as a dinner bread 'or with any 
meal where concentrated nitrogenous foods are served. 

HOMEMADE YEAST 

Use Fleischmann's compressed yeast cakes if you can 
get them, especially in making bread for the sick. If this 
is out of the question, use as next choice good homemade 
yeast. 



344 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Grate four good-sized potatoes into one quart of boil- 
ing water, cook and stir over the fire for five minutes ; when 
cool add two tablespoonfuls of salt, a half cupful of sugar, 
a half cupful of homemade yeast or one compressed yeast 
cake dissolved in a half cupful of cool water. Put this in 
a good-sized stone or glass jar, cover with a saucer and 
stand in a warm place (68 Fahr.) for several hours. Each 
time the mixture comes to the top of the jar stir it down, 
and keep stirring it down until fermentation stops. Bottle, 
cork with a cotton plug and keep in a cold place. 

One cupful of this yeast will make three one-pound 
loaves of bread. 



Scald one pint of milk, add one pint of water, and 
when lukewarm add a half teaspoonful of salt, a table- 
spoonful of sugar, one cupful of homemade yeast and suffi- 
cient flour to make a batter that will drop rather than pour 
from a spoon. Beat thoroughly for ten minutes, by time; 
add another.cupful of flour, mix thoroughly, cover and stand 
in a warm place over night. Next morning add sufficient 
flour to make a dough ; knead this until it is soft and elastic, 
put it back in the bowl, cover, and when it has doubled its 
bulk in two and a half or three hours, mold it into loaves, put 
each loaf in a greased square pan, cover, and when it 
has doubled its bulk and is very light, bake in a moderately 
quick oven three-quarters of an hour. 



GRAHAM BREAD 

To make one loaf of Graham bread, take one pint of 
white sponge ; add a tablespoonful of molasses and stir in 
sufficient Graham flour to make a batter, that is difficult to 
stir but not sufficiently stiff to knead. Pour into a greased 
square pan ; let it stand one hour, and bake in a moderate 
oven three-quarters of an hour. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 345 

PULLED BREAD 

Pulled bread is simply the crumb of a one-day old loaf, 
pulled or cut apart into strips and carefully rebaked. Trim 
the crusts from the outside of the, entire loaf; begin at one 
end of the loaf, pull it into halves, using two forks, then 
pull each half into quarters and eighths. Put these in a 
baking pan lined with brown paper, stand the pan in the 
warm oven, with the door open, until the bread is dry, then 
close the door and toast it to a golden brown. To be 
exactly right it must be crisp to the very center. It may 
be kept in a tin box, and reheated. The ordinary long 
French loaf, that can be purchased in any city, makes the 
best pulled bread. 

BREAD STICKS 

Use either of the preceding rules for bread. When the 
bread is light at molding time, take off a tiny portion the 
size of a marble, roll it out under your hand until it is 
four or five inches long and the size of a lead pencil. Put 
it in a greased baking pan or into a bread stick pan ; cover 
and stand aside a half hour in a warm place. Bake in a 
quick oven fifteen minutes. 

RUSKS 

Scald one quart of milk, add to it two tablespoonfuls 
of sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, and when lukewafm, half an 
ounce of compressed yeast, moistened in two tablespoon- 
fuls of warm water. Now add sufficient flour, about one 
pint and a half to make a batter. Beat thoroughly and 
stand in a pan of warm water, cover the whole and keep 
warm for four hours. When light add sufficient flour to 
make a dough, knead lightly until soft and elastic. Put it 
back in the bowl and when it has doubled its bulk and is 
very light, pinch off bits of the dough, form them into round 
biscuits, stand in greased pans, cover and stand in a warm 
place (75 Fahr.) for one hour or until very light. Brush 



346 . MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

i 

the tops with water and bake in a quick oven twenty min- 
utes. Stand aside until cold and they are ready for making 
into zweiback. 

ZWEIBACK 
i 

After the rusks have been baked according to the 
preceding recipe, and are quite cold, pull them into halves, 
put them on brown paper in an ordinary shallow baking 
pan, baked side down, dry them in a moderate oven, with 
the door open, until they are crisp but not brown, then 
close the door and toast them gradually, watching care- 
fully, until they are a light brown. To be quite perfect, 
they must be crisp to the very center. 

These will keep, in a tin box, in a dry place, for a week. 

ZWEIBACK SLICES 

Make the rusk dough according to the recipe given, 
but knead it into two round loaves, put these in round, 
shallow basins, and when light bake as directed; stand 
them aside over night. Next morning cut the loaves into l 
slices a half inch thick, put them >n brown paper in a 
shallow baking pan and toast as directed for rusks. 

UNLEAVENED BREAD 

Unleavened bread is bread made without yeast or mate- 
rials that produce fermentation when moistened. No means 
are taken to make the bread light except ordinary kneading 
and beating, which aerates the dough. 

Put a quart of flour in a bowl, add a half teaspoonful 
of salt and sufficient water and milk mixed to make a dough 
that is rather stiff. Take this on a board, and knead and 
work it with the hands until it becomes soft and elastic. 
Pound it with an ordinary potato masher, folding the dough 
over as you pound it out ; or, if you live in the South, use 
the ordinary Maryland biscuit "brake." When the dough 
is light and seems filled with air bubbles, make it into small 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 347 

biscuits or tiny rolls the length and size of your finger, or 
it may be rolled into a thin sheet and cut into squares. All 
unleavened bread must be baked in a moderate oven until 
thoroughly done and lightly browned. 

PASSOVER BREAD 

Make an unleavened dough, pound it and knead it until 
very light, take off a piece the size of a teacup, roll it in 
a very thin sheet, cut it into rounds the size of an ordinary 
breakfast plate, pick them carefully with a fork, and bake 
in a moderate oven until slightly browned, thoroughly 
dried and crisp. 

WHOLE WHEAT FINGERS 

Make a dough as directed for unleavened bread, using 
whole wheat flour in the place of white flour. When the 
dough is soft and elastic, roll it into a very thin sheet, 
cut into small squares with pastry jagger, and bake thor- 
oughly in a moderate oven. 

If these are to be served warm, bake them in a quick 
oven to make them puff. 

UNLEAVENED WHOLE WHEAT GEMS 

Grease iron gem pans, and put them into a very hot 
oven. Put one pint of ice water in a bowl, and stir in 
hastily, beating rapidly, a half pint of whole wheat flour. 
Pour this into the hot gem pans, and bake in a quick oven 
twenty minutes. Two tablespoonfuls is quite enough for 
one gem. If well made they resemble popovers. 

TO MAKE BRAN FLOUR 

Take three quarts of wheat bran, and boil in two successive 
waters for ten minutes, each time straining through a 
sieve. Then wash it well with cold water in the sieve until 
the water runs off perfectly clear ; squeeze the bran in a cloth 
until dry, spread it in a granite baking pan and dry it in a 



348 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

slow oven. A very good way is to put it in the oven at night, 
allowing it to remain until the morning. The oven must be 
sufficiently hot to dry the bran or it will ferment. When 
perfectly dry and crisp grind it through a coffee mill and sift 
through a fine hair sieve. If any portion of the bran is 
retained in the sieve put it back and grind it over. Put the 
flour thus produced in glass jars and stand aside for use. 

THE BRAN LOAF AND GEMS 

To make bran bread or gems, beat three eggs without 
separating, add to them a half pint of milk, then stir in three 
ounces of bran flour. Add a half teaspoonful of ground 
ginger, 35 grains of bicarbonate of soda and three drops of 
dilute hydrochloric acid. Pour into greased gem pans or into 
a small square bread pan and bake in a moderate oven about 
three-quarters of an hour. 

BISCUITS FROM BRAN FLOUR 

Beat three eggs without separating. Mix with six ounces 
of bran flour half teaspoonful of ginger, 35 grains of bicar- 
bonate of soda ; add one tablespoonful of molasses and the 
eggs to a half pint of water and stir into the bran. Knead 
using more bran flour if necessary, roll out in a very thin 
sheet, cut into squares, bake lightly until thoroughly crisp. 
These will keep for a long time in a tin box. 

BRAN STICKS 

Moisten bran flour, prepared according to the first recipe, 
with a little cold milk. The dough must be stiff enough to 
roll, when well worked. Roll it out the length of your 
finger and a little larger than a lead pencil. Place on 
greased paper in a baking pan, and bake in a slow oven. 

BRAN SHEET 

Beat two tablespoonfuls of butter to a cream. Dis- 
solve a saltspoonful of soda in a tablespoonful of water, 
add it to the butter, add two tablespoonfuls of milk and one 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 349 

beaten egg; stir in sufficient bran flour to make a very stiff 
dough. Knead well and roll it out into a sheet as thin as a 
wafer; cut it into squares of two inches, lift with a broad 
knife, place on greased paper, in baking pans, and bake in 
a very slow oven until crisp and slightly brown. 

BRAN CAKES 

Take two ounces of the bran flour and rub in one 
tablespoonful of butter. Beat two eggs, without separating, 
until light, add a half pint of milk, stir this into the bran, 
add a level teaspoonful of baking powder and drop quickly 
into greased gem pans, or spread on oiled paper in the bottom 
of a baking pan. It must not be over an eighth of an inch 
thick. Bake until crisp and hard. 

All these bran breads take the place of ordinary bread 
for diabetic patients. It must be remembered that bran is 
quite irritating to the intestinal tract; if diarrhoea is pro- 
duced, substitute gluten breads. 

PURGATIVE BISCUITS 

Put four ounces of whole wheat flour into a bowl, add 
to it two tablespoonfuls of rolled oats, six ounces of moist 
browned sugar, thirty grains of brown Jamaica ginger, 
sixty grains of powdered jalap, and mix thoroughly to- 
gether. Beat three whole eggs, stir them into the mixture, 
knead, roll out to a thin sheet, cut into eighteen square 
biscuits, and bake in a slow oven one hour. These must be 
thoroughly dry to the very center and a golden brown. 
One at bedtime, thoroughly masticated and followed by 
a half glass of cold water, will relieve the most obstinate 
cases of chronic constipation. 

SWEDISH SHEETS 

Add a half teaspoonful of salt to one quart of whole 
wheat flour, rub into it a tablespoonful of olive oil, then 
add sufficient cold water to make a very hard dough. 



350 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Knead and beat this dough with a potato masher until it 
becomes soft and elastic. Take off a portion of the dough, 
roll it into a very thin sheet, not over an eighth of an inch 
in thickness; cut this into biscuits about the size of a 
breakfast plate put a plate down and cut around it. Pick 
them to the very bottom with a steel fork, bake them at 
first in a quick oven, then allow the oven to cool until the 
cakes are thoroughly dry to the very center. 

These should be crisp and brittle. An exceedingly 
good bread for dyspeptics. 

PEPTIC BREAD 

Sift one quart of flour, four level teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder and a half teaspoonful of salt together three times. 
Beat two eggs, without separating, add one pint of milk, 
turn this into the flour, and stir quickly and thoroughly until 
the dough is well mixed. Turn at once into two greased 
pans, stand aside ten minutes, and bake in a moderately 
quick oven three-quarters of an hour. 

SCHOOL LUNCHEON BREAD 

Sift two cupfuls of flour, a half teaspoonful of salt and 
two rounding teaspoonfuls of baking powder together ; add 
one cupful of chopped peanuts, or English walnuts, or 
pecans, and one cupful of currants or raisins. Beat one 
egg until well mixed, without separating, add one table- 
spoonful of molasses and a half pint of milk. Add these to 
the dry ingredients, stir until well mixed, turn into a 
greased square bread pan and stand aside ten minutes. 
Bake in a moderate oven forty minutes. 

Cut into thin slices and buttered, this makes exceed- 
ingly nice sandwiches for school luncheons. 

THE NUT LOAF 

Put two cupfuls of flour, two rounding teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder and a half teaspoonful of salt in a flour 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 351 

sieve, sift thoroughly once or twice and add two-thirds of a 
cupful of finely-chopped nuts, pecans or peanuts. Beat one 
egg lightly, without separating, add one cupful of milk, 
turn this into the flour mixture, stir thoroughly and quickly 
until well mixed, turn into a square greased pan, cover, 
stand aside ten minutes, and bake in a moderately quick oven 
three-quarters of an hour. 

Raisin Bread Make precisely the same as nut bread, 
substituting a cupful of chopped raisins for the nuts. 

QUICK BISCUITS 

While hot yeast breads of all kinds should be avoided both 
by the well and sick, a warm baking-powder biscuit may now 
and then be used. Put one quart of flour in a bowl, rub in 
quickly a tablespoonful of butter or a tablespoonful of olive oil. 
Add half a teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder, mix thoroughly and add sufficient milk, about a cup 
and a half, to make a moist dough. Take the dough out on the 
board, knead lightly and quickly, roll into a sheet half an inch 
thick. Cut into small round biscuits, stand them in a greased 
pan, sufficiently far apart not to touch. Brush the tops with 
milk and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. These may be 
made from either whole wheat or white flour. 

GEMS 

Separate two eggs, beat the yolks and add one cupful (a 
half pint) of milk; add a half teaspoonful of salt and one 
and three quarters cupfuls of flour. Beat thoroughly, add 
two rounding teaspoonfuls of baking powder, beat again, 
fold in the well-beaten whites of the eggs, and bake in 
twelve greased gem pans, in a quick oven, twenty minutes. 

This recipe will answer for whole wheat or rye meal gems. 

RICE GEMS 

Add a cupful of left-over cold boiled rice to the preceding 
recipe. 



352 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

. OATMEAL GEMS 

Add one cupful of left-over oatmeal breakfast mush to- the 
recipe for gems. 

FRUIT GEMS 

Add a half cupful of chopped dates, figs or raisins to the 
recipe for gems just before folding in the whites of the eggs. 
Whole wheat flour is preferable to white flour for fruit gems. 

CORN DODGERS 

Put one pint of white cornmeal into a bowl, put in the 
center a tablespoonful of shortening, and pour over sufficient 
boiling water to just wet the meal ; it must not be too moist. 
Cover and let it stand until cool. Beat one egg, without sepa- 
rating, until light, add six tablespoonfuls of milk, and stir 
them thoroughly into the meal. Drop by tablespoonfuls on 
a greased shallow baking pan, and bake in a moderately 
quick oven a half hour. 

The batter must be sufficiently thick to keep the shape of 
the spoon when dropped in the pan. 

GERMAN PUFFS OR POPOVERS 

Beat two eggs, without separating, until well mixed, add 
a half pint of milk and pour gradually into a half pint of 
flour; mix well and strain through a sieve into the first bowl. 
Grease and heat the gem pans, half fill each with this thin 
batter, and bake in a moderately quick oven for forty minutes. 
These may be used as breakfast muffins, or served with a sauce 
as dessert. 

VIRGINIA WAFERS 

Put two tablespoonfuls of olive oil or two tablespoonfuls 
of butter into one quart of flour and rub thoroughly. Add half 
a teaspoonful of salt. Add sufficient milk to make a dough. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 353 

Knead it thoroughly until it becomes soft and elastic and is free 
from stickiness. Then pound it for twenty minutes, folding the 
dough over and over. When light and filled with air bubbles 
roll it out into a very thin sheet, cut into squares of two inches, 
pick the tops with a fork, and bake slowly in a moderate 
oven. If well made, these will puff and be very light and 
crisp. Make without shortening for people with weak diges- 
tion, and bake until hard, to necessitate thorough mastica- 
tion. Use either whole wheat or white flour. 

MARYLAND BISCUITS 

Maryland biscuits may be made by following the pre- 
ceding recipe. Roll the mixture out about a quarter of an 
inch in thickness, cut it into round biscuits, pick it over the 
top with a fork and bake in a slow oven for a half hour. 

GLUTEN BREAD FROM MOIST GLUTEN 

Put two quarts of flour in a bowl, add sufficient wateir 
to make a very hard dough. Knead this dough until thor- 
oughly mixed, then put it on a sieve, under a small stream 
of water, and knead until the dough is nearly free from 
starch. When the water is clear, take the remaining gluey 
mass to the bread board, add a teaspoonful of baking 
powder, mix, break off a piece about the size of an English 
walnut, and roll it out under your hand into a stick about 
four inches long and the size of a lead pencil. Put these 
on an oiled paper and bake in a very slow oven until crisp. 

If these are to be served warm, bake them in a quick oven, 
which gives an entirely different effect. 

THE GLUTEN LOAF 

Scald one pint of milk; when lukewarm add one com- 
pressed yeast cake moistened in a half cupful of warm water, 
and a half teaspoonful of salt. Stir iii sufficient 80% gluten 
flour, beating all the while, to make a rather stiff dough; 

23 



354 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

cover and stand aside for three hours. Then beat rapidly 
five minutes, turn into a greased square bread pan, and 
when again light, about one and a half to two hours, bake 
in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. 

Gluten bread may be used for rheumatic patients, or to 
give variety in tuberculosis cases, where the diet is restricted 
for a long time. It is not fit, however, for diabetic persons 
unless you use 80% gluten flour. 

ALEURONAT GEMS 

Beat the yolk of an egg until creamy, then fold in the well- 
beaten white, add a saltspoonful of salt, four level tablespoon- 
fuls of aleuronat ; mix carefully, drop by tablespoonfuls into 
greased gem pans, bake in a quick oven a half hour, then cool 
the oven and bake ten minutes longer. 

ALEURONAT MUFFINS 

Separate one egg; beat the yolk until it is creamy, add a 
half cupful of milk and a saltspoonful of salt. Sift a half cup- 
ful of aleuronat with a level teaspoonful of baking powder; 
stir this into the egg and milk, fold in the well-beaten white of 
the egg, and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. These 
may be eaten warm, or pulled apart and toasted. This quan- 
tity makes four muffins. 

ALEURONAT MUSH 

Put a half cupful of water in a small saucepan ; when boil- 
ing add a saltspoonful of salt, stir in carefully two level table- 
spoonfuls of aleuronat, stir constantly for five minutes, boiling 
all the while. Turn at once into the serving saucer, and 
when partly cool serve with cream or milk. 

Serve cool because the odor of hot gluten food is par- 
ticularly disagreeable to many persons.

CEREAL FOODS 

Under this heading I shall place all the ordinary grains, 
the seeds of grasses, as wheat, oats, barley, corn and rice, 
although the recipes for cooking rice will be found under the 
starchy vegetables. 

Many of these seeds are almost typical food for man. 
Wheat, for instance, needs only the addition of a little fat. 
White bread, however, must not be mistaken for the whole 
wheat grain. In making flour many elements of the wheat are 
lost, and unless we purchase a good strong flour we are 
robbed of mineral matter and protein. The principal 
carbohydrate is starch, which is about seventy per cent, of 
the entire grain. The mineral matter is about two per cent, 
of the grain. The cellulose is found principally in the outer 
husk ; it is indestructible in the digestive tract, and for this 
reason is used in severe cases of chronic constipation ; but 
I doubt very much if bran can be eaten any length of time 
without serious results. All cereals must be thoroughly 
cooked.

OATS (Avena sativa) 

Oats is very rich in nitrogenous matter and contains 
more fatty matter and iron than most grains. Well cooked 
and served with milk and a little salt, it makes an ideal 
breakfast food for children. The old-fashioned Scotch or 
Irish oatmeal and Akron oatmeal should be cooked for 
several hours. Rolled oats cooks in less time, but even this 
should be boiled for one to two hours. 

In serving cereals, use one morning, oatmeal, another 
Cream of Wheat, another Wheatena or Wheatlet, carefully- 
boiled rice, bran mush, cornmeal mush, hominy grits, or 
stale cubes of bread and cream. Keep in mind that oatmeal 
and hominy grits and wheatena and wheatlet are typical 
winter or cold-climate foods, and rice, Cream of Wheat and 
farina are better adapted to warm weather. 

SCOTCH OATMEAL 

Sprinkle three tablespoonfuls of Scotch oatmeal into one 
pint of boiling water, in the top of a double boiler; put 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 357 

this directly over the fire for a minute, bring to boiling 
point, add a saltspoonful of salt, cover, put the upper part 
back in the lower part of the boiler and cook continuously 
for two hours ; stand it aside over night. In the morning 
reheat without stirring. It should be jellylike and soft, not 
pasty. Do not add sugar to cereals, either for the well or 
sick. 



This recipe will answer for all kinds of rolled oats. 

Put one pint of boiling water in the upper part of a 
double boiler, add a saltspoonful of salt, and when the 
water in the under vessel is boiling rapidly sprinkle in one 
cupful of rolled oats; allow each grain, if possible, to fall 
in separately. Do not stir it. Cover and boil continuously 
for one hour. Dip this into the serving dish carefully, with- 
out breaking the grains. 

OATMEAL WITH FRUIT MERINGUE 

Left-over oatmeal may be turned at once into a small 
round mold; at serving time turn out the mold, cut the 
oatmeal into thin slices, put a slice in the serving dish, 
cover with strawberries, raspberries, very ripe blackberries, 
or sliced peaches; put on another slice of oatmeal and dust 
lightly with powdered sugar. Beat the white of one egg 
to a stiff froth, add a tablespoonful of powdered sugar, beat 
again until fine and glossy; spread this over the oatmeal 
top and sides, dust again with powdered sugar, run it in 
the oven just a moment, to brown the meringue. Serve at 
once, with a tiny pitcher of cream. 

Excellent for children and good in cases of chronic 
constipation. 

A baking-powder box makes an exceedingly good mold. 

ROLLED WHEAT 

This may be cooked precisely the same as rolled oats. 



358 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

BARLEY (Hordeum vulgare) 
Rolled barley may be cooked precisely the same as 

rolled oats. 

This is frequently used in place of oats, or grits for 

the rheumatic and gouty. 

RYE 

The common rye (Secede cereale) makes an exceedingly 
good food in cases of chronic constipation, rheumatism, gout 
and intestinal indigestion. 

RYE MUSH 

Purchase rye meal, a coarse meal containing a part of 
the bran. Put a pint of water in the upper part of the 
double boiler, add a saltspoonful of salt; when this is boil- 
ing sprinkle in carefully, stirring all the while, a half cupful 
of rye meal ; cover the saucepan and cook slowly one hour. 
Serve with cream or milk. 

WHEAT GERM CEREALS 

We find in the markets of the United States a long 
list of breakfast foods quite different in chemical composi- 
tion from common cereals. Many of them are made from a 
portion of the grain only. If they contain the germ of the 
grain, they are rich in fatty matter. When well cooked, and 
served with milk, without sugar, they are excellent winter 
breakfast cereals for children and the aged. 

They are sold under the names of Wheatena, Wheat-

WHEAT GERM PORRIDGE 

This rule will answer for the cooking of all wheat 
germ cereals. 

Put a pint of boiling water into the upper part of a 
double boiler, add a saltspoonful of salt, and when this is 
boiling sprinkle in slowly, stirring all the while, a half 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 359 

cupful of cereal; stir and boil for six minutes, then cover 
the vessel and cook for a half hour. 

As these are rich in fat, serve with milk instead of 
cream and do not add sugar for children. 

Cold left-over germ cereals may be molded and served 
cold with a sauce Sabayon, plain cream or fruits. 

WHEAT GERM TIMBALE 

Pour left-over cereal into a custard cup and stand 
away until cold. At serving time turn out the cereal and 
scoop out the center, leaving a very thin wall. Stand the 
"cup" in a dainty serving dish, fill the center with straw- 
berries, raspberries, blackberries or chopped peaches; dust 
lightly with powdered sugar and serve with a tiny pitcher 
of cream. Very pretty. 

WHEAT GERM SOUFFLE 

Cook a half quantity of wheat germ cereal according 
to the first recipe ; when done add to it the yolk of an egg, 
stir, and fold in the well-beaten white, turn it into an in- 
dividual baking dish and bake in a quick oven fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Serve in the dish in which it was baked. 

This takes the place of cereal and meat for breakfast. 

FARINA 

Farina does not contain as much nitrogenous matter 
as cereals made from the whole grain, but it is delicate and 
easy of digestion. For young children and invalids it makes 
an admirable supper food. 

Cream of Wheat may be cooked according to any of 
the recipes given for farina. 

FARINA PORRIDGE 

Put a pint of boiling water into a saucepan directly 
over the fire, add a saltspoonful of salt, and sprinkle in 
slowly a half cupful of farina, stirring all the while. Boil 



360 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

rapidly, stirring now and then, for ten minutes. Push it 
to the back of the stove to cook slowly twenty minutes 
longer. 

Left-over farina may be made into a mold according 
to the directions for wheat germ. 

I consider farina souffle one of the nicest supper dishes 
for children or the aged. It takes the place of both bread 
and meat. 

FARINA SOUFFLE 
One Serving 

Put a half cupful of milk in the upper part of a double 
boiler; when hot add a grain of salt, and sprinkle in slowly 
two tablespoonfuls of farina ; stir until it thickens, cover and 
cook ten minutes. Take from the fire, drop in the yolk of 
one egg, mix, and then fold in quickly the well-beaten white 
of the egg. Turn this into a baking dish and bake in a mod- 
erately quick oven thirty minutes. 

Serve as a spoon bread and eat it with butter. 

GLUTEN MUSH 

All gluten preparations are quickly prepared, and while 
most of them contain a considerable amount of starch, they 
are much richer in protein than ordinary cereals. They are 
better served with cream than milk. Do not use sugar. 

To each half pint of water allow three tablespoonfuls of 
gluten flour. Sprinkle the dry flour slowly into cold water, 
stirring all the while ; stand the vessel in another of hot 
water, or use a double boiler ; cook twenty minutes and 
serve. 

COOKED, READY FOR SERVING 

We have in the markets of the United States an end- 
less variety of the so-called prepared cereals. Some are 
good, some middling, others totally worthless. To serve, 
put them in the oven a few minutes to renew their crisp- 
ness, and then they may be served with fruit juices, milk 
or cream. Avoid sugar. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 361 

FRUITS 

The sub-acid and sweet fruits mulberries, huckleber- 
ries, guavas, bananas, cantaloupes, watermelons, peaches, 
pears, apples and grapes, should be served quite cold. The 
acid fruits oranges, grape fruit, strawberries, raspberries, 
blackberries and currants, should be only moderately 
chilled; overchilling makes them sour and unpalatable. 

All fruits should be thoroughly washed in cold water. 
Grapes at serving time should be washed and served on finely 
chopped ice. 

To wash small fruits, put them in a colander, and lift 
the colander down and up several times in a pan of cold 
water. Wash strawberries before they are hulled. 

To serve fruit, use an appropriate dish, both in shape 
and color, and after the fruit is arranged garnish the dish 
with a fern or other appropriate green. A fresh rose at 
the side of a dish of strawberries is most attractive. A peach, 
apple or pear may be served on a dainty doily, on a pretty 
plate. 

The French, those wonderful people who know just 
how to cook and serve, use artificial leaves where fresh 
leaves cannot be obtained. To me, this is not attractive, 
but the beautiful is always to be considered when feeding 
the sick. 

Strawberries are dainty served with the hulls on. 
Arrange them around a little mound of powdered sugar, on 
a pretty dish. 

Serve all fruits without sugar, if possible. If they are 
too acid to be palatable, I should say they were too acid 
to be served. This is Nature's way of warning us against 
unwholesome foods. Moreover, sugar does not correct an 
acid ; it only disguises it so that it may pass the palate. The 
fruit and sugar enter the stomach in their original condition, 
the acid as an acid, and the sugar as sugar. A simple food 
has been complicated. 

Canned fruits are far better than no fruits at all, but 
are inferior to fresh fruits, not because they are cooked, 



362 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

but because they frequently contain a goodly quantity of 
added sugar. If fruits are too sour to be stewed without 
sugar, combine the sweet and the sour fruits in cooking. 
Good combinations are cranberries and raisins, cranberries 
and figs, cranberries and dates, currants and raspberries. 

Fruits, ripe and fresh, or simply stewed, should form a 
part of the daily food of persons in health ; in sickness they 
are a necessity. 

In fevers, fruit juices are the most essential and most 
appetizing of all foods ; orange and lemon juice are especially 
good. 

Fresh fruit juices in this country take the place of 
the old-fashioned German fruit soups, and are certainly 
much more palatable. In cases of biliousness, sick head- 
ache and fevers, all acid fruit juices, carefully strained, are 
admissible. In pupura hsemorrhagica, fresh grape juice 
is indispensable not the grape juice that one buys in a 
bottle that has been sterilized, but fresh pressed grapes ; the 
juice must be alive, not dead. In fevers, orange, lemon, 
lime, apple, currant and grape juice are to be preferred. 

A scraped apple, a fig, carefully masticated, or a half 
dozen raisins, seeded and masticated at bed time, will fre- 
quently cure obstinate constipation. 

Raw pineapple juice contains a digestive enzyme known 
as bromelin, which aids in the digestion of the albuminoids. 

Fresh raw pineapple juice is especially beneficial in 
cases of tonsilitis, membranous croup and diphtheria. 
Cooking of course, renders the enzymes inert. 

The papaya (Carica papaya) is a large tropical fruit of 
Central and South America. Like the pineapple, it contains 
an enzyme, which aids in the digestion of the albuminoids. 
In hot countries where meat must be eaten a few hours after 
it is killed, the piece to be used is wrapped in a bruised 
papaya leaf and put aside for two hours ; it is then tender 
and eatable ; in other words, the enzyme has partly digested 
the tough fiber.

them fresh each day. Keep the fruit in a cold place, mash 
and squeeze it as wanted.

The above tables show that the nutritive value of 
fruits consists of a small amount of nitrogenous matter, and 
a goodly quantity of sugar. They are valuable, however, 



364 MRS. RORER'S- DIET FOR THE SICK 

for the vegetable acids and salts they contain. Malic acid 
is found in apples, pears, peaches, apricots, currants, man- 
goes, gooseberries and plums ; tartaric acid in grapes ; and 
citric acid in all the citrus fruits ; they possess valuable anti- 
scorbutic properties. Some fruits contain agreeable aro- 
matic oils, others contain a large amount of pectin or 
vegetable jelly; the most important among the latter, are 
the guava, quince, banana, crab apple and the ordinary 
apple. 

APPLES 

'Tis said: "It beggars a physician to live where apple 
orchards thrive," and still many perfectly healthy persons 
claim they cannot digest a raw apple ; I do not believe, how- 
ever, that it is the fault of the apple. Many people bolt, 
rather than masticate, their food, and this renders the apple 
indigestible. Again, many persons take an apple after a 
hearty meal of other foods; this is a mistake. Fruits should 
be eaten alone, or as a part of the meal, not as an addition 
to the meal. Stale or tough, unripe, or cold storage apples 
will frequently produce digestive disorders. 

If apples are eaten raw, they must be thoroughly 
masticated or scraped, and eaten alone as a luncheon, or 
taken at the beginning of breakfast. In cases of constipa- 
tion, the apple is particularly beneficial ; it has a marked 
influence over the peristaltic movement of the intestines. 
Fresh apple juice is a liver and stomach tonic. 

A fresh apple contains about 84 to 86 per cent, of 
water, and 8 per cent, of sugar. 

TO BAKE AN APPLE 

Wash, wipe the apple, and with a sharp knife cut through 
the skin around the apple about an inch from the stem ; 
this prevents the skin from cracking, and keeps the apple 
in better shape ; remove the core with a sharp knife or 
an apple corer, stand the apple in a porcelain or granite 
dish, put a teaspoonful of sugar in the cored space, cover 
the bottom of the dish with water and bake in a moderately 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 365 

quick oven, basting once or twice. The apple must be 
perfectly tender, and should be served warm ; cold baked 
apples are indigestible. Omit sugar for children. 

BAKED PANNED APPLES 

Wash and core a good-sized tart apple, but do not pare 
it; cut it into halves, then into quarters, and cut each 
quarter into thin slices. Put a layer of apples and a 
sprinkling of sugar, and another layer of apples in the 
bottom of an individual casserole or ramekin dish, add 
four tablespoonfuls of water, cover the dish and bake in a 
hot oven about twenty minutes, until the apple is perfectly 
transparent and soft. 

Do not allow the patient to eat the skin, but apples 
cooked with the skin on have, by far, a better flavor. 

SMOTHERED APPLES 

Remove the core from a perfectly smooth tart apple; 
with a sharp knife cut the skin of the apple around at 
what might be called "the equator," fill the core space with 
sugar if admissible, stand it in an individual casserole or 
ramekin dish, add a quarter of a cupful of water, cover and 
bake slowly until the apple is almost transparent, about 
thirty to forty minutes. Serve warm. 

CODDLED APPLE 

Pare a good-sized tart apple and remove the core. Put 
the apple in an individual granite dish, put a teaspoonful 
of chopped nuts in the core space, add four tablespoon- 
fuls of water, cover the pan and cook in the oven until the 
apple is tender. Serve warm, plain or with thick cream, 
or Devonshire cream. 

APPLE TAPIOCA 

Coddle an apple according to the preceding recipe. 
While it is baking soak a tablespoonful of granulated 



366 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

tapioca in a half cupful of cold water, bring this to 
boiling point; the tapioca must be perfectly clear. Fill as 
much as is necessary into the core space of the coddled 
apple, cover the baking dish and bake five or ten minutes 
longer. Serve hot or cold, plain or with cream. 

This should be cooked in an individual casserole or 
ramekin dish, so that it can be served in the dish in which 
it is cooked. 

APPLE JUICE 

Procure perfectly fresh, sound apples, and plunge them 
for a minute into boiling water, then into cold water. Then 
put them into a small press, grind and press out every par- 
ticle of juice ; strain and put at once into a clean fruit jar, and 
keep in a cold place. 

A small inexpensive fruit press is made by the Enter- 
prise Manufacturing Company. 

APPLE a la ZOUAVE 

Grate half of a tart apple into a half cupful of good 
milk ; add a tablespoonful of sugar beaten with the yolk of 
one egg, and six blanched almonds, chopped or ground 
very fine; turn this into a custard cup, stand it in a pan of 
hot water and bake in a moderate oven until "set" in the 
center; test by putting a silver knife in the center, if it 
comes out milky, it is not done; it is just right when the 
knife comes out clean. Beat the white of the egg to a stiff 
froth, add a teaspoonful of powdered sugar and beat again. 
Spread this over the top of the custard, dust it with pow- 
dered sugar, and brown a moment in the oven. Serve cold. 

STEWED APPLES 

Pare, quarter and core one tart apple, put it in a granite 
saucepan, cover with cold water, cover the saucepan and 
bring quickly to a boil ; take from the fire and add two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. The apple should be quite trans- 
parent, and the pieces perfectly whole. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 367 

APPLE SAUCE 

Quarter and core two tart apples ; do not pare them. 
Put them in a granite saucepan, with a half cupful of cold 
water, cover the pan and bring quickly to a boil. Press 
through a sieve and serve warm. Add sugar, or not, as 
ordered. 

APPLE FLUFF 

Stir the well-beaten white of one egg into apple sauce 
after it has been pressed through a sieve and is still warm. 
This may be served hot or cold, plain or with cream. 

MARLBOROUGH APPLE SAUCE 

Press the pulp from one hot baked apple through a 
sieve, add to it, while hot, four tablespoonfuls of cream and 
the yolk of one egg. Heap this into a glass dish and serve. 



APPLE SNOW 

Beat the white of one egg until very, very stiff; grate 
into it a quarter of a tart apple ; mix quickly ; heap it into 
a glass lemonade cup, dust it with powdered sugar and 
serve. To give variety, the cup may be partly rilled with 
cold soft custard, or cream. 



LEMON APPLE 

Pare, core and quarter one good-sized apple. Put four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and six tablespoonfuls of water iri a 
saucepan, add a teaspoonful of the grating of yellow rind of a 
lemon, bring to a boil, skim, boil two- minutes, strain, return 
the syrup to the saucepan, add a tablespoonful of lemon juice 
and the apple, cover the saucepan and stand it on the back 
of the stove, where it cannot possibly boil, until the apple is 
tender and clear. 



368 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

GRILLED APPLES 

Shell two large or four small chestnuts, remove the 
brown skin, throw them into salted water and boil care- 
fully until they are tender; drain. Take the core from 
one tart apple; do not pare it. Cut two good slices, a half 
inch thick, from the center of the apple, put these on a 
wire broiler and broil carefully over a clear fire, five min- 
utes, until they are tender. Dish them on a heated plate, 
put one large or two small chestnuts in the center of each ; 
stand them in the oven a minute while you boil together 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar and six tablespoonfuls of water. 
As soon as the sugar and water have boiled, skim and add 
a level teaspoonful of cornstarch moistened in a tablespoon- 
ful of water, boil a minute, add a dash of lemon juice and 
baste it over the apples. 

APPLE OMELET 

Beat one egg, without separating, until well mixed ; 
add a tablespoonful of powdered sugar and the soft portion 
from one baked apple. Put a tablespoonful of olive oil into 
a shallow pan, and when hot turn in the egg mixture, brown 
quickly and stand in the oven a moment until set ; fold 
over, turn on to a small heated platter, dust with powdered 
sugar and serve at once. 

SCALLOPED APPLE 

Stew one apple. Roll and sift sufficient dry bread to 
make four tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs. Put the stewed 
apple in an individual casserole or baking dish, dust over 
the bread crumbs, dust the top lightly with sugar and bake 
in a moderate oven about twenty minutes. Serve warm, 
plain or with cream. 

APPLE SPONGE 

Wash and core one tart apple, cut it into slices; put it 
in a saucepan with a half cupful of cold water, bring to a 
boil, add two tablespoonfuls of .sugar, a teaspoonful of 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 369 

lemon juice and a teaspoonful of gelatin that has been 
soaked for a half hour in two tablespoonfuls of cold water. 
When the gelatin is dissolved, press the whole through a 
sieve, and pour while hot into the beaten white of one egg. 
Turn into an individual mold and stand aside to harden. 
Serve with plain or whipped cream, or a soft custard made 
from the yolk of the egg and a half cupful of milk. 

FROSTED APPLE 

Pare one nice tart apple, core and stand it in an indi- 
vidual baking dish ; fill the core space with a teaspoonful 
of granulated sugar, add a half cupful of water, cover and 
bake until the apple is perfectly tender. Beat the white of 
one egg until light and dry, add a level tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar, and beat again. Take the apple from the 
oven, cover it thickly with the meringue, dust with pow- 
dered sugar and return to the oven until a golden brown. 
Serve hot or cold. 

YORKSHIRE APPLE 

Cook an apple according to the preceding recipe, filling 
the core space with orange marmalade instead of sugar. 
Serve warm. 

APPLE WITH QUINCE JELLY 

Cook an apple as directed for frosted apple. Fill the 
core space with quince jelly. Serve warm or cold, plain or 
with cream. 

BRANDY APPLE 

Pare a large tart apple, remove the core, stand the 
apple in a baking dish or individual casserole mold, fill the 
core space with orange marmalade, add a half cupful of 
water, cover the mold and bake slowly until the apple is 
tender. Soak a tablespoonful of gelatin in two tablespoon- 
fuls of water, add a tablespoonful of sugar, two tablespoon- 
fuls of brandy and a half cupful of boiling water; stir until 
the gelatin is dissolved and stand aside to cool, not harden. 

24 



370 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

When the apple is done, remove it from the baking dish, 
and when partly cool baste it with the brandy jelly, and 
keep on basting until the apple is thoroughly coated with 
the jelly. Serve plain, or with plain or whipped cream. 

APPLE SALAD 

Pare and core one perfect tart apple. Sprinkle over 
the apple a tablespoonful of lemon juice, mix thoroughly 
until each piece is covered; this will prevent discoloration. 
Put a saltspoonful of salt in a bowl, add to it a half drop 
of Tabasco, two tablespoonfuls of oil and a half tablespoon- 
ful of lemon juice or vinegar; mix, baste this over the 
apple, heap it neatly on a little nest of crisp lettuce leaves 
and serve at once. If admissible, the apple may be mixed 
with very tender young celery. To make it more attractive 
the apple may be scooped from the fresh red skin and the 
salad served in the skin. To prevent the inside of the skin 
from discoloration, wash it thoroughly with lemon juice. 

APRICOTS 

To serve fresh apricots, wipe the skin thoroughly, stand 
them in a cold place until slightly chilled, and dish on a 
dainty doily. Serve also a finger bowl and fruit knife. 
The skin must be removed before eating. 

\ 

APRICOT PUREE 

This makes a very nice sauce for any of the gelatin 
jellies, mock charlotte, or to plain blancmange. 

Wash two apricots, cut them into halves, remove the 
stones, put them in a saucepan with a half cupful of cold 
water, bring quickly to boiling point, add a teaspoonful of 
cornstarch moistened in a little cold water, and two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar; boil just a minute until the cornstarch 
is thoroughly cooked, and press them through a sieve. This 
should be as thick as very thick cream ; if too thick add a 
tablespoonful or two of hot water. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 371 

APRICOT TOAST 

Make a puree of apricot according to preceding recipe. 
Cut a slice from a square loaf of bread, trim off the crusts, 
dry the bread in the oven, toast it quickly on one side, then 
on the other, put it at once on a heated small dish and 
cover it with apricot puree. 

This is exceedingly nice for a child's breakfast. If not 
convenient to make toast, put it over the upper crust of a 
shredded wheat biscuit. 

APRICOT SOUFFLE 

Make a puree of apricot according to the first recipe, 
pour it while hot into the well-beaten white of one egg. 
Dish at once in a pretty individual glass stem dish or 
lemonade cup, dust with powdered sugar and stand aside 
to cool. 

BANANAS 

There are many varieties of bananas grown in Central 
and South America that are not exported. The one best 
known in the United States is the Gross Michael ; I have 
noticed, however, in the markets of New York large 
quantities of the ordinary red banana, and a yellow banana, 
short and thick like the red one, known as the Congp, and 
a white, thick banana, the Governor "fig," also known in 
some parts of South America as the apple "fig." All 
bananas are known to the natives in the districts where 
bananas grow, as Indian "figs." The word banana, how- 
ever, is always applied to the red banana. 

Bananas are, without doubt, the most nutritious of all 
fruits in common use. They should not, however, be given 
to the sick or children unless they are thoroughly and- 
simply cooked. The so-called "lady fingers" or Gross 
Michaels are best for cooking. 

Banana flour is made from underripe bananas, thor- 
oughly dried and ground. It is exceedingly good for dia- 
betic, rheumatic and gouty patients. It may be made into 
mush, or gems, or small cakes. 



372 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

BAKED BANANAS 

Take the banana out of the skin by stripping off one 
piece and then lifting it out. If you strip the skin down 
you are very apt to leave the bitter portion fast to the 
fruit. Put the banana into an earthen or granite baking 
dish, brush it with a tablespoonful of olive oil, dust it with 
a teaspoonful of granulated sugar and bake in a quick oven 
thirty minutes. Bananas to be just right should be a golden 
brown and very tender. Serve warm. 

SCALLOPED BANANA 

Peel the banana and cut it into thin slices with a silver 
knife. Put a layer in the bottom of individual casserole or 
ramekin dish, a little dusting- of sugar, another layer of 
banana, and so continue until you have the ingredients 
used. Bake thirty minutes in a moderately quick oven. 

BANANA SOUFFLE 

Select a full ripe banana, skin and mash it ; put it in 
a saucepan with a tablespoonful of orange juice and a 
tablespoonful of sugar. When hot fold into it carefully the 
well-beaten white of one egg. Serve cold. 

BANANA MUSH 

This is made from banana flour, which is easily digested 
and very agreeable. It frequently contains just a trace of 
glucose. 

Put a half cupful of water into a saucepan, when boiling 
add two tablespoonfuls of milk. Moisten two teaspoonfuls 
of banana flour, stir it into the hot milk and water, bring 
to a boil, and take from the fire. The flavoring of this may 
be changed by adding a little orange or lemon juice, by 
making the gruel entire milk, or entire water. Serve with 
cream. 

This is an exceedingly nice mush for. delicate children 
or invalids, but is not a good food for diabetic patients 
unless a starch-free flour is used. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 373 

BANANA PUFF 

Separate one egg, beat the yolk with a tablespoonful 
of powdered sugar. Peel and slice a ripe banana, put it 
in a saucepan and stir it constantly over hot water until 
thoroughly heated, mash and add the yolk and sugar, cook a 
minute longer, fold in the well-beaten white ; heap it in rame- 
kin or individual dish, dust with powdered sugar and bake in 
a quick oven until a golden brown. A nice breakfast for a 
child, or an invalid or the aged. 

STEWED BANANAS 

Peel a banana, cut it in slices a half inch thick using 
a silver knife ; put it in a saucepan with four tablespoon- 
fuls of cold water and a teaspoonful of orange or lemon 
juice; cover and bring quickly to a boil. Serve warm or 
cold. 

BANANA CHARLOTTE 

Stew the bananas according to the preceding recipe, 
and beat with a silver fork until light ; stand aside to cool. 
When cool, add two tablespoonfuls of sherry instead of the 
lemon, and stir in carefully six tablespoonfuls of cream, 
whipped to a stiff froth. Serve in a pretty stem glass 
dish. 

BLACKBERRIES 

When fully ripe, blackberries, like raspberries, do not 
contain as much free acid as currants or cranberries. In 
cordial, syrup, jelly and jam, they give variety to the diet 
in cases of chronic diarrhoea. 

In vinegar or wine the blackberry makes a pleasant, 
cooling drink for convalescents. 

Blackberries and dewberries are laxative only when 
eaten raw. 

TO SERVE RAW 

Select large, fully ripe blackberries, arrange them 
neatly in a fruit dish, dust with powdered sugar, stand 
them in a cold place for ten minutes and serve. 



374 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Fully ripe large berries have a core, which the patient 
must not swallow. 

BLACKBERRY MUSH 

Put a half cupful of very ripe blackberries in a sauce- 
pan with a half cupful of water, bring to boiling point, add 
one teaspoonful of arrowroot moistened in a little cold 
water; cook slowly five minutes, add one tablespoonful of 
sugar and press the mixture through a fine sieve. Put 
into an individual dish for cooling. Serve plain, or with 
cream. 

BLACKBERRY FLUFF 

Press sufficient full ripe blackberries through a fine 
sieve, to make a half cupful of clear juice. Bring to boil- 
ing point, boil a minute, add one tablespoonful of sugar, 
and pour while hot into the well-beaten white of one egg. 
Heap at once into a lemonade cup and stand aside to cool. 

BLACKBERRY JELLY 

Press sufficient underripe blackberries through a sieve 
to make one cupful of juice. Bring the juice to a boil, boil 
three minutes, add an equal quantity of sugar, boil about 
five minutes, until the mixture will jelly when cool. Turn 
into small serving glasses and stand in the refrigerator. 
The jelly must be soft and delicate, not tough. 

BLACKBERRY SHRUB 

Press sufficient very ripe blackberries through a sieve 
to half fill a tumbler; siphon into this either soda or plain 
carbonated water; or if a siphon is out of the question, add a 
split of Apollinaris, and serve at once. 

This makes an exceedingly nice drink in cases of chronic 
diarrhoea. 

BLACKBERRY SYRUP 

Squeeze sufficient slightly-heated, very ripe blackber- 
ries to make one pint of juice. Boil one pound of white 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 375 

rock candy with a pint of water for ten minutes, add the 
juice, boil five minutes, bottle while hot and seal. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL I 

Heat four quarts of blackberries, stirring them all the 
while ; do not add water. Mash the berries and strain 
them through two thicknesses of cheesecloth, pressing out 
all the juice. Measure the juice, put it in a preserving 
kettle, add to each quart of juice, one pound of sugar, ten 
whole allspice, two cloves, and an inch piece of cinnamon. 
Bring to a boil, boil fifteen minutes, take from the fire, 
and when cool add one gill of brandy to each quart. Bottle 
in perfectly clean bottles, cork and seal. 

If good brandy cannot be purchased, use the best rye 
or Bourbon whiskey. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL II 

Mash and squeeze sufficient blackberries to make one 
quart of juice ; stir in one pound of granulated sugar. -Tie 
a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, the same of allspice, 
the same of ginger and a saltspoonful of cloves into a little 
square of cheesecloth ; put it into the juice, bring to a boil 
and boil twenty minutes. Strain through two thicknesses 
of cheesecloth, and when cold add a half pint of brandy. 
Bottle and cork. 

TO SERVE CORDIAL 

Put two ounces into an ordinary tumbler and fill the 
tumbler with cool, plain water. Or serve two ounces plain, 
in a wineglass. Good in dysentery and diarrhoea. 

BLACKBERRY VINEGAR 

Put two quarts of ripe blackberries into a stone jar, 
pour over one quart of good cider vinegar, cover the jar 
and stand aside for two days. Drain off the liquor without 
mashing the berries, pour it over a quart of fresh berries, 
cover and stand aside as before. Do this once more, using 



376 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

fresh berries each time, this time straining through two 
thicknesses of cheesecloth. Measure the liquor, and add 
one pound of sugar to each pint. Boil slowly five minutes, 
skim, let it stand a minute to cool, fill it into clean bottles, 
cork and seal. 

This makes a cooling drink in hot weather for convales- 
cents or fever patients. 

BLACKBERRY BRANDY 

I quart of very ripe blackberries 12 whole allspice 

I clove 2 pounds of loaf sugar 

I pint of water I quart of good brandy 
An inch piece of cinnamon 

Mash the berries and strain them through two thick- 
nesses of cheesecloth. Boil the sugar and water ten min- 
utes, add the syrup to the juice, add all the spices and one 
quart of good brandy; stand the mixture away in fruit 
jars, lightly covered, for at least two weeks. Strain, bottle, 
cork and seal. 

BLACKBERRY JUICE 

Mash wild blackberries, bring them to boiling point 
and drain over night. Next morning put the juice in a pre- 
serving kettle; boil five minutes and skim; fill it into 
bottles, leaving a two-inch space in the neck; cork and 
put them, on their sides, in a wash boiler, with enough hot 
water to cover. Boil a half hour, and allow them to cool 
in the water. When cold dip the corks in sealing wax. 

BLACKBERRYADE 

Mash one cupful of ripe berries, strain through cheese- 
cloth, add two teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar, stir until 
the sugar is dissolved, put the mixture in a large tumbler, 
add a little cracked ice, and fill the tumbler with carbonated 
or plain water. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 377 

BLACKBERRY BOUNCE 

Put one quart of very ripe blackberries in a granite or 
porcelain-lined kettle, add a half cupful of water, cover the 
kettle and when hot stir until the blackberries are thor- 
oughly heated; press them through a sieve sufficiently 
fine to take out the seeds. Add to this pulp ten lumps of 
Domino sugar and a half pint of boiling water. Boil two 
minutes, take from the fire, bottle, cork and stand aside in a 
cold place. At serving time put four tablespoonfuls of this 
in a wineglass or small tumbler, and add a tablespoonful of 
brandy. 

The patient must sip this slowly. Good as a mild 
stimulant for tuberculosis and chronic diarrhoea patients. 

Raspberry bounce is made precisely the same as black- 
berry bounce. Red and black raspberries may be mixed, 
or each used alone. 

Dewberries may be used the same as blackberries. 

CHERRIES 

The cherry, on account of its tough, indigestible skin 
and solid fruit, plays little or no part in diet for the sick. 
The sour morello cherry, when fully ripe, is the least objec- 
tionable of all varieties. 

< 

CHERRY JUICE 

Put a quart of morello cherries into an ordinary granite 
or porcelain kettle, add a half cupful of boiling water, stir 
over the fire until they are boiling hot, take from the fire, 
mash with an ordinary pestle, and strain through two thick- 
nesses of cheesecloth ; cool at once. 

Cherry juice may be substituted for orange, currant 
or raspberry juice as a cooling and refreshing drink. 

Cherries and cherry juice contains too much free acid 
to be used with starchy foods or milk. Such combinations 
quickly upset digestion. 



378 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

In fever cases cherry juice may be substituted for 
orange juice as a base for the beaten white of an egg, or 
use it as a flavoring in gelatin jellies. 

Morello cherries, if the skins are rejected, will fre- 
quently relieve obstinate constipation. 

CRANBERRIES 

This fruit contains too much free acid to be used in any 
great quantity, unless so ordered by a physician. For 
convalescing patients, where admissible, they may be made 
into jelly, or may be stewed or baked. Baked cranberries 
are considered valuable in cases of chronic constipation. 

BAKED CRANBERRIES 

Wash a half pint of perfect cranberries, put them into 
a baking dish, add a half pint of sugar, mix thoroughly, 
cover the dish and bake in a moderate oven until the cran- 
berries are perfectly tender and transparent. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE 

Wash a half pint of perfectly sound cranberries, add 
a half pint of water, bring quickly to a boil and press 
through a sieve. Return them to the saucepan, add a half 
pint of sugar, bring to a boil and stand aside to cool. 

CRANBERRY AND APPLE SAUCE 

Pare, core and quarter a small tart apple, put it in a 
saucepan with a half pint of sound cranberries, add a half 
pint of water, bring to a boil, boil five minutes and press 
through a sieve ; add a half pint of sugar, stir over the fire 
until the sugar is dissolved, and stand aside to cool. 

CRANBERRY JELLY 

Wash a half pint of solid, perfect cranberries, put them 
in a saucepan with a gill (a half cupful) of cold water, 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK , 379 

bring to boiling point, boil five minutes and press through 
a sieve. Return them to the saucepan, boil two minutes, 
add an equal quantity of sugar, and when the sugar is 
dissolved boil one minute and turn into small molds or 
glasses to harden. 

FROZEN CRANBERRYADE 

Put half a pint of fully ripe cranberries in a pint of 
water, boil for five minutes, mash and strain through two 
thicknesses of cheesecloth, and stand aside to cool. 

When wanted for use, put the desired quantity into an 
individual freezer, pack with fine salt and ice, and turn the 
freezer until the mixture is frozen like wet snow. 

This is very refreshing to fever patients, but should be 
used in small quantities, as one would use any acid sherbet. 

CURRANTS 

Currants, gooseberries and wineberries are remarkable 
for the amount of free acid they contain. The expressed 
juices of these fruits make an agreeable addition to effer- 
vescent waters. Currants eaten raw at the beginning of 
a meal, either plain or with sugar, are good in cases of 
chronic constipation. 

Currant jelly is one of the most palatable and attractive 
of all fruit jellies, and may be served with meats, or in 
the absence of fresh currants, may be dissolved in boiling 
water, cooled and used with effervescing waters in cases 
of fever. 

FROSTED CURRANTS 

Select large bunches of full ripe currants. Beat one 
e gg slightly, add ten grains of cream of tartar, then add 
gradually, beating all the while, sufficient powdered sugar 
to make an icing, about eight tablespoonfuls to the white 
of one egg. Wash the currants and see that they are per- 
fectly dry; dip them, or rather push them down into this 
icing, and dry them on a sieve, putting them upside down 



380 - MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

if possible, so the currants will stand out from the stem 
and be thoroughly iced all over. Serve on a small glass 
dish, for breakfast or luncheon. There is no food value 
particularly in a bunch of currants, but they make one of 
the most attractive dishes for invalids; they are dainty, 
sightly and appetizing. 

CURRANT SHRUB 

Strip sufficient red currants from the stems to make a 
half pint; put them in a saucepan with a quarter of a cup- 
ful of water, cover the saucepan and bring to boiling point. 
Press them through a sieve or strain through two thick- 
nesses of cheesecloth, and stand aside until wanted. At 
serving time put one gill of this juice in a tumbler, and 
siphon the tumbler full of either seltzer or carbonated 
water, or Apollinaris. 

BLACK CURRANTS 

These are entirely different from red currants, both in 
taste and food value. The juice of black currants may be 
expressed the same as red currants, and used as a "shrub," 
or may be made into jelly to serve with game or red meats. 

CURRANTS AND RASPBERRIES 

The expressed juice of red currants, with an equal quan- 
tity of raspberry juice, makes an exceedingly nice beverage 
when diluted with Apollinaris or with carbonated water. 

These fruit waters are useful in fevers, and are espe- 
cially desirable where lime or lemon juice cannot be 
obtained. 

DATES (Phoenix dactylifera) 

Dates are the fruit of a palm. They frequently con- 
tain half their weight in sugar, and a goodly amount of 
flesh-forming elements. With bread and butter, or with 
milk and bread and butter, they make an exceedingly good 
meal for children. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 381 

To cleanse Take off the desired quantity, pull them 
apart, put them in a colander, plunge them quickly into a 
bowl of boiling water, then into cold water, and throw 
them on a towel to dry. Sterilize enough one day to last 
for a week. Candy-eating children may be cured of the 
habit by substituting dates for candy. 

According to Church, one pound, without stones, con- 
tains the following: 

Water 3 oz. 143 gr. 

Albuminoids, etc I oz. 25 gr. 

Sugar 8 oz. 280 gr. 

Pectose and gum i oz. 354 gr. 

Fat o oz. 14 gr. 

Cellulose o oz. 385 gr. 

Mineral matter o oz. 1 12 gr. 

STUFFED DATES 

Plunge the dates into boiling water, remove the stones 
and put in their places either half of a pecan or an almond, 
or a mixture of chopped nuts or another stoned date. 

DATE MUFFIN 

Scald and stone the dates and put them through a 
meat grinder. Separate two eggs, add to the yolks one 
cupful of milk and one and a half cupfuls of whole wheat 
flour; beat thoroughly, add a half cupful of the chopped 
dates and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder; when well 
mixed fold in the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in 
ten shallow muffin pans. 

DATE MUSH 

Stir finely-chopped dates into well-cooked oatmeal, at 
serving time. 

DATE SANDWICHES 

Stone and chop a half dozen dates. Butter two thin 
slices of bread, put the dates between, press them together, 
trim the crusts, cut into triangles and serve. 



382 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



Put a quarter of a pound of dates in a wire basket, 
plunge them down into boiling water, lift quickly, remove 
the stones and cut the dates rather fine. Separate two 
eggs, beat the yolks, add a half pint of milk, a quarter of 
a teaspoonful of salt and one cupful of whole wheat flour 
and one cupful of Roman meal ; beat thoroughly, add two 
level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, beat, add the dates, 
mix and stir in carefully the well-beaten whites of the eggs. 
Bake in gem pans, in a quick oven thirty minutes. 

These, with milk, make an exceedingly nice supper for 
children. 

ELDERBERRIES 

Elderberry juice, wine or cordial is said to have a 
slightly diuretic effect. Elderberry jelly is thought to be 
beneficial in cases of tuberculosis. To make a perfectly stiff 
jelly, however, the elderberry juice must be mixed with an 
equal quantity of green grape, apple or crab apple juice. 
Alone, it will not form a true jelly. 



Strip sufficient elderberries from the stem to make a 
half pint, put them in a saucepan with a half cupful of 
water, stew five minutes, mash and strain them through 
two thicknesses of cheesecloth. Return this juice to the 
saucepan, add one teaspoonful of cornstarch or arrowroot 
mixed with a little cold water; stir and cook five minutes, 
add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and pour over a nicely 
toasted slice of bread. 

This also makes a nice sauce for blancmange or other 
puddings. 

ELDERBERRY CORDIAL 

Strip the elderberries from the stems, mash them with 
a potato masher and strain them through a jelly bag or 
cheesecloth. To each half pint of this juice add two table- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 383 

spoonfuls of sugar, stir until the sugar is dissolved and 
stand aside in a pitcher or large jar for twenty-four hours. 
Then, add to each half pint, one gill of the best brandy. 
Bottle and cork, leaving plenty of space at the neck ; stand 
the bottles in a saucepan of cold water, bring to boiling 
point and boil continuously for a half hour. Lift the lid, 
let the bottles cool in the water. Dip each cork into sealing 
wax and stand aside for keeping. 

This makes an exceedingly nice drink for chronic 
diarrhoea or dysentery. Being slightly astringent, it should 
not be given to persons inclined to constipation. 

ELDERBERRY WINE 

Mash four quarts of elderberries that have been stripped 
from the stems; add to them one quart of water and one 
pint of brown sugar, stir thoroughly and put it aside in a 
stone crock, the top of which is covered with a plate or 
loose fitting lid. Let this ferment for a week or ten days. 
Rack it off carefully into bottles, cork the bottles loosely 
and let them stand in a cold place until fermentation ceases; 
then put it 'into clean bottles, cork, tie and seal with wax. 

ELDERBERRY JUICE 

Mash four quarts of elderberries, add one pint of water 
and strain through two thicknesses of cheesecloth. Fill 
the juice thus expressed into bottles, leaving considerable 
space at the neck; cork the bottles loosely, stand them in 
a kettle, surround them partly with cold water, bring to 
a boil and boil continuously for a half hour. Then lift each 
bottle, push in the corks, put them on their sides and con- 
tinue the boiling for another thirty minutes. Cool the 
bottles in the water. Seal with wax. 

Serve plain or with plain or carbonated water. 

FIGS 

Figs, both fresh and dried, contain a large amount of 
sugar; dried figs about forty-nine per cent. They also 



384 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

contain a little nitrogenous matter, which makes them much 
more nutritious than most of our common fruits. Both 
fresh and dried they are aperient. 

If dried figs become hard, they may be scalded and 
soaked three or four hours, or over night. Dried figs must 
be thoroughly masticated; in fact, it is better, if the skin 
is tough, to reject it entirely. 

TO SERVE DRY FIGS 

Purchase the so-called pulled figs, put them in a wire 
basket, plunge them into a kettle of boiling water to thor- 
oughly sterilize the outside. If you have not a wire basket, 
put them on an egg beater, a few at a time, and hold them 
in the water for at least two minutes; lift and throw them 
on a plate to drain. Serve on a dainty plate, with a fruit 
knife and fork. 



Buy, a few figs at a time, and put them at once in a 
cold place to keep. At serving time fill a small individual 
serving dish with cracked ice, sink the figs in the ice, stem 
end up. These are rich and luscious, and must be handled 
very lightly. 

STEAMED FIGS 

Wash the given amount of pulled figs in cold water, 
let them soak for two hours ; place them in a colander, over 
a kettle of boiling water, steam continuously for three 
quarters of an hour and stand aside to cool. These may be 
cut into pieces and eaten with a fork, or they may be 
eaten from the fingers. 

STEWED FIGS 

Wash a half pound of pulled figs, cover with a pint of 
water and soak them over night. Next morning bring 
to boiling point, add a bay leaf, cover the saucepan and 
push it to the back of the stove where it will keep boiling hot 
for one hour. Serve cold, plain or with cream. 



. MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 385 

FIG TOAST 

Put two stewed figs through a meat grinder, then into 
a saucepan with four tablespoonfuls of water, and stir con- 
stantly until they reach the boiling point. Have ready on 
a breakfast plate a slice of bread, toasted to a golden brown 
and buttered; put over the fig mixture and serve at once, 
with cream or milk. 

This takes the place of fruit and cereal, and is an excel- 
lent remedy for obstinate constipation. It makes a good 
supper as well as a good breakfast dish. 

FAIRY TOAST 

Toast a slice of sponge cake, cover it with the fig mix- 
ture and serve with cream or milk. 

FIG CARAMELS 

Soak a half pound of pulled figs over night. Next 
morning bring to boiling point, boil five minutes and drain. 
Put them through a meat grinder. Blanch a half pound 
of Jordan almonds, put them through a meat grinder, and 
mix the two together. Knead the same as bread, roll the 
mixture into a sheet a half inch thick, cut into "caramels," 
wrap each in waxed paper and keep in a cool place. 

These make a nice "candy" for children. Two, slowly 
eaten, just before going to bed, will relieve obstinate con- 
stipation. 

FIGS AND ALMONDS ON TOAST 

Wash, scald and soak two figs over night ; next morn- 
ing put them through the meat grinder with twenty-four 
blanched almonds. Add two tablespoonfuls of water, or 
enough to make it the consistency of a thick sauce ; spread 
it on a slice of hot buttered toast; eat plain or with milk. 
An excellent breakfast for school children.

386 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

FIG SANDWICHES 

Use the same mixture as above, without water, be- 
tween two slices of bread and butter. 

GRAPES 

Fresh ripe grapes are enjoyed mostly on account of 
their flavor and aroma. They are rich in sugar, frequently 
containing nearly twenty per cent., but this is not more im- 
portant than the potash salts they contain. The acid is 
chiefly tartaric, a part of which is combined with the 
potash. The seedless grape, such as the black Hamburg, is 
an excellent food for children and invalids. The white and 
purple California grapes, with the seeds removed, are equally 
palatable and wholesome. 

Grapes, on account of their sugar, are forbidden to 
diabetic, rheumatic and gouty patients. The ordinary Con- 
cord or similar grapes must be very carefully eaten. If the 
pulp is to be swallowed, the seeds must be removed be- 
tween the teeth, and the rich juice on the inside of the 
skin should be drawn out, and both skin and seeds discarded, 
as they hinder digestion and frequently cause diarrhoea. 

A special grape cure has been established in many 
grape-growing countries, but the fact is that almost any 
restricted diet will cure stomach or liver trouble and aid in 
the removal of chronic constipation, if the patient will 
adhere to it for a given length of time. It matters not so 
much whether the "cure" is the "peach," "grape," or "apple 
cure ;" the point is to put the patient on a limited diet until 
a cure is effected; patients with these troubles are fre- 
quently large eaters. Restricted feedings of all kinds must 
be prescribed and carried out under the eye of a physician 
and a trained nurse or attendant. 

The fruit of some varieties of grapes are dried and 
known as raisins ; these are very rich in sugar. The 
ordinary dried "currants" are merely dried small grapes ; 
they are indigestible and should not be given to the sick. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 387 

TO SERVE RAW 

Wash the grapes as soon as they come from the market, 
and put them in a cold place. At serving time fill either 
a grape goblet or an individual dessert plate with finely- 
shaved ice, put the bunch of grapes down into the ice, stand 
on a service plate and serve with them on the same tray 
a finger bowl partly filled with warm water. 

\ 
GRAPE JUICE 

Pick the quantity of ripe Catawba or Concord grapes 
from the stems, put them into the preserving kettle 
with water enough to prevent scorching, and stir and cook 
until soft. Mash them with a potato masher and put them 
into a jelly bag to drain over night. Next morning bring the 
juice to boiling point and skim. Have the bottles ready, 
cleaned, and clean corks. Fill the juice into the bottles, 
leaving a space at the necks ; cork them tightly and drop 
them at once into a boiler of hot water. When the last bottle 
is in, cover the boiler and boil continuously for a half hour. 
Cool the bottles in the water, dip the corks in sealing wax 
and put them in a cool place for keeping. 

GRAPE JUICE WITH SUGAR 

Strain the juice according to preceding recipe ; meas- 
ure, and to each quart allow a half pint of sugar. Boil the 
juice, skim, add the sugar, stir until the sugar is dissolved, 
bottle and finish as directed in preceding recipe. 

FRESH GRAPE JUICE I 

This is considered very beneficial in cases of purpura 
haemorrhagica. 

Pick from the stems sufficient grapes to make a quart; 
pulp them and put the skins through either a meat grinder 
or an ordinary fruit press and strain the juice through cheese- 
cloth. This expressed juice is quite thick. Keep in a cold 
place until wanted. 



388 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Two ounces may be given every three or four hours, 
between feedings. If the grapes are fully ripe, it will take 
one quart of grapes to make a half pint of juice. 

FRESH GRAPE JUICE II 

Pulp Concord or other black grapes; save the skins. 
Heat the pulp just a minute, press it through a sieve, cool 
quickly, then add the skins, and put the whole through an 
ordinary meat grinder or regular fruit press. A large lemon 
squeezer will answer if no other machine is at hand. 

GRAPE JAM 

Pick sufficient Concord grapes from the stems to make 
one quart; wash them, pulp the grapes, saving the skins. 
Put the seeds and pulp in a saucepan, bring to boiling point 
and press them through a sieve. Add the skins to this ; 
measure, and to each pint allow a half pint of sugar. Put 
the skin mixture in a saucepan, stir and cook until the skins 
are tender, then press them through a sieve sufficiently fine 
to make a soft pulp, and sufficiently coarse to allow all the 
skin to go through. Bring to boiling point, add the sugar, 
boil twenty minutes, and put into tumblers or jars. 

FRESH GRAPE JELLY 

Freshly made jelly is much more acceptable to the in- 
valid; old jelly, unless carefully covered, is apt to taste 
musty. 

Pick a pint of grapes from the stem, put them in a 
kettle with a little water to prevent scorching, bring to 
boiling point, mash them and strain through two thick- 
nesses 'of cheesecloth. Measure the liquor; you should 
have a half pint; put it in a saucepan, bring to boiling 
point, boil ten minutes, add a half pint of sugar, boil ten 
minutes and begin to try. As soon as it forms a jelly when 
cool, turn it into small stem glasses and stand aside to cool, 
or cool it into small fancy molds. 



MRS. RORER S DIET FOR THE SICK 

GRAPE WATER ICE 

Sweeten and freeze ordinary grape juice. 

GRAPES IN ORANGE JELLY 

Cover two teaspoonfuls of granulated gelatin with a half 
cupful of cold water, soak twenty minutes ; stir over the fire 
until the gelatin is dissolved ; add an equal quantity of 
orange juice and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and stand 
aside to cool, but not thicken. Skin twelve large, white 
grapes, cut them into halves, remove the seeds, arrange the 
grapes neatly in an individual mold, pour over the orange 
jelly and stand aside to harden. 

GRAPE TOAST 

Boil together four tablespoonfuls of grape juice and 
two tablespoonfuls of water, add a teaspoonful of cornstarch 
or arrowroot moistened in a little cold water, a teaspoonful 
of lemon juice and a tablespoonful of sugar. Pour this over 
a slice of nicely-toasted bread and serve at once. Or in 
place of toast use the upper half of a toasted Shredded Wheat 
biscuit. 

RAISINS 

Raisins are a dried sweet grape known as the "raisin 
grape." They contain more sugar than ordinary grapes, 
and have no place whatever in diet for the sick except as 
flavoring to milk dishes. 

Layer raisins, seeded, or the ordinary seedless raisins, 
carefully stewed, may be used to advantage in cases of 
chronic constipation, and in winter they may be used as 
a breakfast fruit for children, providing the children have 
been taught to masticate. They should be well washed and 
soaked over night before cooking. 

STEWED RAISINS 

Put a pound of seeded raisins into a colander in a bowl 
of cold water, wash thoroughly, lift them, put them in 



390 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

a saucepan with just boiling 1 water to cover; cover and 
stand aside over night. Next morning the water should 
be absorbed by the raisins. Add a little more water, bring 
slowly to boiling point, take quickly from the fire and 
turn out to cool. I)o not add sugar or flavoring. 

RAISINS AND RICE 

Children frequently like boiled rice and raisins as a 
dessert or luncheon dish. 

Boil the rice carefully as directed for boiling rice, and 
cover it with seeded stewed raisins. The raisins are suffi- 
ciently sweet to sweeten the rice without additional sugar. 

GRAPE FRUIT AND SHADDOCK 

Grape fruit closely resembles the shaddock, and is 
called "grape fruit" because it grows in clusters like grapes, 
while the shaddock and alemoen grow singly. The skin 
surrounding each carpel in the shaddock instead of being 
white like other citrus fruit is pale pink ; the pulp is also 
pink, and unlike grape fruit, is only moderately acid. 

TO SERVE GRAPE FRUIT 

Wash the grape fruit and stand them on the ice until 
moderately cold. Acid fruits must not be icy cold, or they 
are unpalatable. Cut the skin into strips and peel it off. 
Separate the carpels, and holding each carpel in the hand, 
break it open, disclosing the pulp ; with a pointed knife take 
the pulp carefully from the bitter envelope, put it into an 
individual glass dish, and serve it at once ; or it may be 
placed on the ice until wanted. 

GRAPE FRUIT IN THE HALF SHELL 

Wash the grape fruit, make it moderately cold, plunge 
it into boiling water and cut it at once into halves. With a 
sharp knife take out the seeds and loosen the flesh of each 
carpel. Serve plain or with sugar; without sugar they are 
decidedly more wholesome. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 391 

GRAPE FRUIT FOR LUNCHEON 

Proceed according to the foregoing recipe ; remove the 
seeds and cut out the core. Fill the core space with brandy 
or sherry, according to directions. 

GRAPE FRUIT FOR THE DIABETIC 

Remove the seeds and core, space from a perfectly 
sound grape fruit; put into the core space two teaspoon- 
fuls of olive oil, and serve. 

People can soon accustom themselves to eating grape 
fruit with olive oil. It is wholesome and palatable. 

GRAPE FRUIT SALAD 

Remove the carpels from the grape fruit according to 
the directions for serving grape fruit, and place them on 
crisp lettuce leaves. Put two tablespoonfuls of olive oil into 
a bowl, stinwith a piece of ice until the oil thickens, then add 
the juice that drained from the grape fruit ; beat thoroughly, 
baste it over the salad and send it at once to the table. 

TO SERVE SHADDOCK 

Remove the thick skin and this, by the way, may be 
reserved for candying or conserving not for the sick 
separate each. carpel; pick up one carpel at a time, taking 
the ends between the forefinger and thumbs, bend it back, 
cracking the white bitter skin in the center. Peel this skin 
off, or turn the pulp out into an individual glass dish, 
sprinkle over a little finely-shaved ice, and serve at once. 

This is frequently flavored with a tablespoonful of 
sherry or Madeira. 

HUCKLEBERRIES, BLUEBERRIES, 
WHORTLEBERRIES OR BILBERRIES 

These berries, known by different names in different 
places, commonly grow wild in our woods ; in fact they are 
rarely cultivated. They contain some free acid and a little 



392 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

sugar, and on account of their seeds are moderately laxa- 
tive if eaten alone ; with other food they are frequently 
quite constipating. Huckleberry juice is used as a remedy 
for chronic diarrhoea. Being sub-acid, the large blueberries 
can be eaten by people with whom acid fruits disagree. 

TO SERVE RAW 

Select the large blueberries and put them in the 
refrigerator until moderately cold. Dish them in a small 
glass dessert dish, and if necessary dust with powdered 
sugar. Fruits of this kind are better eaten plain, without 
either sugar or cream. 

HUCKLEBERRY JUICE 

Mash the huckleberries with an ordinary potato masher, 
in a granite or earthen bowl; put the juice into a jelly bag 
and squeeze and press it. Stand aside 1 in a cold place ; use 
as directed. 

It may be served alone, or with carbonated or plain 
water. 

HUCKLEBERRY FLUMMERY 

Peel one banana, cut it into slices and press it through 
a fine sieve. Mash sufficient large huckleberries to make 
half a cupful ; add this to the banana, stir over the fire until 
they reach boiling point, add a teaspoonful of arrowroot 
moistened in cold water, and two teaspoonfuls of sugar; 
cook five minutes and strain into a small glass dish. Serve 
cold, with plain or whipped cream. 

LEMONS AND LIMES 

Lemons and limes are not true foods from an ordinary 
standpoint, but they are agreeable as flavorings, and the 
potash and other salts they contain, mingled with vegetable 
acids, makes them valuable anti-scorbutics. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 393 

Lemon juice added to plain water is excellent in 
obesity. In fevers, it cleanses the mouth and stomach, aids 
digestion and allays thirst. 

In large quantities, lemon juice hinders digestion by 
overpowering the more mild natural acid of the stomach. 
Taken in the mouth with starchy foods, it hinders the 
mouth digestion of these foods by neutralizing the alkaline 
saliva. 

A few drops of lemon juice on fish or meat aids in 
their digestion. 

Pure lemon juice is said to be excellent in cases of 
ptomaine poisoning. 

Lemon juice intensifies the flavor of many other frui'ts. 
The yellow rind contains a volatile oil ; grated, it may be 
added as flavoring to custards and other dishes. 

MANGOES 

Mangoes seldom come to the United States in good 
condition. In .countries where grafted mangoes can be 
obtained fresh and ripe they are certainly the most luscious 
of fruits. It is said by the natives of mango countries that 
if you take a piece of skin the size of an ordinary silver 
ten-cent piece and masticate it thoroughly and swallow it, 
before eating the mango, they will never produce diarrhoea. 
I think, however, that diarrhoea is caused by eating under- 
ripe or stale fruit. 

TO SERVE MANGOES 

Wash the mangoes thoroughly in cold water and put 
them on the ice. At serving time fill a little individual 
glass dish with finely-shaved ice and sink the mango down 
into the ice. 

Always serve with it a finger bowl, as it is difficult to 
eat a mango without soiling the hands. 

To eat the mango, cut off the "cheeks," to the stone; 
with your knife make a cross on the flesh of each cheek 
and bend the skin back; simply bite the flesh from the skin. 



394 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Then peel the remaining portion around the stone and suck 
the flesh from the stone. To be good they must be free 
from strings. 

To eat a mango with strings, however, work it with 
your fingers, without breaking the skin, until you feel that 
it has been reduced to a pulp; make a hole in one end and 
suck out the flesh as you would suck an orange, leaving 
all the strings inside, or eat it with a spoon. 

ORANGES 

The common sweet orange is a very useful fruit, both 
in health and sickness. It is always refreshing, and not 
liable to upset digestion. It is especially useful for chil- 
dren who have weak digestion. In fevers it allays thirst. 
Orange juice should be used daily for children who have 
rickets, between the meal hours. 

TO SERVE ORANGES IN THE HALF SHELL 

Chill the oranges. At serving time plunge them into 
boiling water; do not allow them to remain an instant. 
Wipe, cut them into halves and serve on a dainty doily. 

Induce the patient to eat oranges and grape fruit with- 
out sugar. 

TO SERVE IN GLASS DISH 

Chill the orange, plunge in boiling water according 
to preceding recipe, quickly remove the skin and all the 
white portion underneath the skin. With a sharp knife 
remove each carpel, take out the seeds, put the solid flesh 
in a pretty glass dish and serve. 

TO SERVE AN ORANGE IN THE SKIN 

Plunge a cold orange into boiling water; do not allow 
it to remain an instant. Cut the skin into eighths, begin- 
ning at the blossom end, but do not detach it from the stem 
end. Loosen the skin carefully from the flesh, take the 
orange out, and remove every particle of white pith from 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 395 

the outside. Separate the carpels without breaking the 
skin, put them together as they were originally in the 
orange, stand the orange back in the skin, tucking the end 
of each bit of skin down, forming a sort of loop. This 
will keep the orange from falling apart, and makes an ex- 
ceedingly pretty dish. Serve on a paper mat or pretty 
linen doily. 

COMPOTE OF ORANGE 

Separate the carpels of a fine seedless orange, Put 
four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of water in a sauce- 
pan, stir until it reaches boiling point, boil two minutes, 
add the juice of half an orange, pour hot over the carpels 
and stand aside to cool. 

ORANGE COCKTAIL 

Purchase a large bright yellow-skinned orange for the 
"basket." Cut through the skin into the flesh, making a 
handle from a band of skin, and a basket ; scoop out the pulp. 
Throw the basket thus made into cold water until crisp and 
bright. Cut a sweet orange into halves, scoop out the pulp, 
saving the juice and rejecting the seeds ; add to the pulp and 
juice a tablespoonful of powdered sugar and a tablespoonful 
of brandy and fill the orange basket. Serve on a mat or 
doily. 

If the basket is troublesome, cut the orange into halves, 
scoop out the flesh and use "the half shell." These baskets 
are also pretty for whipped cream and orange jelly. 

ORANGEADE 

Squeeze the juice of one orange in a tumbler, add a 
teaspoonful of powdered sugar, stir until the sugar is dis- 
solved and fill the tumbler with plain cold water. 

ORANGE SQUASH 

Put the juice of one orange in a tumbler, add a tea- 
spoonful of powdered sugar, and when the sugar is dis- 



396 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

solved fill the glass from a siphon of either plain, car- 
bonated water, seltzer or soda water. 

ENGLISH ORANGE SQUASH 

Put a rasping of the yellow rind of an orange, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and a half cupful of water in a 
saucepan to boil, boil five minutes and strain. When this 
is cold add the juice of a large orange; put it in a glass, 
add a little finely-shaved ice and fill the glass with soda 
or carbonated water. 

FROZEN ORANGE JUICE 

Squeeze the juice from one orange, sweeten it with a 
tablespoonful of powdered sugar, put it in an individual 
freezer, pack with salt and ice, and turn now and then 
until frozen like wet snow; then stir rapidly a minute and 
it is ready to serve. Serve in a small dainty punch glass 
or ice cream stem glass. For fever patients omit sugar. 

ORANGE SORBET 

Follow the preceding recipe, pack the freezer, and stir 
constantly until the mixture is frozen. Beat the white 
of one egg until stiff, add a tablespoonful of powdered 
sugar and beat again ; remove the dasher from the freezer, 
stir in the meringue, cover and let it stand thirty to forty 
minutes. 

ORANGE SPONGE 

Squeeze the juice from one orange ; it should measure 
two-thirds of a cupful. Cover a teaspoonful of granulated 
gelatin with a tablespoonful of water to soak for a half 
hour; stand over hot water until the gelatin is dissolved. 
Turn the orange juice into the bowl, add the gelatin and 
stir until the mixture is cold, but not stiff; then fold in the 
well-beaten white of one egg. Turn into an individual 
mold or pretty glass dish and put in a cold place for one 
hour or more. Sweeten if admissible. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 397 

ORANGE SOUFFLE 

Follow the preceding recipe, and when the gelatin is 
cold (not stiff) fold in six tablespoonfuls of cream, whipped 
to a stiff froth. 



The pudding put a teaspoonful of flour and a half 
teaspoonful of cornstarch in a saucepan ; measure a half 
cupful of milk, add this gradually to the flour and corn- 
starch. Bring to boiling point; it should be smooth and 
thick. Take from the fire, beat in the yolk of one egg 
and then fold in the well-beaten white. Turn into a custard 
cup, stand the cup in a shallow pan of boiling water and 
bake in a moderate oven fifteen minutes. When done turn 
it carefully into a dessert saucer, pour over the sauce and 
serve at once. 

The sauce grate sufficient yellow rind of an orange 
to make a teaspoonful, add a tablespoonful of sugar and a 
teaspoonful of cornstarch ; mix thoroughly and add hastily 
a half cupful of boiling water; stir until the mixture boils, 
boil two minutes and strain. Take from the fire and add 
two tablespoonfuls of orange juice. 

This is a nice dessert for convalescing patients, in- 
valids or children. 



ORANGE JELLY 

Cover a teaspoonful of granulated gelatin with two 
tablespoonfuls of cold water, soak a half hour, add a table- 
spoonful of powdered sugar, stand over boiling water and 
stir until the gelatin is dissolved. Add the juice of an 
orange, stir carefully, strain, turn into an individual mold 
and stand at once in the cold. 

Orange jelly may be cooled in a shallow pan, cut into 
blocks and served in an orange basket. 



398 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

ORANGE WHIP 

Cover -one teaspoonful of granulated gelatin with" two 
tablespoonfuls of cold water to soak for a half hour ; add a 
tablespoonful of powdered sugar, stir over the fire until 
the gelatin is dissolved, and add two-thirds of a cupful of 
orange juice. Stand this aside until it begins to jelly, then 
stand the dish in another of cracked ice or ice water, and 
whip with an ordinary egg beater until the whole mixture 
is as white as snow. Turn at once into an individual mold 
and stand on the ice. This is nice served with a compote 
of orange. 

ORANGE SALAD 

Peel the orange, remove the carpels very carefully 
and arrange them neatly on a heart of lettuce. Put a 
saltspoonful of salt and one of sugar, and a tablespoonful 
of oil into a bowl, put in a piece of ice and stir until the 
salt and sugar are dissolved ; remove the ice and baste the 
mixture over the orange on the lettuce leaf. Squeeze on top 
a half teaspoonful of lemon juice, and serve at once. 

ORANGE FLOAT 

Moisten two level teaspoonfuls of cornstarch with a 
half cupful of cold water, stir constantly until it reaches 
the boiling point, boil about two minutes and add a table- 
spoonful of sugar; take from the fire, add a grating from the 
yellow rind of an orange and two tablespoonfuls of orange 
juice ; and pour while hot into the well-beaten white of one 
egg. Turn this at once into a little glass stemmed dish and 
put in the refrigerator to cool. At serving time fill the dish 
with orange juice and stand it on a pretty mat on a service 
plate. 

PEACHES AND NECTARINES 

Nectarines are not easily obtainable in this country, 
so need not be considered singly; they may be used the 
same as peaches. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 399 

Peaches are wholesome, easily digested, and contain 
less sugar than other fruits ; for this reason, they are suited 
to the rheumatic, the gouty and the diabetic; in diabetes, 
however, they must not be used unless ordered by the 
physician, and then they must be fully ripe. When mellow, 
soft and ripe, freshly picked from the tree, they are con- 
sidered curative in cases of chronic diarrhoea. A little 
underripe, eaten alone, they are laxative. 

TO SERVE WHOLE, RAW 

Wash the peach and thoroughly chill it; sink it in a 
little dish of shaved ice, stem end up; if possible, garnish 
with peach leaves and serve at once. 

For serving raw always select' a fine specimen. 

TO SERVE,, SLICED 

Pare and slice the peach at the last moment; dust it 
lightly with powdered sugar, or serve it plain. Do not 
use cream or milk ; such combinations complicate digestion. 

PEACH PUREE 

Peel one large mellow peach, press it through a sieve, 
heap it in a punch or lemonade glass, make a hole in the 
center, put in a tablespoonful of sherry or brandy, dust it 
with powdered sugar and serve. 

BAKED PEACHES 

Select a very large free-stone peach, wash and wipe it ; 
stand it in a small saucer or porcelain dish, and in a hot 
oven for fifteen minutes. When done, pull the peach open 
with two forks and remove the stone; dust it with powdered 
sugar and serve. The patient must reject the skin, scoop- 
ing out the soft portion with a spoon. 

COLD PEACH SOUFFLE 

Mash one large mellow peach through a fine sieve and 
stir into it at once six tablespoonfuls of cream whipped to 



400 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

a stiff froth. I prefer this to be served without sugar. If, 
however, the patient is allowed sweet dishes, sprinkle over 
a little powdered sugar. 

ICED PEACH ON TOAST 

Bake a peach according to directions for baked peaches ; 
when the peach is done, dish it on a square of toasted 
bread, cover it with a meringue made from the white of 
one egg, dust with sugar and return to the oven a moment 
to brown. 

STEWED PEACH 

Fruit stewed without sugar will frequently agree with 
persons who cannot eat raw fruit. 

To peel the peach, plunge it into boiling water and pull 
off the skin ; put it in a saucepan, add a half cupful of water, 
cover the saucepan and cook ten minutes. Lift to the serv- 
ing dish, baste with the syrup that has formed in the bottom 
of the saucepan, and stand aside to cool. Serve plain; do 
not add sugar. 

FROZEN PEACH 

Make a puree of peach, add four tablespoonfuls of 
cream, turn into an individual freezer, pack with salt and 
ice ; turn slowly now and then until frozen. Serve in an 
individual glass stem dish or punch cup. 

PEACHES a la'IMPERATRICE 

Dish one stewed peach on four tablespoonfuls of care- 
fully-boiled rice and baste the rice with the peach syrup. 
Serve with plain cream. 

PEACH TAPIOCA 

Put a teaspoonful of granulated tapioca into four 
tablespoonfuls of water, soak for twenty minutes, and stir 
over hot water until transparent and rather thick. Pare 
a large ripe peach ; with a skewer push out the stone, keep- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 401 

ing the peach whole. Stand it in a ramekin dish, fill the 
stone space with tapioca, dust with a tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar and bake in the oven until the peach is 
tender and slightly brown. Just before you take it out, 
dust again with sugar and let it melt over the peach. Serve 
warm with cream. 

PEACH ICE CREAM 

Sweeten a half pint of good cream, turn it into an 
individual freezer and stir slowly until frozen like wet 
snow. Peel and press a very ripe peach through a sieve, 
stir it into the frozen cream, put on the cover and turn 
the crank slowly until the mixture is again frozen. 

PEACH DUMPLING 

Make the same as apricot dumpling. 

PEACH TOAST 

Peel one peach, remove the stone and crack it ; take out 
the kernel, cut it into halves, put it into a saucepan with 
a tablespoonful of sugar and a half cupful of water; boil 
two minutes, strain, and add the peach that has been 
pressed through a sieve, and a teaspoonful of almond paste 
or ground almonds. Have ready a square of nicely-toasted 
bread, heap the puree on the toast and serve. 

A nice breakfast for the chronic dyspeptic. 

PEACH PUFF 

Pare a ripe peach, press the flesh through a sieve and 
stir into it the well-beaten white of one egg; heap this into 
a ramekin dish, dust with powdered sugar and bake five 
minutes in a moderately quick oven. 

PEACH PUDDING 

One large mellow peach, peeled and pressed through 
a sieve; add to it the yolk of one egg slightly beaten, and 

26 



402 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

one tablespoonful of sugar. Dust an individual baking 
dish or casserole thickly with bread crumbs, put in the 
peach mixture and bake eight minutes in a quick oven. 
Beat the white of the egg to a stiff froth, add a tablespoon- 
ful of powdered sugar and beat until fine and dry ; heap 
this over the top of the pudding, dust it with powdered 
sugar and put back in the oven a minute to brown. Serve 
cold. 

PEACHES AND HONEY 

Put one tablespoonful of peach brandy into a glass, 
add a tablespoonful of honey, mix, and ,fill the glass with 
either plain or carbonated water. 

PEACH SYLLABUB 

Peel and mash one peach through a sieve, add a table- 
spoonful of powdered sugar, stir into it eight tablespoonfuls 
of cream whipped to a stiff froth, heap in a glass dish, and 
when very cold serve. 

PEACH BRANDY 

Mash a quart of ripe peaches, without peeling, and 
break half the stones ; put them in two half-gallon fruit 
jars, add a pint of 95% grain alcohol to each jar, and a 
pint of water; cover and stand aside over night. Strain 
off the liquor, carefully pressing the peaches, then strain 
this through two thicknesses of cheesecloth. Add a half 
pint of rock candy syrup and a tablespoonful of caramel; 
mix, bottle and cork. 

HOT PEACH TODDY 

This dish used to be ordered by physicians, more 
frequently than now, but the recipe is well worth having. 

Split a large mellow peach into halves, remove the 
stone, stand the peach, skin side down, into a baking dish, 
dust it with a tablespoonful of powdered sugar and bake 
until tender. Press it from the skin into a small pitcher; 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 403 

add a teaspoonful of powdered sugar, a grating of nutmeg, 
four tablespoonfuls of brandy or whiskey, and sufficient 
boiling water to make a pint. Stir and stand aside to 
cool. When wanted, fill a tumbler quarter full of the toddy 
and fill it with boiling water. More brandy may be added 
if desired. 

This is excellent in cases of chronic diarrhoea and dysen- 
tery. 

PEARS 

The Bartlett pear when fully ripe is soft and luscious, 
and will almost "melt in your mouth." It is more easily 
digested than raw apple ; but the average pear contains tiny 
particles of silica throughout the flesh, which are apt to 
provoke gastro-intestinal irritation in children and invalids, 
even when cooked. 

PEAR HONEY 

Pare and remove the cores from four Bartlett pears ; 
put them in water to prevent discoloration. Boil together 
a half cupful (four ounces) of sugar and the same quantity 
of water until the syrup will spin a light thread when 
dropped from a spoon. Grate the pears into the syrup, 
boil five minutes and put in tumblers or jars. 

This makes a nice sweet to serve with toast or rusks. 

STEWED PEARS 

Peel a Bartlett pear, remove the core, put it into a 
saucepan, cover with boiling water and stew gently until 
perfectly tender. Lift the pear to the serving dish, add a 
tablespoonful of sugar to the water, boil until it forms a 
thin syrup, baste it over the pear and stand aside to cool. 

BAKED PEAR 

Peel a Bartlett pear, cut it into halves and remove the 
seeds. Put the halves into a ramekin or individual casserole, 
dust lightly with powdered sugar, add two tablespoonfuls 



404 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

of water and bake in a quick oven until the pear is tender 
and slightly glazed. Serve hot or cold. 

COMPOTE OF PEAR 

Cut a piece of bread the shape of a half pear and toast 
it. At serving time butter it lightly and put on the half 
of a stewed pear, rounding side up. Grate the other half 
quickly into a half cupful of water; bring to a boil, add 
a half teaspoonful of cornstarch that has been moistened 
in a little cold water and a tablespoonful of sugar; stir 
and boil just a minute, take from the fire, add a teaspoon- 
ful of brandy or a tablespoonful of sherry, and baste it over 
the pear and the toast. It is wise to make the grated pear 
first, so the whole may be served warm, not necessarily hot. 

PINEAPPLE 

Pineapple juice contains an enzyme, bromelin, which 
aids in the digestion of the albuminoids. The raw expressed 
juice is said to be very beneficial in cases of sore throat, 
tonsilitis or diphtheria. 

PINEAPPLEADE 

Boil two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a half pint of 
water together for two minutes. Take from the fire, and 
when cool add one ripe pineapple, grated, and stand aside 
for two or three hours. Strain through two thicknesses 
of cheesecloth, wringing the pineapple fibre dry. Put it 
in a jar, and keep in a cold place. 

This may be sipped slowly ; or put four tablespoonfuls 
in a tumbler, and fill the tumbler with plain or carbonated 
water. 

Raw pineapple should not be served with starchy foods 
alone. It is truly an accompaniment to foods rich in protein. 

PINEAPPLE CIDER 

Grate one pineapple, put it into a pitcher with two 
quarts of cold water, cover the top with a piece of cheese- 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 405 

cloth and stand it aside in a rather warm place for two 
or three days ; stir it down during the last day. Strain 
through two thicknesses of cheesecloth, bottle, cork, and 
wire down the corks; put the bottles on their sides in the 
refrigerator for twenty-four hours, and it is ready for use. 



PINEAPPLE SHRUB 

Grate one large ripe pineapple, put it into an ordinary 
two-quart fruit jar, add one cupful of sugar, and fill the jar 
with cold water; shake and stir thoroughly until the sugar 
is dissolved. Put the top on the jar loosely and stand it 
in a warm place (about 80 Fahr.) for three days until the 
shrub begins to ferment. As soon as fermentation is quite 
pronounced, stand it in the ice and it is ready for use. 

This may be served, a teaspoonful or a tablespoonful at 
a time, to persons who have sore throat, or to tuberculosis 
patients, or may be given in a tumbler with cr-acked ice and 
carbonated water; or, if admissible, two tablespoonfuls may 
be mixed with two tablespoonfuls of rum in a tumbler, 
and the tumbler filled with carbonated water. 



GRATED PINEAPPLE 

This is used frequently in cases of tonsilitis and sore 
throat ; it is also good for children with whooping cough. 

Pare the pineapple, remove the eyes, grate quickly, 
saving all the juice, strain and stand it aside or put it in a 
glass jar on the ice, to use as wanted, a teaspoonful at a 
time. It is much better if used without sugar. 



PLUMS 

Plums are rarely used as diet for the sick ; unless very 
ripe, they are apt to cause diarrhoea and intestinal colic. 
Green gages and large blue plums are more digestible than 
the smaller varieties. 



406 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

TO SERVE RAW 

Select perfectly ripe large green o'r yellow gages, put 
them in a sieve, plunge them into boiling water, then 
into cold water. Peel carefully, arrange them in a pretty 
dish of cracked ice, and they are ready to serve. 



PLUM JUICE 

Cut a pint of blue plums into halves and remove the 
stones; put them into a kettle with a half cupful of water, 
cover and stew for ten minutes; mash and press them 
through a sieve; put this aside in a cold place. When 
wanted for use, add a pint of cold water, stir thoroughly 
and strain through two thicknesses of cheesecloth. 

This may be kept in a jar in the refrigerator and used 
the same as grape or currant juice. 



PRUNES 

A small blue plum, long and narrow, known as the 
prune plum, is dried and sold in almost every market of 
the world. We have many varieties of prunes, some excel- 
lent, some good, and many inferior. The California large 
dried prune is, as a rule, very good. Dehydrated prunes 
retain their flavor to a marked degree, and are decidedly 
better than prunes dried by the ordinary methods ; in fact, 
dehydrated fruits, as a rule, retain all the flavor of the 
fresh fruits. 

Prunes contain a large percentage of sugar, and when 
eaten alone are easy of digestion and laxative. They should 
be soaked over night, and should not be cooked with sugar. 

A word of caution Do not eat stewed prunes for 
breakfast, and at the same meal drink coffee. I do not 
know of anything that will more quickly provoke indiges- 
tion and sour stomach. Cereals and prunes make a good 
combination, but do not wash them down with coffee. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 407 

STEWED PRUNES 

Wash a pound of prunes through several cold waters ; 
cover them with a half pint of cold water and soak over 
night. Next morning bring them to boiling point, lift the 
prunes with a skimmer, add a bay leaf to the juice and 
boil it down one half; pour it over the prunes, and stand 
aside to cool. 

PUFFED PRUNES 

Wash the prunes through several cold waters, cover 
them with cold water and let them stand over night ; next 
morning drain, and they are ready to use. These are better 
for constipation than stewed prunes. 

PRUNES AND RICE 

Serve six puffed prunes on the top of hot boiled rice. 
Use cream if admissible. 

PRUNE PULP 

Press puffed prunes through a sieve sufficiently fine 
to reject all the skin ; serve this pulp in a glass saucer with 
a little thick cream. 

PRUNE SOUFFLE 

Press six puffed prunes through a sieve, fold into them 
the well-beaten white of an egg; put this into an individual 
baking dish or a custard cup, dust thickly with powdered 
sugar, bake in a quick oven five minutes, and serve at once. 

BAKED PRUNES 

Wash the prunes through several cold waters. To 
each pound allow one pint of fresh cold water. Put them 
in a casserole mold, pour over the water, cover and let 
them stand all night. Next morning put them in a slow 
oven and bake for at least one hour. 



408 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR T&E SICK 

PRUNE JELLY 

Press six stewed prunes through a fine sieve. Cover 
one teaspoonful of gelatin with two tablespoonfuls of cold 
water to soak for a half hour, then add two tablespoonfuls 
of hot water, stir until the gelatin is dissolved, add the 
prunes, stir until well mixed, turn into a small fancy mold 
and stand away to harden. Serve with plain cream. 

PRUNE CREAM 

Skin and stone four stewed prunes, press the flesh 
through a fine sieve, fold in six tablespoonfuls of whipped 
cream, heap it in a small glass stem dish, make a tiny hole 
in the center and put in one tablespoonful of orange juice; 
serve at once. 

QUEEN PRUNES 

Press six stewed prunes through a sieve ; heap the pulp 
into an individual glass dish, cover it thickly with toasted 
bread crumbs, garnish the dish with whipped cream, and use- 
it at once. This is better cold than hot. 

PRUNELLES 

Prunelles are the light Italian plum sold in our markets 
in great dried masses like dates. While they are exceed- 
ingly palatable and may be eaten by the well, they are not 
used as diet for the sick. 

QUINCES 

On account of the short summers in the United States, 
the quince never ripens sufficiently to be eaten raw. Even 
when thoroughly cooked we rarely eat it alone; and I find 
no place for them in diet for the sick, except as a flavoring 
to apples, or in jelly. 

Quince and guava jellies are the most wholesome of 
the sweet jellies; in fact they contain only a trace of free 
acids, and can be taken by persons who have to reject all 
acid fruits. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 409 

QUINCE JELLY 

Wash the quinces and wipe them, cut them into halves 
and remove every particle of the seed core and seeds ; slice 
the quinces without paring, put them into a porcelain-lined 
or granite kettle, add, to each two pounds, one quart of 
water. Cover the saucepan, bring to boiling point, stew 
twenty minutes, or until the quinces are tender, and drain 
over night. Next morning measure the juice, and to each 
pint allow three quarters of a pound of sugar. Put the 
juice in a preserving kettle, bring it to a boil, skim, boil 
rapidly five minutes, add the sugar, stir until the sugar is 
dissolved and begin to try. As soon as it drops, jelly like, 
from a spoon, turn it into the jelly glasses. 

RHUBARB 

Rhubarb is really not a fruit, but as it is used in 
the place of fruit, it is considered under this heading. 
When thoroughly cooked, it acts as a laxative, but on 
account of the oxalic acid it contains, I find no use for it 
in diet for the sick in fact I find very little use for it in 
diet for the well. Mixed with dried soaked figs in equal 
quantities, it makes a good marmalade. 



It is said that the strawberry took its name from the 
old-fashioned way of cultivating and growing it. When 
the plants were of a fairly good size, the entire ground 
was covered with straw to protect the berry from sand 
and dirt so they were "straw berries." 

The popularity of the strawberry is based largely on 
its odor and flavor. It is wholesome when taken in mod- 
eration, and is always better when served plain, without 
cream. Strawberries and strawberry juice are considered 
valuable in diet for the gouty on account of the salts they 
contain (potash, soda and lime). They are cooling and 
laxative. Some people seem to have an idiosyncrasy for 



410 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

strawberries; even a half dozen will produce a rash that 
is exceedingly unpleasant. 

The French, who always study to heighten the flavor 
of food, claim that a few drops of orange or lemon juice 
intensifies the flavor of strawbrries. Of this we are certain : 
strawberries served in orange juice are much more whole- 
some than strawberries served with cream. 

TO SERVE 

For the sick select large ripe sweet berries free from 
sand. Arrange them on a pretty dish, around a little 
mount of powdered ice. To eat, lift them by the stems, 
dip them in the sugar and bite off the berry. 

TO SERVE IN ORANGE JUICE 

Stem a half doeen large strawberries, with a silver 
knife cut them into halves, put them into a glass punch 
cup, strain over the juice of one orange, stand the cup on 
a pretty doily, on a service plate. These should be mod- 
erately chilled. 

FRESH STRAWBERRY JUICE 

Put the strawberries into a flat kettle, mash them with 
an ordinary wooden pestle, turn the mashed berries into 
two thicknesses of cheesecloth and wring them until the 
pulp is dry. Put it at once into clean glass jars and keep 
in a cold place. 

Fruit juices for the sick should be served without sugar. 
Put four tablespoonfuls in a tumbler, and fill the tumbler 
with plain or effervescing water. Induce the patient to take 
this slowly, and hold it in the mouth a moment before 
swallowing. To preserve strawberry juice follow the rule 
for grape juice.

NUTS 

The fruits of trees, enclosed in hard woody coverings 
instead of soft skins, are) called nuts. In some, the fruit is 
drupaceous, as the almond, for instance we eat the "stone 
kernel" and reject the pulpy covering. This is true also 
of the nutmeg; although in countries where nutmegs are 
plentiful, the flesh, which closely resembles the peach, is 
used for jellies and jams. Nutmeg jelly is tart and tasty, 
and makes a nice 1 accompaniment to game. 

Nuts are divided into two classes, nitrogenous and 
carbonaceous. The nitrogenous are those containing a large 
amount of tissue-building foods, as peanuts, pecans, Eng- 
lish walnuts, hazel, filbert or cobnuts, pinons, and hickory 
nuts in general. Almonds and pistachio nuts are used 
largely as flavoring. The chestnut and the chinquapin are 
the only two starchy nuts in common use. The black wal- 
nut, white walnut or butternut, Brazilian nuts, souari and 
cocoanuts are oleaginous, containing considerable heat and 
energy food. The cashew nut (Anacardmm occidentale) , 
a common nut in Central and South America, has not until 
recently been introduced in the United States ; its chemical 
composition is not known, but the fruit itself is interest- 
ing. The tree is short and shrub-like. The fruit is the 
shape of an ordinary bell pepper, sometimes scarlet, some- 
times yellow, and both colors are found on the same tree. 
The fruit is known to the natives as "cashew apple" and 
is edible. The nut is inclosed in a leathery covering and 
springs from the blossom end of the fruit. The pulp 
around the nut contains a very caustic, acrid oily substance 
which is poisonous and can only be eliminated by heat ; 
for this reason cashew nuts are always sold, in the markets, 
roasted. 

Peanuts truly belong to the leguminous seeds, but in 
our market are classed with nuts. 

Pine or pinon nuts come from the small pinons of the 
West; they are cheap, easily digested and nutritious. 



412 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

In many parts of the United States the common acorn 
is extensively used in making bread, which is, by the way, 
when properly made, palatable and nutritious. 

ALMONDS 

The almond is the seed of a tropical evergreen (Prunus 
Amygdalus, Baill.) The high price demanded for almonds 
places them, from a food standpoint, among the luxuries, 
appetizers and flavorings. They have, however, a decided 
medicinal value. Some physicians recommend an emulsion 
of almonds where fatty food is called! for and olive oil is 
not well borne. Almond milk is very beneficial in cases 
of stomach trouble. Six almonds, blanched and eaten raw, 
will frequently relieve an acute attack of indigestion, pro- 
vided they are thoroughly masticated. 

In the United States we have fixed 'in our minds some- 
where that almonds are digesters, so we serve them, salted 
and roasted, at the end of the meal. The enzymes are killed 
by the roasting, and the almonds become a burden rather 
than an aid to digestion. Serve them raw. 

BITTER ALMONDS 

Bitter almonds taste like the kernel of a peach ; they 
are only used for flavoring, and then in small quantities. 

ALMOND WAFERS 

Mix one cupful of almond paste with one and a half 
cupfuls of warm water, and stir in sufficient bran to make 
a hard dough ; this will take nearly one quart. Roll it to 
a very thin sheet, cut it into wafers four inches long and 
two inches wide, and bake in a moderate oven to a golden 
brown. The bran must be clean bran, free from flour. 

TO BLANCH ALMONDS 

Cover the almonds with boiling water; let them stand 
five minutes, drain, put them on a coarse towel and rub 
off the skins. Stand these in a cool oven, where they will 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 413 

dry, without browning; if they are the slightest browned, 
the digestive qualities are killed. 

SALTED ALMONDS 

Shell and blanch the almonds. Put them in a pan, dust 
lightly with salt, and stand them at the oven door until 
they are thoroughly dried, not cooked or baked. 

To be of service as digesters they must not be baked, 
fried or browned. 

ALMOND BUTTER 

Grind blanched almonds through the finest "plate" of 
a meat grinder or in a nut machine, and pack the "butter" 
in tumblers. Keep in a cold place. 

ALMOND CAKE 

Blanch a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds, put them 
through the meat grinder twice, then add one ounce of 
butter, mix thoroughly, add a saltspoonful of salt and stir 
in the yolks of two eggs. When this is thoroughly mixed, 
fold in the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in lightly 
greased gem pans, about two tablespoonfuls in each pan. 

To take the place of bread for the diabetic patient. 

ALMOND BISCUITS 

Blanch and grind two ounces of shelled almonds; 
pound them in a mortar if possible. Drop in the whites of 
two eggs, one at a time, beating all the while. When well 
mixed and smooth, drop by spoonfuls on oiled paper and 
bake twenty minutes in a very moderate oven. 

ALMOND PUDDING 

Blanch and grind two ounces of almonds ; add to them 
two eggs, well beaten, and a teaspoonful of butter; mix 
well, add four tablespoonfuls of milk and bake in a moderate 
oven, in an individual mold, fifteen minutes. Serve warm. 



414 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

ALMOND MILK 

Blanch and grind two ounces of almonds; put this 
"butter" into a pitcher and add gradually, stirring all the 
while, a half pint of cold water; stir continually for five 
minutes, strain through two thicknesses of cheesecloth 
and stand aside until palatably cold. 

Where almond milk is to be used two or three times 
a day, it is wise to make the desired quantity in the morn- 
ing, and keep it on the ice in a covered vessel. Four ounces 
is a feeding. 

ALMONDS AND MILK 

Follow the preceding recipe, and substitute milk for 
water. After straining add ten grains of salt to each 
individual quantity. 

ALMOND CROQUETTES 

Wash and boil four tablespoonfuls of rice. When 
done, drain, throw it into cold water to soak for ten minutes, 
and drain again. Pound this in a mortar or press it through 
a sieve. Add twelve almonds that have been blanched and 
ground, and a saltspoonful of salt. Mix well, form into 
tiny cylinders, put them on a piece of oiled paper in the 
bottom of a baking pan, and bake in a quick oven ten or 
fifteen minutes, until a golden brown. Serve with egg, 
tomato or cream sauce. 

BEECH NUTS (Fagus ferruginea, Aiton) 

These tiny, three-sided nuts are sweet and tender, but 
take no part whatever in diet for the sick. Beech nut oil 
is used in many places instead of olive oil ; it is sweet and 
bland. 

CHESTNUTS 

The chestnut is the seed of a large tree belonging to 
the oak family and to the division Costanca. Chestnuts 
form an exceedingly good starchy diet where potatoes and 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 415 

other starchy foods are not obtainable. Chestnut flour, a 
common article of commerce in almost all countries, makes 
good thickening for soups and gruels. 

BOILED CHESTNUTS 

Shell the chestnuts, remove the brown skin under- 
neath, throw them in a kettle of boiling salted water and 
boil rapidly for twenty minutes, until perfectly tender, but 
not water-soaked. Drain, turn into a heated dish and serve 
in the place of potatoes or rice. 

If admissible, they may be served with butter or cream 
sauce. 

CHESTNUTS a la POULETTE 

This is an exceedingly nice dish in cases of rheumatism 
or gout, where a little easily-digested starchy food is 
admissible. 

Boil the chestnuts as directed in preceding recipe, 
using stock instead of water. When the chestnuts are done 
drain and cover them with sauce a la Poulette. ' 

CHESTNUTS WITH WHIPPED CREAM 

Boil the chestnuts according to the directions in first 
recipe. When done press them through a colander or an 
ordinary vegetable press ; heap them in a serving dish, 
dust them with powdered sugar and garnish with whipped 
cream, or they may be served with plain cream. 

An exceedingly nice dish in cases of anaemia, where 
easily digested fat forming foods are required. 

COCOANUT (Cocos nucifera) 

Cocoanut is the fruit of a large palm growing in Central 
and South America. The soft pulp of a fresh cocoanut is 
excellent in cases of chronic constipation, but in the cen- 
tral and northern parts of the United States it is impos- 
sible to obtain fresh cocoanuts. The flesh of dried cocoa- 
nuts is most indigestible, but when made into cocoanut 



416 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

milk or cream is a valuable fatty food. It is easily digested 
and palatable. 

COCOANUT MILK 

Grate a good-sized cocoanut, add a pint of boiling 
water, stir until it is thoroughly washed and water-soaked. 
Put it in a cheesecloth bag or towel and wring the fibre 
dry. Stand the milk thus obtained in a cold place ; throw 
the fibre away. 

The milk thus obtained may be used for sauces. The 
"cream" makes a nice salad dressing, or pudding sauce. 

COCOANUT CREAM 

Stand cocoanut "milk" aside in a cold place for four 
hours, then skim off the "cream" and use it in the place of 
ordinary cream or oil. 

COCOANUT CUSTARD 

Skim the cream from the surface of the cocoanut milk. 
Put a half cupful of the "milk" in a double boiler. Beat the 
yolk of one egg with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, add the 
hot cocoanut milk, stir in the double boiler over the fire 
until it thickens like soft custard ; take it from the fire and 
pour it slowly into the well-beaten white of the egg. Turn 
this at once into a pretty glass dessert cup and stand aside 
to cool. 

COCOANUT AND TOMATO 

Peel a solid tomato and cut it in slices one inch thick; 
put the two center slices on a serving dish, dust them 
lightly with salt and pour over two tablespoonfuls of cocoa- 
nut cream and serve. 

This is one of the most wholesome ways of serving 
tomatoes. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 417 

AMBROSIA 

Remove the pulp from one orange or half a grape fruit ; 
arrange the flesh neatly on a glass individual dessert plate, 
pour over cocoanut cream and serve. 

Without sugar, this can be taken by a diabetic pa- 
tient ; it is exceedingly good for the rheumatic and gouty, 
and gives variety to long-continued diet for an invalid. 

PEANUTS (Arachis hypogaea, Linn.) 

In some parts of the United States these are also called 
ground nuts, but must not be confounded with the true 
ground nut (Apois tuberosa). The peanut is truly a legu- 
minous plant which ripens its seeds below the surface of 
the soil. 

COMPOSITION OF SHELLED PEANUTS (Church) 

Water 7.5 

Albuminoids, etc 24.5 

Starch, etc 1 1.7 

Oil 50.0 

Cellulose 4.5 

Mineral matter 1.8 

Peanuts, unroasted, ground and made into meal, make 
good thickenings for soup and sauces, or may be used in 
half quantity in breakfast muffins and in peanut bread. 
Roasted peanuts are used for peanut butter, peanut wafers, 
or like the unroasted ones, may be added to sauces and 
soups. They are an exceedingly concentrated food, and 
must not be eaten in large quantities. 

PEANUT WAFERS 

Mix a half cupful of peanut meal with a half cupful of 
peanut butter and one cupful of sugar. Dissolve a half 
teaspoonful of soda in a half cupful of warm water, add 
this to the nut mixture, and work in nearly a quart of 
Graham flour; the dough must be quite hard. Knead until 

27 



418 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

the dough is smooth ; roll it out in a thin sheet, cut it into 
squares of two inches and bake in a slow oven until a 
golden brown. 

A good bread for persons troubled with constipation. 

PEANUT BUTTER 

i 

Shell roasted peanuts, put them in a towel and rub them, 
and then blow away the skins. Dust them with salt, put 
them through the meat grinder with the finest plate, or use 
a regular nut grinder. Pack at once into glass tumblers, cover 
with paraffin and stand away, to use as needed. This may be 
used plain, or diluted with water. 

A meat substitute. 



PEANUT SOUP 

Put a quarter of a tumbler of peanut butter into a 
double boiler, with a half pint of water, a saltspoonful of 
salt, a slice of onion, a bit of chopped celery, or a half 
saltspoonful of celery seed. When scalding hot, add a level 
teaspoonful of cornstarch moistened in a little water, stir 
for five minutes and serve. If too thick add a little hot 
water. 

PINONS OR PINE NUTS 

These nuts are sold in some markets under the name 
of pignolias, a corruption of the Italian name. They consist 
of the seeds of several varieties of pines. Those most 
commonly sold in the United States come from the scrubby 
pinon trees (Pinus edulis) of the far West; the larger ones 
from the hard cones of the South European pines. They are 
usually sold shelled. As they are threshed on the floor of 
barns, or in blankets, they are usually dirty, and require 
washing and drying before they are fit for use. They are 
cheap, nutritious and palatable, the most valuable of all the 
common nuts for everyday cookery. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 419 

PINON BUTTER 

They may be made into butter the same as peanut but- 
ter. For the sake of variety, they may be mixed with 
ground meat for Hamburg steaks or beef roll, or a few may 
be sprinkled over a lettuce salad. They make good stuffing 
for tomatoes and cucumbers. 

PINE NUT MILK 

Pine nuts contain less nitrogen and more fatty matter 
than almonds. They are less dense than most nuts, which 
makes them a valuable diet for the sick. Put a quarter of 
a pound of pine nuts through a meat grinder, add one quart 
of cold water or milk, stir constantly with an egg-beater for 
five or ten minutes, and strain through two thicknesses of 
cheesecloth. Keep covered in a cold place. 

PISTACHIO NUT (Pistacia vera) 

This nut contains a considerable amount of chlorophyll, 
the green coloring matter of plants, and is used only as 
flavoring. Now and then, however, a few salted in the 
shell are appetizing and aid in the digestion of other foods. 



This nut, the fruit of the genus Coryocar, a tree belong- 
ing to the Camellia or tea family, grows in the central part 
of South America, where they are universally called butter 
nuts, on account of their excessive fatty matter. It con- 
tains less cellulose than any other nut. In cases of perni- 
cious anaemia or tuberculosis, or any other disease where 
the object is to- increase the weight of the patient, they are 
most valuable, because they are palatable and easy of diges- 
tion. 

They may be ground and made into butter, and served 
on bread ; or they may be eaten, one or two at a time, thor- 
oughly masticated. Chopped fine, on a lettuce leaf, with 
a little French dressing, they are most appetizing. 



420 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

MIXED NUT MILK 

Make according to the preceding recipe, using a mix- 
ture of pine nuts, almonds and pecans. 

NUT ' CHEESE 

This is made by grinding a pound of mixed nuts, a 
half pound of pecans, a quarter of a pound of pine nuts, 
a quarter of a pound of almonds. Add just enough water 
to bind the whole together, pack the mixture into baking 
powder cans or tumblers and keep in a cold place. 

Thin slices of nut cheese between slices of whole wheat 
bread make a good school sandwich for children. Followed 
by a glass of Vichy or plain seltzer, make a good luncheon 
for rheumatic or gouty patients. 

NUT AND FRUIT CRACKERS 

Rub a half cupful of almond butter into one quart 
of whole wheat flour; mix, and add sufficient water to 
moisten; the dough must be very hard. Knead it for five 
minutes, pound with a potato masher for five minutes, 
and roll it into a very thin sheet. Sprinkle half of the 
sheet with either chopped dates, ground soaked figs or 
chopped raisins; fold over the other half, and with a rolling 
pin roll the two carefully together. With a sharp knife 
cut it into crackers two inches wide and three inches long, 
and bake in a moderate oven until brown and crisp, about 
twenty minutes. 

Peanut or pine nut butter may be substituted for 
almond butter, and Graham flour may be substituted for 
whole wheat flour. 

Eaten slowly at bedtime followed by a glass of water, 
they will frequently correct constipation. 

NUT SOUFFLE 

Soak one pint of soft bread crumbs in one pint of 
cocoanut milk or water for fifteen minutes. Stir over the 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 421 

fire until perfectly smooth ; take from the fire, add a half 
pint of chopped pine or pecan nuts, the yolks of four eggs, 
a level teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper, and fold in 
carefully the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Turn this into 
a baking dish and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. 

This dish takes the place of both bread and meat, and 
may be given to children as the noonday meal. It is good 
in cases of rheumatism and gout. 

This quantity is sufficient for four persons ; for a single 
portion divide all the ingredients by four. 

WATER CHESTNUTS 

These are really not nuts, but are classed with the 
nuts for the sake of convenience. They are the crisp vege- 
table ingredient in nearly all the rich stews made by the 
Chinese and Japanese cooks. In chemical composition 
they resemble closely the stachys and Jerusalem artichoke. 
Boiled in plain water.o.r in chicken stock, served with cre'am 
sauce, without thickening, they give variety to the long 
continued diet of the diabetic and the obese. 

MOCK CANDY 

Besides being a good candy for children, this mixture 
makes a nice filling for school sandwiches. 

Put through a meat grinder a half pound of soaked 
figs, a half pound of seeded raisins, a half pound of stoned 
dates, a half pound of pine nuts, a half pound of pecan 
meats, a quarter of a pound of blanched almonds and a 
quarter of a pound of Brazilian or black walnuts. The 
better way to mix them is to put a few at a time into the 
meat chopper, and by the time the last are ground they are 
well mixed. With your hand work the mixture until it is 
a little soft, pack it into baking powder boxes or jelly tum- 
blers, and stand it in a cold place to keep. 

If this is to be made at once into caramels, roll it out 
in a sheet a half inch thick ; cut it into caramels, wrap each 
in waxed paper and put them in a tin box for keeping. 



422 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 



Chopped almonds, pecan meats and pine nuts may be 
sprinkled over lettuce or Romaine, covered with French 
dressing and used as dinner salad where meat is not allow- 
able. 

Pine nuts may be used as filling for birds or chickens. 

Peanuts may be added to cream vegetable soups. 
Where starch is not allowable, use pine nuts, almonds, Bra- 
zilian nuts and black walnuts for nut soups. 

Where feeding without meat must be continuous, a 
creative mind can invent many recipes in which nuts may 
be used to advantage. 

Sprinkled over boiled spinach or kale, or over a dish 
of stewed cabbage, they give a pleasant flavor, and add the 
necessary protein. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 423 

GELATIN JELLIES 

GELATIN 

Gelatin is a nitrogenous food, but the nitrogen it con- 
tains is not available for tissue building. The ordinary 
commercial gelatin does, however, when made into jelly, 
give a good vehicle for the conveyance of other foods. 
Connective tissue of beef, veal, mutton and chicken will, 
by continued cooking in water, yield gelatin. For the sick, 
buy plain, unflavored gelatin. 

Isinglass, fish gelatin, is obtained from the swimming 
bladders of sturgeons ; and by many dietitians it is preferred 
to ordinary gelatin. 

I doubt very much whether the ordinary calves' foot 
jelly made at home, is better than a quick jelly made' from 
the commercial gelatin. The flavoring is different, and this 
may have something to do with the patient's liking for it. 

Gelatin is insoluble in cold water, but it is wise to mix 
even granulated gelatin with cold water before pouring over 
the boiling water. Where gelatin is boiled, a larger 
quantity of gelatin or a less quantity of water must be 
used. After rapid boiling gelatin does not readily solidify. 

Vegetable gelatin, clarified sea weeds, is quite 
nutritious. 

Gelatin water has been found very useful in cases of 
hemorrhage during typhoid fever. 

Meat jellies made by condensing beef, veal or chicken 
stock are not more nutritious than gelatins made from 
commercial gelatin. But they are more stimulating and have 
a pleasant flavor, and for this reason are more agreeable to 
the invalid. 

LEMON JELLY 

Cover one teaspoonful of granulated gelatin with four 
tablespoonfuls of water, soak a half hour, then add a half 
cupful of boiling water, four tablespoonfuls of lemon juice 
and three tablespoonfuls of sugar ; strain through two thick- 
nesses of cheesecloth and turn either into a pretty small 



424 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

stem glass dish or in an individual mold. At serving time 
plunge the mold quickly into hot water, loosen the jelly 
around the top and turn it out on a pretty china serving dish. 

LEMON JELLY FOR DIABETICS AND OBESE 

Cover one package of gelatin with one cupful of cold 
water to soak for a half hour; then add a pint and a half 
of boiling water, stir until the gelatin is dissolved, add one 
gill (a half cupful) of lemon juice, a level teaspoonful of 
beef extract and a level teaspoonful of celery salt ; stir, 
strain, add two drops of Tabasco and put it in a mold to 
harden. 

Served with cold meat, or chopped fine on lettuce 
leaves with a little French dressing. 

ORANGE JELLY 

Cover one teaspoonful of gelatin with four table- 
spoonfuls of cold water to soak for a half hour; add a half 
cupful of boiling water, a half cupful of orange juice and 
six tablespoonfuls of sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, 
strain and put into two molds or glasses to harden. 

This is very pretty if colored slightly brown with 
caramel. 

Serve turned from the mold, or cut it into blocks and 
serve in an orange basket. 

WINE JELLY 

While there is little or no nourishment in any of the 
gelatin jellies, they make exceedingly good vehicles for the 
conveyance of stimulants when stimulants are ordered. 

Cover a half package of gelatin with a cupful of 
cold water, let it soak for a half hour, then add a half cup- 
ful of sugar and a cupful of boiling water; stir over the fire 
until the gelatin is thoroughly dissolved. Strain, add one 
gill (a half cupful) of wine, turn at once into small stem 
glasses, sufficient in each glass for one feeding. This 
should make four glasses. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 425 

Brandy or rum may be substituted for sherry, or 
brandy and sherry may be mixed. 

WHITE WINE JELLY 

Put a half package of granulated gelatin, covered with 
a pint of cold water, to soak a half hour; add four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, stir the mixture over the fire until the 
gelatin is dissolved; add a half pint of white wine and 
a grating of the yellow rind of a lemon ; stir and turn at once 
into glasses. This should make three glasses. 

QUICK BEEF JELLY 

Put two teaspoonfuls of granulated gelatin in four 
tablespoonfuls of cold water and soak for a half hour. 
While this is soaking dissolve a teaspoonful of Liebig's 
beef extract in a cupful of boiling water, add a whole 
clove, a bay leaf and a half teaspoonful of celery salt; stir 
until the gelatin is dissolved. Let this stand until nearly 
cold, and add the white of one egg beaten with a table- 
spoonful of cold water. Put the mixture over the fire, bring 
to a boil, boil rapidly two minutes and strain through two 
thicknesses of cheesecloth. If well made this will be as 
clear as wine. Turn it at once into a small pan or dish, 
and stand it aside to harden. 

Use as a garnish for cold meat dishes, or it may be 
given in the place of beef tea where cold substitutes are 
ordered. 

This can be made in a very few minutes, and quickly 
chilled on the ice. 

CALVES' FOOT JELLY 

4 calves' feet 2 inches of stick cinnamon 

6 quarts of cold water I pound of white sugar 

Juice of four lemons Juice of two oranges 

Whites and shells of two eggs 

Clean the feet, wash and scrub them well in cold water. 
Put them in a soup kettle with cold water, and simmer 



Mb MRS. RORERS DIET FOR THE SICK 

slowly for eight hours. It should be reduced to two quarts. 
When done, strain the liquid into an earthen bowl, and 
stand it away until next day. In the morning, remove all 
the fat from the surface, and the sediment from the bottom 
of the jelly. Put it in a kettle, and stand it over the fire; 
and the cinnamon, sugar, lemon and orange juice, the 
whites of the eggs slightly beaten, and the shells crushed. 
Mix all the ingredients well tpgether, and boil it hard, 
without stirring, twenty minutes. Throw in a gill of cold 
water, let it come again to a boil ; then stand it on the side 
of the range, and keep it closely covered for a half hour. 
Dip a flannel jelly bag into boiling water, and hang it 
where a bowl can be placed underneath. Now pour the 
jelly into the bag carefully, and let it drip slowly. On no 
account must you squeeze or touch the bag, as this clouds 
the jelly at once. Turn it into molds and stand in a cold 
place. 

If you use wine, a half pint of sherry may be added 
before putting it into the molds. 

CHICKEN JELLY 

For this purchase a fowl ; the white meat may be used 
as food for the family. Take all the dark meat and the 
rough pieces. Crack the bones with a cleaver, put them 
in a saucepan with one quart of cold water, bring to a 
boil and skim. Simmer gently for at least three hours, then 
add a half teaspoonful of celery salt, a bay leaf, one clove 
and a thin slice of onion if admissible ; simmer thirty min- 
utes longer and strain. Stand this aside until perfectly 
cold, then remove every particle of the fat. Turn the jelly 
into a saucepan, add the juice of half a lemon and the 
white of one egg beaten with a tablespoonful of water; 
mix all together and boil rapidly five minutes; strain 
through two thicknesses of cheesecloth and stand aside to 
harden. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 427 

Use cold in the place of chicken broth, or to mask or 
garnish cold chicken dishes, or serve on lettuce leaves, with 

French dressing. 

i 

CRANBERRY GELATIN 

Wash a half pint of fresh cranberries in cold water, 
put them in a saucepan with a pint of cold water, bring to 
a boil, boil five minutes and press through a colander; add 
a cupful of sugar. Cover a tablespoonful of vegetable 
gelatin with two tablespoonfuls of cold water, let it soak 
ten minutes. Boil the cranberries, gelatin and sugar to- 
gether for five minutes, strain through cheesecloth and turn 
into a mold to harden. 

IRISH MOSS JELLY 

Press into an ordinary measuring cup sufficient Irish 
moss to make a half cupful, soak, and wash it through 
several cold waters; make sure it is free from sand and 
grit. Put one quart of milk into a double boiler, add the 
moss, bring to boiling point, cover and cook a half hour. 
Strain, add a half cupful of sugar, take from the fire, cool 
and flavor with sherry, brandy, a grating of nutmeg, or if 
admissible, a little vanilla; turn at once into molds and 
stand aside to harden. This will make five molds. 

For an individual recipe, take but two sprigs of moss 
and cook in a half pint of milk. 

IRISH MOSS JELLY No. 2 

Wash two full sprays of Irish moss through several 
cold waters ; soak an hour in fresh water, then lift the moss, 
throw it into a half pint of boiling water, cover and simmer 
until the moss is dissolved ; add four lumps of loaf sugar 
and a tabelspoonful of lemon juice, strain and turn into 
glasses or molds. 

This is especially nice in cases of tuberculosis, tonsilitis, 
quinsy and whooping cough. 



MRS. RORER S DIET FOR THE SICK 

ISINGLASS JELLY 

Put a half ounce of the best isinglass, a quarter of an 
ounce of pure powdered gum Arabic, a half ounce of rock 
candy, a quarter of a nutmeg, grated, and a pint of port 
wine into a quart fruit jar, cover, shake and stand aside 
over night. Next morning stand the jar into a kettle of 
cold water, bring the water to boiling point and simmer 
until the gum is dissolved ; stir, strain and stand aside to 
cool. 

Give a teaspoonful at a time, in cases of exhaustion. I 
have also found it useful in cases of tuberculosis. 

QUICK GRAPE JELLY 

Put two teaspoonfuls of prepared vegetable gelatin into 
a half pint of grape juice, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
stir over the fire until the gelatin is dissolved, and turn at 
once into small molds or small stem glass dishes. 

ORANGE AND WINE JELLY 

A level teaspoonful of granulated gelatin soaked in 
two tablespoonfuls of cold water; add two tablespoonfuls 
of orange juice, one tablespoonful of port wine and a table- 
spoonful of sugar ; stir over hot water until the gelatin is 
dissolved, fill at once into a small glass and stand it away 
to harden. 

If admissible, this may be served with whipped cream, 
or with a soft custard made from a half cupful of milk 
and one egg. 

COFFEE JELLY 

One teaspoonful of granulated gelatin, one tablespoon- 
ful of cold water; let this soak five minutes, add four table- 
spoonfuls of strong black coffee, two teaspoonfuls of sugar 
and two tablespoonfuls of cream ; mix thoroughly and turn 
into a small glass or mold and stand away to harden. 

Serve plain, or with cream. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 429 

This may be used as a dessert forMiabetics by omitting 
the sugar. 

CREAM JELLY FOR DIABETICS 

One teaspoonful of granulated gelatin soaked in a 
tablespoonful of cold water; add a half cupful of thick 
cream and a dash of salt ; stir over the fire until the gelatin 
is dissolved and turn at once into molds. 

Served plain or with cream or with a little black coffee. 

PLAIN JELLY WITH FRUIT 

Fill a tiny mold with either white grapes that have 
been peeled and seeded, or a few white currants stripped 
from the stem, or red currants, or raspberries, or skinned 
and stoned cherries. Make plain lemon or wine jelly, and 
pour it over the fruit in the mold; stand away to harden. 
This is pretty and palatable. 

PORT WINE JELLY 

P'ut half an ounce of isinglass into a saucepan, add a half 
cupful of cold water, soak thirty minutes, then stand over 
hot water and stir until the isinglass is dissolved ; add two 
tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar, take from the fire and 
add one pint of the best port wine. Stir until every par- 
ticle of the isinglass is dissolved, strain through cheese- 
cloth and stand aside until cold. 

SNOW PUDDING 

For an individual serving, cover two teaspoonfuls of 
granulated gelatin with four tablespoonfuls of cold water 
and let it soak a half hour; add a cupful of boiling water, 
four tablespoonfuls of sugar and the juice of a lemon; 
stand aside until it begins to congeal but is not quite stiff. 
Drop in the unbeaten white of one egg, stand the basin in 
a pan of cold water and beat continuously until the mixture 
is as white as snow. Turn at once into a small mold and 



430 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

stand away to harden. Put a half cupful of milk over the 
fire, add the yolk of the egg beaten with a tablespoonful 
of sugar, cook a minute, take from the fire, beat rapidly a 
few minutes with an egg-beater, and turn out to cool. 
Serve the pudding with a sauce poured around it. 

SPANISH CREAM ' 

A half tablespoonful of granulated gelatin soaked in 
a quarter of a cupful of cold water for a half hour; add a 
half cupful of milk and a tablespoonful of sugar, and stir 
the mixture over the fire until the gelatin is dissolved. 
Beat the yolk of an egg with a tablespoonful of sugar, stir 
this into the hot mixture, cook a minute, take from the fire 
and fold in the well-beaten white of the egg; pour at once 
into a small mold to harden. If properly made, this should 
be in layers, with the gelatin at the bottom. It may be 
flavored with a tablespoonful of wine, or if admissible a half 
teaspoonful of vanilla. 



Two level teaspoonfuls of granulated gelatin soaked in 
a tablespoonful of cold water for fifteen minutes ; add four 
tablespoonfuls of hot water, stir until the gelatin is dis- 
solved, add a half cupful of orange juice and a level table- 
spoonful of powdered sugar, stir until the sugar is dissolved 
and stand the mixture aside until it begins to congeal, then 
with an ordinary wire egg-beater beat in the well-beaten 
white of one egg, turn it into a small fancy mold and stand 
away to harden. This may be served plain, or with a little 
extra orange juice. 

Strawberry, blackberry and raspberry juice may be 
used in the same way.

VEGETABLE GELATIN (GELOSE) JELLIES 

I think the fact has been established that, where gela- 
tin or mucilaginous foods are needed, vegetable gelatin is 
to be preferred. It is absolutely free from flavor in itself, 
therefore can be used simply dissolved in water; animal 
gelatin cannot be used in this way on account of the nause- 
ous odor that is intensified by heat. All vegetable gelatins 
that have come under my notice have been very well made. 
They escape the dangers of animal products and the neces- 
sary bleaching and cleansing of animal gelatins which gives 
them a higher food value and removes all danger of un- 
cleanliness. Like Irish moss and similar seaweed prod- 
ucts, it is useful as a vehicle for other foods ; it carries and 
holds wines and other liquors as stimulants if ordered by 
physicians. In all these recipes Kellogg's vegetable gelatin 
has been used. 

It is a well-known fact that animal gelatin is an admir- 
able vehicle for the growth of micro-organisms, which 
makes it necessary to carefully guard all gelatin dishes, 
especially meat jellies. Where acids are used there is very 
little danger of the jelly becoming contaminated. Vege- 
table gelatin answers the purpose of ordinary animal gela- 
tin in all desserts, and when combined with fruit juices, or 
wines, or brandy if ordered, can be kept from one day to 
another without fear of contamination. 

To Prepare Vegetable Gelatin or Gelose A quarter of 
a box of gelose will make four half-pint cupfuls of jelly. 
Wash the gelose through several waters, soak it in warm 
water twenty minutes, wash and drain. Put it in a saucepan 
with one cupful, a half pint, of boiling water, boil slowly, 
stirring every now and then, until the gelose is thoroughly 
dissolved, about ten minutes ; strain through a cheesecloth 
and stand aside until cold. It congeals very quickly and 
without ice. A quarter of this amount will make a half pint, 
two portions, of jelly. 



432 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

ORANGE GELOSE I 

Put one-quarter of the prepared gelose into a small 
saucepan with four tablespoonfuls of water and four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, stir over hot water until thoroughly 
melted, add three-quarters of a cupful of orange juice and 
strain into glasses or molds. 

Currant, raspberry, strawberry and blackberry juice may 
be substituted for orange. Mashed peaches and apple sauce 
may also be used. 

ORANGE GELOSE II 

Put one-quarter of the prepared gelatin into a sauce- 
pan, add four tablespoonfuls of sugar, four tablespoonfuls 
of hot water, and when the gelose is dissolved add two 
tablespoonfuls of lemon juice and two-thirds of a cupful of 
orange juice; turn at once into glasses or molds. 

PINEAPPLE GELOSE 

Pineapple contains an enzyme which digests protein ; 
for this reason, pineapple jelly made with animal gelatin is 
not satisfactory ; in fact, if the gelatin is not chilled before 
the pineapple is added, it will entirely digest the gelatin, 
which keeps it from solidifying. No matter how long it 
stands, it never will form a jelly. 

A good pineapple jelly can be easily made from gelose, 
and without cooking the pineapple. Take the full amount 
of prepared gelose, put it in a saucepan with a cupful of 
warm water and a half cupful of sugar, stir, until the gelose 
is dissolved, take it from the fire and when partly cool add 
one and a half cupfuls of grated pineapple. Turn at once 
into dainty molds to harden. This will keep for several days. 

Use in cases of tonsilitis, quinsy and whooping cough. 

FRUIT GELOSE 

All fruit juices strawberry, raspberry and currant 
mixed, blackberries, mashed ripe peaches, carefully stewed 
apples may be used for fruit jellies. Always prepare the 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 433 

gelose as directed, and remember that a quarter of a box 
will make four cupfuls of jelly. The quantity of sugar must 
be regulated by the acidity of the fruit. The liquid may be 
part water and part fruit juice, or all fruit juice. 

GELOSE DRINK 

Boil half the prepared gelose in one quart of water 
and add the juice of one lemon. This makes an exceed- 
ingly nice drink in fevers, and may be used as a mouth 
swab in place of Irish moss. Gelose drink is good in cases 
of whooping cough. 

RESTORATIVE GELOSE 

Quarter of a box of prepared gelose, a level tablespoon- 
ful of powdered white gum Arabic, two ounces of rock 
candy, all mixed well together; add two cupfuls of cold 
water and stand aside two or three hours. Then stir over 
hot water until the mixture is clear and the ingredients dis- 
solved; take from the fire and cool. Add one and a half 
cupfuls of good sherry, cover the jar or saucepan and let this 
stand over night. In the morning reheat, strain and stand 
aside until cold. This may be put at once into small molds 
or into individual glass dishes.

A FEW DESSERTS 

CEYLON PUDDING 

Two Servings 

Grate one cocoanut, pour over it one pint of boiling 
water, stir for two or three minutes, let it stand until cool 
and wring it through a cheesecloth or bag. Put the cocoa- 
nut "milk" thus made into a double boiler, add the beaten 
yolks of two eggs, cook just a minute until slightly 
thickened, take from the fire and turn into the serving 
dish. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, heap 
them over the top of the pudding and stand it in the oven 
a minute to brown. 

This may be given as a change to diabetic patients. 

COCOANUT CUSTARD 
Two Servings 

Grate and wash a cocoanut as directed in preceding 
recipe. Put the cocoanut "milk" in a double boiler, add a 
'teaspoonful of cornstarch moistened in a little cold water. 
Beat the yolks of two eggs with a tablespoon f til of sugar, 
add them to the hot cocoanut "milk," stir until the thick- 
ness of soft custard, take from the fire and pour at once 
into the serving dish. Beat the whites of the eggs to a 
stiff froth, add two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and 
beat until fine and dry ; heap them over the pudding, brown 
in the oven and stand aside to cool. 

Nice for tuberculosis and the anaemic patients. 

COCOANUT SOUFFLE 

One Serving 

Make the cocoanut milk as directed in Ceylon pud- 
ding, put half of it in a double boiler, add one tablespoon- 
ful of sugar and two teaspoonfuls of cornstarch moistened 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 435 

in a little cold water; cook until thick, and pour while hot 
into the well-beaten white of one egg. Turn at once into 
a mold, and stand aside to harden. Serve with a soft 
custard made from the yolk of the egg. 



FRENCH FLOATING ISLAND 

Put a cupful of milk over the fire in a double boiler. 
Separate one egg, beat the white to a stiff froth, drop it 
by teaspoonfuls over the top of the hot milk, let it remain 
a minute, then lift with a skimmer and put them on 
a plate to cool. Add a level teaspoonful of cornstarch, 
moistened in a little cold milk, cook until the milk is 
slightly thickened, then add the yolk of the egg, beaten 
with a tablespoonful of sugar. When sufficiently thick to 
coat a knife blade, take from the fire, add a half teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla, and turn at once into the serving dish. Heap 
the whites over the top, and stand aside to cool. 

To give variety, if admissible, cover the top of the 
whites of the eggs with three or four almonds that have 
been blanched, dried and chopped fine. 



CARAMEL CUSTARD 

Beat one egg without separating until well mixed, add 
two teaspoonfuls of sugar and a half cupful of milk ; a 
little nutmeg may be added if admissible. Melt two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar in an iron pan ; when it begins to burn 
and brown, add a tablespoonful of water, pour this in the 
bottom of a custard cup, pour the egg and milk on top, 
stand the cup in a small baking pan half filled with hot 
water, and bake in a moderate oven about twenty minutes, 
until they are "set" in the center. To ascertain whether 
or not they are done, run a spoon handle or silver knife 
into the center ; if it comes out clean they are done ; if 
milky, cook longer; if watery, they are overdone. 



436 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

CARAMEL CUSTARD No. 2 

Beat one e'gg with a teaspoonful of sugar for a minute, 
add a half cupful of milk and a teaspoonful of caramel ; turn 
the mixture into a custard cup, stand in a pan of hot water 
and bake until "set" in the center. Serve warm in the cup, 
or turn it out on a saucer. 



ORANGE SOUFFLE PUDDINGS 

Two Servings 

Put a half pint of milk in a double boiler over the 
fire. Moisten a level tablespoonful of flour and a level tea- 
spoonful of cornstarch with four tablespoonfuls of cold 
milk, and when smooth add them gradually to the hot 
milk, stirring all the while ; when thick take from the fire 
and add the yolks of two eggs, mix, and stir in carefully 
the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Brush individual bak- 
ing dishes with a little butter, put in the mixture, stand 
them in a shallow pan half filled with boiling water, and 
bake in a quick oven fifteen minutes. While these are 
baking, mix a teaspoonful of sugar with a teaspoonful of 
flour, add a half cupful of boiling water and a half teaspoon- 
ful of grated yellow rind of orange ; bring to boiling point, 
add a tablespoonful of orange juice and strain. Serve in a 
little pitcher, on the tray, with the hot souffle. 



OMELET SOUFFLE 

Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, add the 
beaten yolk of one egg, a teaspoonful of powdered sugar, a 
half teaspoonful of lemon juice, and heap at once in an indi- 
vidual baking dish or a tiny platter, dust thickly with pow- 
dered sugar, and bake in a quick oven three minutes. 

Caution The oven must be ready before you begin to 
make the souffle. If the souffle is stringy you have baked 
it too long. It must be smoking hot, but soft and light. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 437 

MARLBOROUGH CUSTARDS 

Press one left-over baked apple through a sieve, add a 
teaspoonful of sugar, one egg, well beaten, and a half cup- 
ful of milk. Turn this into a baking or custard cup and 
bake in a moderate oven until "set" in the center. Serve 
warm or cold. 

RICE PUDDING WITH MALT 

Put two tablespoonfuls of rice into one quart of milk, 
add a teaspoonful of malt extract and a tablespoonful of 
sugar. Bake slowly one hour, stirring down the crust two 
or three times. When done it should be about the con- 
sistency of good cream. 

PEACH CREAM 

Pare one large, very ripe, mellow peach, press it through 
a colander, using a silver spoon, or put it quickly through 
an ordinary vegetable press. Add a tablespoonful of pow- 
dered sugar, and fold in quickly ;six tablespoonfuls of 
cream whipped to a stiff froth. Heap at once into a pretty 
stem glass dessert dish, dust with powdered sugar and 
serve. 

BANANA CREAM 

Pare one very ripe banana; the skin must be almost 
black, but the flesh must be sweet and good. Whip it 
quickly with an egg-beater, add a teaspoonful of powdered 
sugar and a tablespoonful of orange juice, and then fold in 
six tablespoonfuls of cream whipped to a stiff froth ; dust 
with powdered sugar and serve at 'once. 

PRUNE CREAM 

(Recipe for this will be found under "Prunes.") 

PINEAPPLE CREAM 

Mash half of a baked apple through a colander, add 
two tablespoonfuls of grated fresh pineapple, a tablespoon- 



438 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

ful of powdered sugar and six tablespoonfuls of cream 
whipped to a stiff froth ; dish and serve at once. 

PINEAPPLE ALBUMIN DESSERT 

Grate sufficient ripe pineapple to make four tablespoon- 
fuls; add a teaspoonful of sugar and stir in quickly the 
well-beaten whites of two eggs ; heap this into an individual 
glass dessert dish, dust with powdered sugar and serve at 
once. This cannot stand even fifteen minutes ; the pine- 
apple will digest the albumin, which will make it bitter. 

TAPIOCA JELLY 

Wash through several cold waters a half cupful of 
granulated tapioca, cover it with one quart of cold water, 
soak over night in the refrigerator, or for two 'or three 
hours in a cold place. Turn it into a saucepan and add 
the juice of one lemon, a saltspoonful of salt, a pint of boil- 
ing water and a cupful of sugar; stir carefully over the 
fire until it reaches the boiling point, push it over a mild 
fire and cook fifteen minutes. Turn at once into molds and 
stand away to harden. Instead of adding the extra pint 
of water, wine may be added, but the cooking must be 
done before the wine is added. 

This will be sufficient to last several days, and is a 
very easily digested form of starch. With cream this makes 
an admirable dessert for "bloodless" girls or in cases of 
anaemia, where both starch and fatty matter are called 
for. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 439 

PUDDING SAUCES 

SAUCE SABAYON 

Put a half pint of sherry in a double boiler, add a level 
teaspoonful of cornstarch moistened in a little cold milk, 
cook until the thickness of cream, add the yolk of one egg 
beaten with a tablespoonful of sugar, cook a minute, take 
from the fire and stand aside to cool. When cool, add the 
rasping of an orange. 

SOFT CUSTARD SAUCE 

Put one gill (a half cupful) of milk in a saucepan, 
stand it over hot water until it is scalding hot. Beat the 
yolk of one egg with two teaspoonfuls of sugar, add the 
hot milk, return to the saucepan, stir over hot water until 
it will "coat" or cover a knife blade ; be careful not to 
curdle. Take from the fire, and when cool, flavor. 

PLAIN PUDDING SAUCE 

Beat the yolks of two eggs until creamy, add slowly 
a half pint of boiling water, cook over the fire a minute, 
pour while hot into the well-beaten whites of the eggs, 
add a tablespoonful of powdered sugar and a tablespoon- 
ful of sherry or brandy, or this sauce may be flavored with 
the juice and a little grated rind of orange or lemon. 

COCOANUT SAUCE 

Follow the preceding recipe, using cocoanut milk in 
place of plain water. Or use cocoanut milk in place of 
cows' milk in a soft custard sauce or Sabayon. 

COCOANUT CREAM SAUCE 

Stand cocoanut milk in a cold place over night. In 
the morning take off the cream, put it in a bowl and beat 
with an egg beater until it is light and frothy; heap it in 
a glass dish, and stand on the ice to harden. Use on gelatin, 
or fruit puddings in cases of diabetes or tuberculosis. 



440 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

NUT CREAM SAUCES 

Stir two rounding tablespoonfuls of nut butter into a 
half cupful of boiling water. Use plain, or slightly 
sweetened. For diabetic patients, however, it must be 
used without thickening or sugar. If it is too thick to 
pour, add boiling water. Almond paste or almond butter 
is preferable to other nut butters. 

FRUIT JUICE SAUCE 

Simply express the juice of any fresh fruit, and use 
it at once. These fruit juices are palatable over gelatin 
desserts in cases of diabetes or obesity ; they may be 
thickened and used for pudding sauces for invalidism, 
children, or the aged. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 441 

ICE CREAM 

Among the ordinary nurses' outfit is a small pint ice 
cream freezer; these are not expensive, and only require 
four or five tablespoonfuls of salt and a pound of ice to 
freeze a pint or less. If such freezers cannot be purchased, 
fit a tall quart kettle into a bowl or into a larger tin kettle, 
and stand it aside to use for freezing cream and sherbets 
for the sick. While this is an old-fashioned way, if the 
kettle is twisted back and forward and the mixture stirred 
down from the sides every few minutes, it takes but a short 
time to freeze a pint of cream. 

In many cases a little frozen cream, unsweetened and 
unflavored, is acceptable and pleasing to the patient. In 
fever, frozen fruit juices or sherbets allay thirst. 

Pack the freezer or kettle with fine salt and ice, in the 
proportions pf two-thirds ice and one-third salt. For small 
freezers, use ordinary table salt if coarse salt is not at 
hand. Put the cream in the freezer, turn it slowly at first 
until the cream is icy cold, then freeze quickly. 

A tablespoonful of coffee, or a suspicion of chocolate, 
or a tablespoonful of sherry, used as flavoring, are always 
preferable to vanilla. 

ICE CREAMS AND SORBETS 

Add a tablespoonful of sugar to a half cupful of good 
cream; when the sugar is dissolved put the mixture into 
the ice cream freezer and stir until it is frozen. 

Coffee Ice Cream Add a teaspoonful of sugar and a 
tablespoonful of black coffee to a half cupful of cream ; 
freeze, 

Lemon Sorbet Take a rasping of the yellow rind from 
a lemon, put it, with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, into one 
cupful of boiling water, boil about two minutes, strain, 
and add the juice of a lemon. When the mixture is very 
cold, .freeze it, turning constantly until it is frozen. The 
mixture should be light and white. 



442 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

Orange Sorbet^ Make the same as lemon sorbet, using 
a half cupful of water with the sugar and grated yellow 
rind of a quarter of the orange. Boil and strain, and when 
cold add a half pint of orange juice, and freeze. 

Pineapple Sorbet Boil the sugar and water together, 
strain, take from the fire, and when cool add a half cupful 
of grated fresh pineapple, and freeze. 

Grape Sorbet Add four tablespoonfuls of water to 
eight tablespoonfuls of grape juice, and freeze. 

Mint Sorbet Boil two tablespoonfuls of sugar with a 
half pint of water for two minutes, add the leaves from 
four stalks of mint, chopped fine and pounded to a pulp. 
Stand this aside and let it steep slowly twenty minutes, 
press through a fine sieve, and when cold freeze. 

All fruit juices may be slightly sweetened and frozen. 
For fever cases freeze them without sugar they are 
grateful and beneficial. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 443 

BEVERAGES AND WATER GRUELS 

Under this heading I shall not place simply tea and 
coffee, but all demulcent, nutritive, diuretic and refrigerant 
drinks. 



Put two ounces of pearl barley into a porcelain-lined 
or granite saucepan, add a quart of boiling water, boil for 
five minutes, strain, throw the water away ; add two quarts 
of boiling water to the barley, cover and simmer for two 
hours. Skim frequently, and when done strain through a 
fine sieve and it is ready for use. 

The first water is simply to cleanse the barley, and 
should not be retained. 

In cases where plain milk does not agree perfectly with 
the individual or child, barley water may be added to ad- 
vantage in proportion one-third barley water to two-thirds 
milk. 

As a liquid starchy food use its sweetened and flavored 
with lemon juice or wine. 

RICE WATER 

Make precisely the same as barley water, substituting 
two ounces of rice. 

OATMEAL WATER 

This is best made from Irish or other coarse oats. If 
you use rolled oats, measure carefully two level tablespoon- 
fuls. Sprinkle it into a pint of boiling water without 
stopping the boiling; boil rapidly thirty minutes and strain 
through a fine sieve. Add a pinch of salt and stand aside 
to cool. Use the same as barley water. 

TOAST WATER 

Toast, to a dark brown, one slice of bread ; put it in a 
bowl, poor over one quart of boiling water, cover and 
stand aside until cool. When cold strain and it is ready to 



444 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

use. If admissible, a few drops of lemon juice may be 
added, but no sugar. 

APPLE WATER 

Select a perfect, tart apple, remove the core and 
roast the apple to a dark brown ; put it in a pitcher, pour 
over a quart of boiling water, stand aside until perfectly 
cold. Strain and it is ready for use. 

TAMARIND WATER 

Pour one pint of 'boiling water over two ounces of 
tamarinds ; when cool strain and use. 

This is exceedingly grateful in fevers, and is slightly 
laxative. 

LEMONADE I 

Boil for two minutes two tablespoonfuls of sugar in 
a half pint of water, with a bit of the yellow rind of a lemon. 
Strain, and when cool add four tablespoonfuls of lemon 
juice. Stand this near the ice, where it will get perfectly 
cold. 

LEMONADE II 

Grate the yellow rind from three lemons; add this to 
one pound of loaf sugar; add a quart of water, bring to a 
boil, skim and boil five minutes; add to this the juice of 
six lemons; strain, put into a glass jar and keep it in a 
cool place to use as needed. 

Fill a tumbler half full of this mixture, then fill, with 
either carbonated, Apollinaris water, or plain water. It 
makes an exceedingly nice, cooling drink. 

EGG LEMONADE 

Separate one egg, beat the white to a stiff froth, add 
the yolk and beat again. Pour into this slowly, a glass of 
well-made lemonade. Or, the egg may be dropped into a 
glass of lemonade and the whole shaken thoroughly 
together. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 445 

LEMON SQUASH 

Put into a tumbler two tablespoonfuls of lemon water 
ice, and fill the tumbler from a siphon of soda water. In 
out of town places plain soda may be purchased in bottles. 
A siphon is always to be recommended, as after a bottle 
of soda is opened, the remaining quantity must be thrown 
away. 

LIMEADE 

Pare the lime carefully, cut it into halves, squeeze the 
juice into a tumbler. Stir two teaspoonfuls of powdered 
sugar in a glass of water, when the sugar is dissolved, add 
the lime juice. Add ice if necessary. 

Add syrup to the lime juice and siphon the tumbler 
full of soda, and you will have Lime Squash. 



IRISH MOSS WATER 

Wash thoroughly a half ounce of Irish moss and soak 
it in a pint (eight ounces) of water for two hours. Boil 
ten minutes and strain. You should now have a thick, 
mucilaginous water. Boil two tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
a half pint of water together for two minutes; when cool 
add the Irish moss water and the juice of a good-sized 
lemon, and stand aside for use. 

This is exceedingly grateful to persons with throats 
irritated from coughing. Omit sugar and use for whooping 
cough, quinsy and tonsilitis. 

SLIPPERY ELM TEA 

Use a half ounce of powdered slippery elm to a pint 
of water; soak for a half hour, bring to a boil, boil two 
minutes, and strain through a fine sieve or cheesecloth. Add 
the juice of a lemon and stand aside to cool. 

In fever cases this makes a good swab mixture for the 
mouth. 



446 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

OLD-FASHIONED FEVER DRINK 

l /2 pint of red currants, fully ripe I quart of water 
l /2 pint of raspberries, fully ripe 

Mash the currants and raspberries together; strain 
them carefully through a jelly bag or two thicknesses of 
cheesecloth. Wash the residue in the given quantity of 
water, strain again and add it to the first juice. Stand in a 
cold place to keep. Ice may be added, or not, as directed. 



GELATIN WATER 

Pare the yellow rind from one lemon and put it in a 
good-sized pitcher; add the lemon sliced, one ounce of loaf 
sugar, one pint of boiling water, one tablespoonful (a quar- 
ter of an ounce) of granulated gelatin that has soaked in 
two ounces of cold water for a half hour ; cover the pitcher 
and let it stand until the contents are cold. Strain through 
a fine sieve or cheesecloth. Use in fever cases. 



ORANGE PEEL TEA 

Pare the thin rind from one orange, put it in a pitcher, 
add two ounces of sugar and one quart of boiling water; 
cover and stand aside to cool. When cold, strain, add a 
tablespoonful of orange juice and it is ready for use. 

LINSEED OR FLAXSEED TEA 

Put one ounce of linseed, crushed, and two drams 
of licorice root into a jug, pour over a pint of water, cover 
and stand in a pan of hot water, at a temperature of 200 
Fahr. for three hours. Strain through two thicknesses of 
cheesecloth and cool. 

This is exceedingly good to allay irritation from cough- 
ing, or for persons with pulmonary troubles. The flavor- 
ing may be changed by adding at one time lemon and at 
another orange. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 447 

GUM ARABIC WATER 

Soak a half ounce of white powdered gum Arabic in 
a quart of cold water for at least two hours, or over night. 
Add' a bit of lemon peel, in the morning, stand the pitcher 
in a saucepan of hot water and stir until the gum is dis- 
solved. Strain through two thicknesses of cheesecloth. 

This is nice in febrile or inflammatory complaints. 

BRAN WATER 

Wash two ounces of bran through several cold waters, 
add two ounces of loaf sugar and one quart of cold water ; 
bring to a boil, boil continuously five minutes, strain and 
use either hot or cold. Cream or milk may be added, if 
admissible. 

To give this the flavor of cereal coffee, the bran may 
be toasted thoroughly, then added to the water and boiled; 
omit the washing. 

CINNAMON TEA 

Break a half ounce of stick cinnamon into small pieces, 
put them in an earthen or granite pitcher, add one pint of 
boiling water, cover and stand* it on the back part of the 
stove for ten minutes. Strain and it is ready for use. An 
astringent drink in cases of diarrhoea. 

LIME WATER 

Put a piece of unslaked lime, about the size of an or- 
dinary chicken's egg, into a large granite or porcelain-lined 
kettle; pour over two quarts of boiling water; stir until 
the water ceases to boil from the action of the lime; then 
let it stand until perfectly clear; drain off carefully, bottle 
and cork. 

JELLY WATER 

Put two tablespoonfuls of currant jelly into a half pint 
of boiling water, mash and work the jelly until it is dis- 
solved, and strain it at once into a tumbler. Put near the 



448 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

ice to cool, add a little finely-shaved ice and use in fever 
cases. 

BLACK CURRANT JELLY WATER 

Use the same quantity of black currant instead of red 
currant jelly. Beneficial in cases' of chronic diarrhoea. 

FRESH GRAPE DRINK 

Wash two pounds of Concord grapes; pulp them, put 
the pulp in a granite saucepan, bring to boiling point, and 
press them through a sieve sufficiently fine to remove the 
seeds. Add this pulp to the skins, add one quart of water 
and simmer gently for a half hour. Strain, and stand aside 
to cool. 

GRAPE SQUASH 

Put two ounces of grape juice in a tumbler and fill the 
tumbler from a siphon of plain soda. 

Orange juice, strawberry juice or currant juice may be 
substituted for grape juice, according to the condition and 
fancy of the patient. 

IMPERIAL WATER 

Dissolve a level teaspoonful of cream of tartar in a 
half pint of cold water. Add the grated yellow rind from 
a quarter of a lemon and four tablespoonfuls of sugar to 
a half pint of boiling water, boil three minutes ; and when 
cool strain into the cream of tartar water, and stand aside 
to use as a diuretic drink. To serve, fill a tumbler half 
full of this mixture, and fill it with plain water. 

EVANS'S TEA GRUEL 

Put one tablespoonful of gunpowder tea in a china or 
earthen pitcher, pour over one pint of freshly-boiled soft 
water. Cover the pitcher for ten minutes. Boil six lumps 
of cut loaf sugar with eight tablespoonfuls of water, strain 
the tea into this, add a grated nutmeg and stand aside to 
cool. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 449 

This is valuable in cases of summer complaint for chil- 
dren, also in cases of diarrhoea. 

A tablespoonful three or four times a day is considered 
a dose. 

WELSH NECTAR 

Put one pound of seeded raisins, three lemons cut into 
slices, and two pounds of granulated sugar into two gallons 
of boiling water; cover and stand aside one week, stirring 
every day. Strain through a jelly bag, bottle, cork and 
stand in the cold. This will keep in a cold place for a month. 

WILD CHERRY CORDIAL 

Pick ripe wild cherries from the stems, put one quart 
in a two-quart jar, cover with the best Bourbon whisky, 
screw on the top and stand the jar away ; shake two or 
three times a week for four weeks. Drain off the whisky, 
pressing the cherries. Boil two cupfuls of sugar with one 
cupful of water for five minutes, when cold add it to the 
whiskey, bottle, cork and seal. Use in chronic diarrhoea and 
dysentery. 

TEA 

Tea is an aromatic beverage quite popular arn,ong the 
English. Scotch and Irish. It contains an alkaloid, thein, 
which is almost identical to caffein. While there is a sim- 
ilarity in the effects of tea and coffee, there is also a de- 
cided difference, due, no doubt, to the essential oils and 
the greater amount 9f tannin in tea. The aroma of tea, like 
that of coffee, is due to a volatile oil, which is' driven off 
and dissipated if the tea is boiled. Boiling spoils tea more, 
if possible, than it does coffee ; it not only drives off the 
aroma, but it dissolves and draws out a greater amount of 
tannin. Green teas contain more thein and volatile oils, 
and less tannin than black teas. Young Hyson is perhaps 
the best of the Chinese green teas, and Pekoe the best of 
the black. Good black teas from Ceylon and India are sold 
in the American markets from fifty cents to a dollar and 

29 



450 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

a quarter a pound. Fancy scented teas, like orange Pekoe, 
are expensive, not because they are better than ordinary 
teas, but because they are flavored. Tea, like coffee, must 
be selected, and must never be purchased from an open 
box. No matter what variety you use Ceylon, Gunpowder, 
Young Hyson, Imperial or English Breakfast Tea, see that it 
comes to you in a package unopened. 

To Make the Infusion Rinse the teakettle, fill it with 
clean cold water, bring it quickly to a boil. Scald the 
pot, which should be made of china or granite, turn out the 
hot water, put in a teaspoonful of tea to each half pint of 
tea needed, pour over the freshly-boiled water, cover the pot, 
put over a cozy or napkin, let it stand, away from the 
fire, five minutes, stir, and it is ready for use. 

Like coffee, tea must be poured at once from the 
grounds. Any form of teapot that will lift the grounds 
from the water after the tea is steeped is to be recom- 
mended. The S. Y. P. teapot is easily used and cleaned. 
In the upper part of the pot there is a compartment with a 
perforated bottom; the tea is put into this, the teapot is 
tipped on the side and filled with water; as soon as the tea 
is steeped the pot is adjusted, which lifts the grounds from 
the water. The small, cheap Chinese teapots, with perco- 
lator, are preferable to the old-fashioned pots. A Chinese 
tea basket is attractive and sightly, and makes good tea, 
providing you lift the grounds from the water. A Japanese 
or English tea cozy should be used to keep the tea warm 
while it is steeping and after you pour the first cup. 

ICED TEA 

Iced tea is not to be recommended for the sick at 
least I cannot think of any disease in which it would be 
especially advantageous. If, however, it is ordered, make 
the tea according to the preceding recipe, using double 
quantity of tea. Fill a glass two-thirds full of finely- 
cracked ice, put in a teaspoonful of powdered sugar, pour 
over the hot tea ; stir, and serve with it a quarter of a lemon. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 451 

COFFEE 

Coffee removes the sensation of fatigue more quickly 
than any other stimulant. It allays hunger and strengthens 
the heart action to a marked degree ; for this reason it must 
be used in moderation. 

The aroma of coffee is due to caffeol, an oil liberated 
or created in the roasting. The stimulating effect is due to 
the caffein. Taken at night, even in a small quantity, it 
frequently produces insomnia. Persons in health may 
drink coffee in moderation, to their advantage, providing 
they do not take it with meals or with solid foods. Black 
coffee taken at the end of the meal is better than coffee 
with sugar and cream. To get the full effect of coffee, to 
have it do its work properly, one should take it alone, early 
in the morning, forty minutes before the regular breakfast. 
In tropical countries, coffee is brought to one's bedside at 
five o'clock in the morning; the general first meal of the 
day is not served until six-thirty, and coffee is not repeated 
at this meal. 

Coffee is injurious when it is boiled for a long time and 
taken with sugar and cream ; it always produces flatulency, 
and later on intestinal troubles. If taken at all, it must be 
freshly made, and taken with scalded, not boiled, milk, and 
sipped slowly. I observe throughout the country that most 
of the dyspeptics are found among people who take a 
mouthful of bread and butter and then a swallow of coffee, 
or who dip their bread in coffee to soften it. A diet of this 
kind is a sure road to destruction. 

It makes very little difference how much you pay for 
coffee if the infusion is carelessly made. Do not buy coffee 
shoveled from an open bin, in which it has been kept, un- 
covered, for a week or two after roasting. It has not only 
lost its flavor, but is possibly covered with dust, and under 
no circumstances will make a good infusion. 



452 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

THE PERFECT CUP OF COFFEE 

To make a perfect cup of coffee three things are neces- 
sary : 

1. Clean water, freshly boiled, in a clean teakettle. 
If the water is soft it must be taken at the first boil ; if 
hard, boil ten minutes. 

2.. A good percolating pot, one that will hold the 
ground coffee above the water. 

3. A good quality of coffee, carefully selected and 
cleaned, dry roasted and finely ground. Pulverized coffee is 
economical and good if the cook and housewife know how 
to use it, but unless percolated through a muslin bag or a 
hair percolator, the coffee is bitter and muddy. 

The coffee pot must be washed and scalded every day, 
rinsed thoroughly and dried. 

For breakfast coffee use scalded, not boiled milk. Do 
not use cream. I am speaking now from the standpoint of 
health. Hot coffee poured into cream makes a mixture that 
nine out of ten times produces "sour stomach" and 
flatulency. 

Allow one tablespoonful of ground coffee to each half 
pint of boiling water. To begin ; rinse the teakettle thor- 
oughly, fill it with cold water, stand it over a quick fire 
and bring to boiling point. Scald the pot, let it stand a 
minute, empty out the water, put in the desired quantity of 
coffee and pour through slowly the given quantity of boil- 
ing water. If you are making coffee for one person, use a 
small pot, otherwise the grounds will be distributed in too 
thin a layer over the percolator. Do not allow the infusion 
to stand even five minutes after it is made ; use at once, 
or it loses its flavor and becomes bitter. In percolated 
coffee one gets the aroma in the infusion ; if coffee is boiled, 
the aroma is driven off and the decoction is usually bitter. 

If you use an alcohol pot with a glass top, scald the 
under part of the pot, fill it with fresh boiling water and 
adjust the glass top, put in the given quantity of coffee, 
cover, light the lamp and allow the water to pass through 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 453 

the coffee for at least five minutes. Turn down the lamp 
to keep the coffee hot until served. The grounds are so 
far above the coffee that they need not be removed. If 
coffee is made in the kitchen, percolated in a bag or in a 
"second story" pot, it should be lifted from the pot as soon 
as percolated. A few drops coming from the stale grounds 
will spoil the flavor of the whole potful. 

A funnel-shaped haircloth bag that can be purchased 
at any house-furnishing store, hung in a china pitcher or 
pot, makes a good percolator. Both pot and bag must be 
scalded before the ground coffee is put in. 



BOILED COFFEE 

If a percolator is not at hand, and you must make 
boiled coffee, see that the utensil in which you are to make 
it is perfectly clean. Rinse the teakettle, start with water 
freshly boiling, scald the pot, empty out the water, put in 
the coffee, allowing a heaping tablespoonful to each half 
pint of water ; add a very little white of egg and sufficient 
cold water to moisten the coffee ; pour over the bailing 
water, stand the pot over a quick fire, watch it carefully 
until it reaches boiling point, lift it from the- fire, put it 
down and let it boil again ; lift it again, bring to a boil the 
third time ; throw in a tablespoonful of cold water, if making 
a single cup, and let it stand a moment until the grounds 
have thoroughly settled. Heat a tiny pitcher or pot with 
hot water, empty it out, drain the coffee into the pitcher 
and cover. Have ready the same amount of scalding, not 
boiled milk ; put them on the tray and carry at once to the 
patient. 

DISHES FLAVORED WITH COFFEE 

If it becomes necessary to continue the use of coffee, 
it may be administered in many ways besides the regular 
infusion. Two tablespoonfuls of black coffee may be stirred 
into well-beaten egg, or a little whipped cream. 



454 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

COFFEE JELLY 

Cover ' a teaspoonful of granulated gelatin with two 
tablespoonfuls of water, let it soak ten minutes, add a half 
cupful of boiling coffee, stir in a tablespoonful of sugar 
and turn at once into an individual mold. Serve with plain 
or whipped cream. 

COFFEE VELVET CREAM 

Make coffee jelly, according to the preceding recipe, 
and when cold and slightly thick stir into it four table- 
spoonfuls of cream whipped to a stiff froth. 

COFFEE MOUSSE 

Beat the yolk of one egg with two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar until light ; stir into it a half cupful of boiling coffee, 
stir over the fire just a minute, take from the fire, and when 
cold fold in carefully six tablespoonfuls of cream whipped 
to a stiff froth. Put this into a tiny kettle or mold and 
stand it in a pan of cracked ice and salt, for two hours. 
See that the mold has a tight cover, to prevent the entrance 
of the salt water. 

FROZEN COFFEE 

Sweeten a cup of coffee, and turn it into a small indi- 
vidual freezer ; pack with salt and ice, and stir slowly until 
frozen like wet snow. Serve in a glass. This is also called 
cafe frappe. 

COFFEE SHERBET 

This is made precisely like frappe; except stir rapidly 
until the mixture is frozen. 

COFFEE ICE CREAM 

Dissolve a tablespoonful of sugar in a half cupful of 
strong black coffee ; when perfectly cold add an equal 
quantity of thick cream. Freeze, stirring slowly all the 
while. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 455 

ICED COFFEE 

Fill the serving tumbler half full of clean cracked ice, 
pour over half a cupful of boiling coffee; this coffee must 
be made fresh, the same as tea; it must not be a second 
boiling, and must not stand until it is cold ; it must be 
quickly chilled. Season with cream and sugar, if admissible. 

CHOCOLATE (Theobromin) 

While chocolate contains an alkaloid, theobromin, which 
is almost identical with caffein, it differs very much from 
coffee in its other constituents. The aroma of tea and 
coffee are driven off by boiling, while the aroma and food 
value of chocolate is enhanced by boiling. Chocolate is 
made from the beans or seeds of the cacao tree. These 
seeds grow in a large fleshy pod, from a "cushion" on the 
trunk of the tree. The fruit is imbedded in a white pulp, 
rather sour and pleasant to the taste. After the seeds or 
beans are taken from the shells they are thrown in a bin, 
covered and allowed to ferment, then they are dried in 
the sun, and polished by "dancing." In some places a 
sort of red clay is put over the bean after the first drying 
and before the dancing, which gives it a red polished sur- 
face. These seeds or beans must be roasted to develop 
the aroma and essential oils. After they are roasted, the 
shells are removed, the "beans" are ground and the fat 
extracted. The residue is made into the various prepara- 
tions known as chocolate, cocoa, and theobroma. 

Cocoa is the dry residue after the cacao butter has been 
pressed out. The cacao butter amounts to forty or fifty 
per cent, of the weight of the beans ; there is also about 
fifteen per cent, of starch, considerable mineral matter 
and albuminous substances. One can see that cocoa is a 
nutritious food, rather than a beverage, and cannot be 
substituted for tea or coffee. 

Chocolate is manufactured from the ground and fat- 
free cacao bean, with sugar, flavoring, and sometimes other 
substances added. 



456 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

The following table, which was adapted from Konig, 
will show the reader the difference between the cacao beans 
and chocolate, and while in this table there seems to be 
no starch in the chocolate, it certainly is wise to boil it.

TO MAKE CHOCOLATE 

Grate sufficient chocolate to make a tablespoonful, put 
it in a saucepan with a half pint of boiling water, stir it 
until it reaches boiling point, boil two minutes, add a tea- 
spoonful of granulated sugar, stir until the sugar is dis- 
solved, add one cupful of milk, stir until the milk is scald- 
ing hot, take from the fire, turn into the chocolate pot and 
serve it with whipped cream. 



TO MAKE CHOCOLATE SYRUP 

If chocolate is to be used as a daily beverage, it is 
wise to make syrup and put it aside in a cold place. 

Grate a half pound of chocolate, put it in a saucepan 
with one quart of boiling water, stir until it reaches boiling 
point, boil ten minutes, add one cupful of granulated sugar, 
stir and boil five minutes longer, take from the fire, add a 
teaspoonful of vanilla, and when cold put it into a jar, cover 
and keep in a cold place. 

When wanted for use, heat a cupful of milk, add one 
or two tablespoonfuls of chocolate syrup, beat rapidly, put 
a little whipped cream on top and serve. 



MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 457 

MEXICAN CHOCOLATE 

After the syrup and milk are well mixed, add a quarter 
of a teaspoonful of vanilla, a drop of extract of cinnamon 
and one of allspice. Whip it over the fire for three minutes 
and serve without whipped cream. 

COCOA 

Put one cupful of milk in a double boiler over the fire. 
Moisten one level tablespoonful of cocoa in a little cold 
milk, add the scalding milk, return to the double boiler, 
stir until the cocoa is thoroughly moistened, cover the 
boiler and cook about two minutes. Sweeten and serve 
with whipped cream. 

Broma and Alkathrepta are made precisely the same as 
cocoa. 

ICED COCOA 

Put one teaspoonful of cocoa into a saucepan, add grad- 
ually two ounces of cold water, bring to a boil, boil a 
minute, add four ounces of milk, take from the. fire and 
stand near the ice until it is perfectly cold. Sweeten and 
turn into the serving glass, and if admissible add a little 
shaved ice and a tablespoonful of whipped cream. 

Chocolate may be substituted for cocoa. 

COCOA FROM THE NIBS 

Boil two hours a half cupful of the broken cocoa in a 
farina boiler, with two quarts of water. To serve, add an 
equal quantity of hot milk. The first mixture will keep for 
two days. 

RACAHOUT POWDER 

i pound of rice flour i pound of cocoa 

I pound of confectioners' XXX 2 ounces of arrowroot 

sugar 2 ounces of sugar of milk 

i ounce of powdered saJep I vanilla bean 

Mix and thoroughly rub together, put into glass jars 
and fasten. 



458 MRS. RORER'S DIET FOR THE SICK 

TO MAKE RACAHOUT 

Vz pint of milk i level tablespoonful of racahout 

I teaspoonful of sugar powder 

Put the milk over the fire in a double boiler, moisten 
the racahout powder in a little cold milk, add it to the hot 
milk, stir until it thickens, add the sugar, and serve with a 
tablespoonful of whipped cream on the top. 



RACAHOUT BLANCMANGE 

Three Servings 

Put one pint of milk in a double boiler, moisten two 
tablespoonfuls of racahout and one of rice flour in a little 
cold milk, add it to the hot milk, stir until it thickens, add a 
half cupful of sugar, and turn into small molds to harden. 
Serve with plain cream. 

MATE 

This is frequently called Paraguay tea, and is made 
from the dried leaves and small twigs of the ilex Para- 
guayensis, a tree closely allied to our ordinary holly tree. 
Mate contains a large amount of thein, and is valuable in 
exhaustion. It must be percolated the same as coffee. 
The better method is to make a funnel-shaped bag, put a 
wire or rod around the top, fit it to a china pitcher; scald 
the pitcher and bag, put a teaspoonful of mate in the bag, 
pour through a half pint of boiling water, lift the bag, and 
the infusion is ready for use. Serve plain or with sugar. 

According to Pavy mate contains an astringent prin- 
ciple analogous to tannin, a volatile oil, and thein amounting 
to i. 20 per cent. 

Mate is by far a greater nerve stimulant than Chinese 
tea, and should not be used to excess. 

The writer has used it in cases of alcoholism with 
good results. Cold or hot, it allays the craving for alcohol.
