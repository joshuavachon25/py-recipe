RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 



o*«o 



CHAPTER I 

GENERAL RELATIONS OF EMPLOYERS AND SERVANTS IN 
THE HOME AND BEFORE THE LAW 

Befobb the law of this country servants of various kinds 
stand upon the same footing. The term of service is to be 
determined by the agreement between employer and employee, 
between master and man, between mistress and maid. The 
usual engagement is for a week's trial ; if both are suited, the 
arrangement is to go on by the month. If the contract is for a 
term longer than a year, it should be put in writing or it will be 
invalid. 

Importance of Clear Understanding between Employer and 
Employed at the Time of Engagement 

A clear understanding between master and servant at the 
time of the engagement is most important. 

A servant has a right to ask questions about the place in a 
respectful manner, and he should gain all the information he 
legitimately can about the character and demands of the house- 
hold to which he thinks of going. Masters cannot expect 
efficient servants to be indifferent to the duties they are under- 
taking, and to their surroundings while performing those duties. 

3 



4 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

A servant should tell what he or she expects as a part of his 
place — to help and not to hinder him in the performance of his 
duties. For instance, a lady's maid has a right to a sewing 
room, and a valet to a room where he may press his master's 
clothes, free from the possible interference of other servants. In 
arranging for a place and its duties these matters should all be 
forecast, considered, and definitely settled. 

But a servant should not have a right to dictate what he or 
she will or will not do. The employer has the right of naming 
duties. Servants are at liberty to accept them or not, as they 
wish. 

Liability of a Servant to discharge under Differing 
Circumstances 

The servant may be lawfully discharged before the expira- 
tion of his or her term for immoral conduct, wilful disobedience 
of orders, gross incompetence to perform his duty, etc. Intoxi- 
cation, for example, is a sufficient cause for dismissal. In such 
cases the servant is paid wages for the period he or she has 
served, and not for the entire month. 

If the servant is discharged unjustly, and without sufficient 
cause, before the expiration of his or her term, he or she is 
entitled to a week's or a month's wages. In other words, if a 
master or mistress, without just cause, discharges a servant 
before his or her month expires, the servant is entitled to wages 
in full for the week or month, as the arrangement for service 
and wages may be. If, on the other hand, an employer has 
occasion to speak to a servant for neglect of duty, and the ser- 
vant says he or she will leave at once, the employer has a perfect 
right to withhold all wages for the week or month. A servant 
should give the employer proper notice before leaving. If the 
servant is employed by the month, at least one week's notice 
is necessary, and if by the week, not less than two or three 



RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 5 

If a servant leaves without proper notice and before his 
month expires, unless through sickness or because of some acci- 
dent, he forfeits his wages for the month. 

Wages which may be claimed in Case of Abrupt Dismissal 
or Voluntary Leaving 

If a servant employed in a family hears of another situation 
and, without the employer's consent, leaves at once, or on the 
following day, he or she forfeits claim to wages of his or her 
week or month. In many cases servants are influenced by 
friends in such precipitate action, and should realize they do an 
I injustice to themselves as well as to their employer. 

An employer may engage a servant on one week's trial and, 
at the end of the week, both may be satisfied. But if later, per- 
haps in the second or third week, the servant becomes careless, 
neglects duties, and when reproved replies impertinently, the 
employer may discharge him or her with wages to date. 

The Question of References 

As a general rule a master is not obliged to give a reference, 
and statements in regard to the character of servants, to those 
who intend to employ them, are generally regarded as privileged 
communications. In other words, a master or mistress is not 
bound to give a servant a character or letter of recommendation. 
If such is given, it should be truthful. If the servant is not a 
good one, care must be used in the wording of the reference. 

Penalty for forging a Reference by Self or Proxy 

A reference made by a person with malicious intent and con- 
taining false statements calculated to injure and harm the servant 
would be libelous and not privileged. 

A servant obtaining employment by any false or forged letter 
or certificate of recommendation is guilty of a misdemeanor. A 



6 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

misdemeanor is punishable by imprisonment in a penitentiary, 
or county jail, for not more than one year, or by a fine of not 
more than $500, or by both. 

Penalty for personating an Employer 

Any individual who personates a master or mistress and 
gives a servant a character is liable to punishment. A servant 
altering a written character, or offering a false one from a person 
representing a master or mistress, is also liable. 

Right to Pare to Place of Engagement 

If servants are going a distance, it should be understood 
that if they leave before the master is ready to return, they must 
pay their own fare back. If the servant remains during the 
period for which he or she is engaged, his fare is paid both ways. 

Heads of a House must indorse Management 

The heads of a household must indorse any one to whom 
they depute the management of their establishment. Too much 
stress cannot be laid upon this necessity. The responsibilities 
of the housekeeper rest heavily upon her, and the heads of the 
house should never give ear to the complaint of a disaffected or 
malicious servant. Such reports should always be sent to the 
one whom they chiefly concern. 

For the heads of the house to listen is to give credence at 
least in part, to disintegrate authority, and to take it from hands 
in which it is frankly placed. It is the beginning of disorder. 
And in housekeeping order is a first law. 

To guard Exactions of Servants, One of Another 

The exactions of servants toward one another is another 
point which should be carefully guarded against. In any group 
of persons, even if there are only three or four, there is com- 



BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SEBVANT8 7 

monly some more dominating and masterful — not to say lazy 
— character than the others. Mistress or housekeeper should 
guard carefully the more yielding and kindlier dispositions, and 
see that they are not put upon by their colleagues. Such a 
domestic as "the man of all work" is especially apt to be loaded 
with duties by other servants unless he is protected. 



CHAPTER II 

GENERALLY RECOGNIZED DUTIES 
Duties of Housekeeper 

A managing housekeeper should be possessed of thorough 
executive ability. Necessarily she is well bred and well 
educated. To her duties she often in our country brings a 
knowledge of refined housekeeping gained in her own home, a 
knowledge of life and its conventions, and the tact to direct 
those serving her which is commonly given alone to those bred 
in early years to gentle living. 

She is, under the mistress, head of the house. She hires and 
discharges all servants. She sees personally that all work is 
thoroughly and properly done. She is, with constant kindness 
in her heart for human frailty, on the watch to detect and 
correct any wrongdoing on the part of any servant. She 
should never spy, never go quietly to detect errors. Her ap- 
proach should always be known. She should gain the good 
will and affection of those she directs by unfailing good order 
and kindly interest in each of them. Let her have few 
rules, but those few most effectively kept. If she has the con- 
fidence and respect of those under her, she has their support. 
The heads of the house must fully indorse her in every detail 
of her administration. 

The housekeeper is sometimes also secretary to the mistress 
of the house. But at all times she takes entire charge of the 
house ; in fact, is what her name denotes, — a keeper of the 
house. 

She oversees the closing of the town house and the opening

HOUSEKEEPER. 



BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 9 

of the country house, she sees that all carpets are sent to be 
cleaned, that all blankets are put away in good order, that heavy 
curtains are taken down, and the furniture slip-covers put on 
early in May. She sends lace curtains to the cleaner's. She 
keeps her eyes open for any defects that might damage the 
property of the householders and reports the need of all repairs 
to the mistress. 

Her day is commonly spent in some such wise as this : 
She should be up early in the morning and see that all under her 
charge are at work by seven. She has planned their daily work 
and must see that her directions are carried out with clocklike 
regularity. Her first duty is to go through the servants' rooms 
and see that all beds and windows have been left open by the 
occupants for sweetening and 'freshening in the morning air. 
Her breakfast, which is commonly served about eight, is brought 
by the second chambermaid and is served in her own sitting 
room or office. In some large households the children of the 
family eat at the housekeeper's table, which is served by a 
footman. 

After breakfast the housekeeper goes to the pantry to see 
what is wanted in the way of supplies — such as brushes, 
sponges, towels, soap, chamois, and other articles used for clean- 
ing and washing. If glass or china has been broken, it should 
be reported to her at once. Plenty of towels are needed in the 
pantry, and those of good quality are cheaper in the end. Fine 
glass and silver require soft linen. If the towels furnished are 
too coarse, the men will be driven to use the expensive table 
napkins for their polishing. 

It is well for the housekeeper to look through all drawers and 
closets in the pantry, and also into the ice-box, to see that all 
things are kept clean and that no stale fruit or food is by 
chance left behind. If servants see that the housekeeper is 
interested in keeping all such places in order, they themselves 
are more neat and careful. 



10 MRS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

In smaller establishments the housekeeper now makes up 
her lists for the grocer and her menus for lunch and dinner. 
When these have been examined by the mistress of the house, 
she goes to market and sends in all that is necessary for the 
day's meals. She then returns home to see that what she has 
ordered has been sent. In larger establishments she first pays 
her regular visit to the kitchen, at which time the chef, or 
cook, asks for anything needed other than the marketing. In 
such establishments the menu arranged by the chef or cook 
is approved by the mistress of the house, or if not by her, then 
by the housekeeper. 

The same duty and the unswerving vigilance with which 
she began the day lead her to go through all rooms of the 
house, to be sure that her aids have done their work properly. 
She sees that the bath-rooms are in perfect order, the bath-tubs 
clean, soap-dishes and racks wiped, glasses on the basin in 
order, and all waterclosets scoured and flushed. If guests are 
expected, she helps to welcome them to the house by seeing 
that towels are in plenty, fresh soap is in the dish, fresh ink 
in the inkstand, fresh pen in the holder, and that stationery is 
at hand, and the pin-cushion well supplied with pins. Candles 
and matches on the stand by the bedside, whether in a house 
where electric lights are used or not, do not miss her over- 
sight. She sees to it also that the drawers of closet and 
bureau are empty, and that, if sachets. are not supplied, smooth 
white paper is spread in them. 

After luncheon there is often at times a little mending need- 
ful in the table linen, and this mending sometimes falls to the 
housekeeper. It should be done before sending away to the 
laundry. A linen book is well kept in the pantry. In this 
book the pantry maid should make a list of all table linen 
before it is sent to the wash. This linen, as well as all other 
soiled linen, should be taken to the laundry Friday afternoons, 
so that the laundress may sort it for washing Saturday. The

BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 11 

housekeeper checks off the linen when it comes from the laundry, 
and directs the putting away of it. A well-trained housemaid 
may assist, but the housekeeper herself should look after it 
personally. 

The housekeeper has charge of the linen closet, and sees that 
the supply is increased when necessary. It is she also in many 
houses who gives out the daily supply of linen, orders the 
flowers, and sees that they are properly arranged by the butler. 
In fact, the housekeeper often gives the butler a helping hand 
with the flowers, especially when no parlor maid is kept and 
the butler and second man have charge of the parlors. The 
housekeeper orders all coal, wood, etc., and in some houses she 
has entire charge of the wine closet, giving out daily to the 
butler the wines he requires, and handing to the mistress a 
weekly list of the contents of the wine closet. 

In the evening the housekeeper usually makes up the 
accounts and goes over the books of the different tradespeople, 
for she pays all bills and sees that in items and as a whole they 
are correct. 

Duties of Lady's Maid 

A lady's maid should be a well-mannered, respectable-look- 
ing young woman. She should be a tolerably good dressmaker 
and a good hairdresser. 

Her first morning duty is to dress her mistress. About this 
it is impossible to give directions, since ladies differ much in 
their toilet arrangements. The housemaid generally takes up 
the hot water for the mistress. Occasionally the mistress pre- 
fers to have her own maid do so. 

The maid draws her mistress's bath, and after the latter has 
bathed and is dressed, the maid must examine her wardrobe, 
put away everything left about the room, and shake or iron 
out tumbled dresses. She then sits in the sewing room, but 
must be in readiness to answer her mistress's bell, and to dress 



12 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

her for a walk, drive, or ride, having everything ready and 
boots, gloves, etc., in perfect order. 

During the day, when not in actual attendance, she will 
have to mend and probably to wash and iron fine lace, hand- 
kerchiefs, etc. Very little instruction can be given on this 
point. Different mistresses have different needs and make 
different demands upon maids. Brushes should be washed in 
tepid water to which a little ammonia is added, care being 
taken not to wet the back of the brush. The bristles should 
be rinsed thoroughly and dried, if possible, in the open air. 

Once a week the lady's maid will have to send her mistress's 
linen to the wash. She should look over the clothes and mend 
everything that requires a stitch before sending it, making also 
two lists, one in a book for the laundress and one in a book to 
be kept at home. When the clothes return from the wash, the 
maid should compare them with the list, examine the marks to 
see that they have not been changed, sew on any buttons, and 
set aside any badly washed or ironed garments. 

For the dinner toilet she should have everything prepared 
and at hand. As soon as the toilet is made and her mistress 
has left the room, she should examine the dress just removed, 
brush it if it is a tweed, shake and wipe it if it is a silk or any 
light material. Silk dresses should be wiped with a soft piece 
of merino or very fine flannel. If anything needs mending, it 
should be done at once. Everything should be aired, cleaned, 
and put away — either folded or hung in the wardrobe. 

The mistress's bedroom must be ready for her at the usual 
hour of her retiring for the night. It is the maid's duty to 
undress her mistress, and remain in attendance until she is 
dismissed. 

A respectful manner is necessary in a lady's maid. She is 
not to keep her seat while her mistress is speaking to her, unless 
she is asked to, and she is to rise when her mistress enters the 
room.

BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 13 

A good deal of sitting up at night is sometimes required 
from a lady's maid. She must strive to get what rest she 
can, and good-temperedly support any inevitable fatigue. A 
cheerful, kindly performance of her duties, and deference, obe- 
dience, industry, and strict honesty will be apt to secure for her 
a friend in her mistress and a happy home under all ordinary 
circumstances. 

A sewing room should be set aside for the use of the lady's 
maid. 

Duties of Valet 

The valet's duty is to wait upon his master. In the morn- 
ing he attends to the lighting of the fire and warming of his 
master's bedroom. He then cleans his boots and shoes, and 
brushes his clothing, which he arranges on a table or chair. 
He prepares the master's bath, and if it is wished, hands gar- 
ments to him as he dresses. He is sometimes expected to 
shave his master. Later he puts the dressing room in order, 
brushes clothes before putting them away, cleans combs and 
brushes, and is at his master's orders whenever required. 

Valeting is often done by the butler and footmen or second 
men. The latter take turns in valeting guests. 

There should be a room set aside for the valet in which to 
press, brush, and care for his master's clothes. If a specific 
room for this use is impossible, he must do the best he can in 
the laundry or the front basement. 

Duties of Butler 

The butler has entire charge of the dining room and of the 
under menservants or footmen. Both he and his men should 
be at work by seven in the morning. The butler puts the din- 
ing room in order, sets the table, and then has his own break- 
fast at seven-thirty in the servants' hall. When three or more 
men are kept, he serves his master's breakfast and takes his 
orders for the day. He sees to setting of trays for any break- 



14 MBS. seely's cook book 

fasts going to bedrooms. He alone waits at breakfast unless 
guests are in the house, when he is assisted by the second man. 

After breakfast he sees that all china and glass are carefully- 
washed and put away, and then cleans the smaller pieces of sil- 
ver in daily use. He prepares salads required at luncheon — a 
meal in many houses almost as elaborate as a dinner. In some 
families the butler and footman are on duty alternate after- 
noons—attending the bell, seeing to the parlor fires, lighting 
gas and lamps, serving afternoon tea, which is in special charge 
of the butler, and setting the dinner table. 

The butler always takes charge of all wines, and has them 
properly cooled or warmed, as the need may be. He announces 
all meals and does all carving. He serves dinner, assisted by 
the footman. He serves the principal dishes at the table, and 
is followed by his assistant, who serves the sauces, vegetables, 
etc. After dinner he carries coffee to the parlor or library, as 
the custom of the house where he is may be. The silver, wines, 
flowers, and fruits are commonly in his charge. He puts away 
the silver in the safe, closes for the night all rooms under his 
care, and takes alternate evenings with the footman at sitting 
up awaiting the return of any members of the family who have 
been at the theatre, etc., and may require refreshments on their 
return. 

The butler is always to open the safe and not to allow the 
combination to be known by the men. The housekeeper 
should know the combination, in case of his sickness ; the 
heads of the house also. The butler is to keep the wine closet 
locked, and he checks off upon his list of wines whatever he 
takes out. The wine, cigars, etc., of the house are usually 
bought by the master. 

The butler, as we have said, looks after the footmen. He 
sees that they are prompt at their work, respectful in their 
behavior, and neat in their persons as well as in their work. 
If in these ways he is not competent, the housekeeper is obliged

to call his attention to his work and himself. In houses where 
no housekeeper is employed he has the table linen in his care, 
takes out daily what he requires, and counts it before sending 
to the laundry. 

A butler wears at breakfast, and also at luncheon, a high 
double-breasted black waistcoat (not a low-cut evening one), 
trousers of any mixed pepper-and-salt description, never black, 
a black tie, and a black dress coat. In the evening he wears all 
black, with a low cut waistcoat that may be white if he chooses, 
and a white tie. At dinner he always stands behind his mas- 
ter's chair, and the footman behind his mistress. 

Valeting, especially of guests, is sometimes done by the but- 
ler. He valets the master if required. 

A single-handed butler takes charge of dining room and sil- 
ver, and valets the gentlemen of the house. He also helps more 
or less with the cleaning of the parlor floor. The parlor maid 
assists him at night with the washing of the dinner dishes, and 
also answers the bell while he is cleaning the silver. 

Duties of First Footman 

The first footman lays the table for each meal, serves the 
family breakfast either on trays in the different rooms or in 
the breakfast or dining room, and attends the door during the 
morning. In households where but a butler and one footman are 
kept, the two alternate in tending the door. In other establish- 
ments the first, second, and third footmen take turns at the door, 
each one serving every third day. Families differ in the manage- 
ment of these divisions of household labor, but the above and 
all other duties mentioned apply in a general rule. 

If the first footman does not wait at breakfast, he is busy 
cleaning silver. To keep it in perfect order, silver should be 
rubbed every day and cleaned once a week, and he will therefore 
need to do some part every day. The large dining room, where 
there is a breakfast room also, he has to brush before he sets out 



16 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

the silver on the sideboard. The dining room is thoroughly- 
swept every Saturday morning, and of course is in perfect order 
before the family breakfast. If it is used upon the previous day, 
it should be brushed every morning. All sweeping and dusting 
should be finished before breakfast. 

The morning dress of the footman is of a double-breasted 
coat, waistcoat, trousers, and small black tie. At lunch he wears 
his regular livery suit with a striped waistcoat. When the 
family is in mourning, he wears black tie, studs, and cuff -buttons. 
At dinner he wears livery. His livery should always be 
immaculate. 

Each second man or footman should have every second or 
third afternoon from the time lunch work is finished until five 
o'clock. 

Duties of Second and Third Footman 

The second footman has care of the breakfast room, waits at 
breakfast with the butler, helps with trays, leathers the small 
silver, and helps wipe dishes. 

The third footman has care of the front hall and library; 
also of coat-room. He dusts every morning and sweeps the 
halls thoroughly Saturday mornings and the library on Thurs- 
days. He serves breakfast to the housekeeper and children's 
table if there be one, and with his fellow-footmen takes turns at 
serving lunch at this table. He is dressed in livery at ten 
o'clock and in the hall to answer bells, etc. 

Valeting is done by footmen. They take turns in valeting 
guests. 

The Duties of Second Man when Three Men (a Butler and 
Useful Man) are kept 

To be at work at 7 a.m. ; sweep and dust the front hall and 
vestibule and to breakfast at seven-thirty. To carry up all 
trays with breakfasts to those having breakfast in their rooms.

pantry, cleans silver and takes charge of the cooling and warm-

maid at answering front door-bell and seeing that all windows 
and doors on the parlor floor are fastened for the night. She

BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 19 

When two or more men are kept, her work varies. She has 
the drawing, reception and sitting rooms, main stairs and lava- 
tories on the parlor floor to dust every morning. When the 
drawing room and sitting rooms are thoroughly swept the sec- 
ond footman or useful man should help, because the furniture is 
too heavy for a woman to lift. If they begin the work at six in 
the morning, their assisting does not interfere with the pantry 
work. 

The parlor maid washes dishes and keeps clean the drawers, 
closets, and refrigerators of the pantry. The cleaning of brass 
in the pantry is done by one of the pantry men. She should 
see that towels are in abundance and are washed every day. 
She sweeps and puts the pantry in order every day, and washes 
it up once or twice a week. 

Her dress is the same as that of the chambermaid. 

Duties of Chambermaid 

She should commence sweeping halls at six-thirty. After 
breakfast she dusts halls, draws baths, calls the family or visi- 
tors, and opens up shutters in bedrooms. She also assists the 
lady's maid in brushing the dresses. 

After the family have gone to breakfast, she opens their bed- 
room windows, takes clothes off the beds, one by one, placing 
them across two chairs to air, and turns the mattress across the 
foot of the bed to air. She then puts away any clothing, dress- 
ing-gowns, slippers, etc., washes out soap-dishes and other toilet 
articles, going through each bedroom in her care, and opening 
up each bed to air in each room. She then commences to make, 
at the first she opened for refreshing. Every day she should 
sweep up pieces and thoroughly dust not only the furniture but 
woodwork of the room. Once a week every room should be 
thoroughly swept, and plumbing fixtures and silver toilet arti- 
cles cleaned. One room a day should be done in this manner, 
the useful man cleaning the windows and brasses, and, on a lad- 



20 MBS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

der, wiping over tops of doors, pictures, etc. All work should 
be finished in the bedrooms before lunch. If there is not time 
to accomplish all before lunch, then she cleans the silver articles 
after, and brings them back to their places. 

One chambermaid is expected to assist in the pantry the 
nights of dinner parties, and, where two chambermaids are kept, 
they take evenings about. When dusk comes, the chambermaid 
draws down the shades and lights the gas. Where there are 
open fireplaces, she builds up a bright fire. If guests are stay- 
ing in the house, she sees that they have everything they re- 
quire. After the family and guests go to dinner she removes 
and carefully folds the lace spreads, etc., of the beds. She then 
turns the bed down' nicely and lays the nightgown on it. 
Dressing-gowns and slippers are placed on or by chairs. She 
removes soiled towels and puts out fresh ones, tidies wash- 
stand, lowers gas, and sees that drinking water is put in all bed- 
rooms not later than nine o'clock in winter ; ten will do in sum- 
mer. If gentlemen are staying in the house, and have no valet 
with them, the chambermaid in charge of their rooms either 
herself (or sees that the useful man) puts out the evening suit, 
a clean shirt with studs, etc., and, after the guest has gone to 
dinner, that the suit of clothes and boots he has worn through 
the day are taken away, cleaned and brought back ready for the 
next morning. 

One of the first things for a chambermaid to learn is how 
properly to make a bed. Every bed which has been occupied 
should, to preserve the health of its occupant and the hygiene 
of the house, be thoroughly aired both in bed-clothes and mat- 
tress every time it is used. The first chambermaid has charge 
of all bedrooms and bath-rooms on the second floor and one 
stairway. She also assists in the linen room. 

All beds are changed on Saturday so that the soiled clothes 
can go to the laundry that morning. 
The chambermaid's dress for morning wear should always

be of light print material, waist and skirt to match. In the 
afternoon she wears waist and skirt of black cashmere or 
serge, white collar and cuffs. She wears cap and apron at 
all times. 

Duties of Second Chambermaid 

The second chambermaid has charge of the bedrooms on the 
third floor and third hall and stairs. These should be taken 
care of with as scrupulous cleanliness and care as any other. If 
on this floor there is a playroom, it should be cleaned and put in 
order before the hall, early in the morning. The chambermaid 
gives this room its first daily cleaning. The nurses keep it in 
order for the day. 

Duties of Third Chambermaid 

The third chambermaid brushes and dusts the sewing room 
early every morning in order not to disturb the ladies' maids 
when they are busy. She has charge of servants' bed- and 
bath-rooms, hall and stairs. Sometimes nurses make their 
own beds ; but the chambermaid does their cleaning in their 
rooms. 

She makes the beds of the men, cooks, kitchen maids and 
laundresses, etc., and sweeps, dusts, and tidies their rooms — 
keeping them in perfect order. 

She keeps the servants' hall in order and cleans silver for its 
table. In fact she takes care of this dining hall, except its 
windows. 

Duties of Laundress 

The laundress should collect all the linen requiring washing 
and compare it with the list given her and then assort it. Linen 
should be washed well in two waters. The first water should 
be cool. The second should be hot and plentiful. Scald, rinse 
in hot water, then in cold water slightly tinged with blue, 



22 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

wring thoroughly, and hang in the sunshine and air to bleach 
and dry. After the articles are ironed and thoroughly aired the 
laundress should fold them neatly and pass them on to the 
housemaid or lady's maid to assort. Handkerchiefs should be 
ironed wet, to stiffen and give them a gloss. 

When the housekeeper pays her regular visit to the laundry, 
the laundress should then tell what she needs to further her 
work. 

Duties of Second Laundress 

She is to rise not later than six-thirty, make the laundry fire 
and put the laundry in order. She washes and irons all the 
plain clothes, and sometimes where the fine wash is very large 
she assists the head laundress in ironing. 

Duties of Cook 

She should be in the kitchen early — by six o'clock — and 
prepare for the servants' breakfast at seven. After breakfast 
she should prepare and send up the family breakfast. Later 
she should tell the housekeeper what is wanted for the day, pre- 
pare pies, puddings, or ices for luncheon and dinner, see that the 
kitchen maid has vegetables and that the meat and pudding are 
attended to for the servants' dinner at twelve-thirty. After 
this dinner she prepares and sends up the family lunch. After 
lunch she sees that all vegetables, game, etc., required for the 
family dinner, are prepared, and makes cake or anything required 
for afternoon tea.A She should always have a list of what is re- 
quired from the grocer, etc., ready for the housekeeper, should 
see that the kitchen maid does her work well and is clean, that 
the refrigerator, meat house, etc., are in good order. In fact, 
she takes entire charge of the kitchen under the housekeeper, 
and she should personally supervise the cleaning of the kitchen 
and cooking utensils, ice-boxes, etc. 

The cook, if cooking only is expected and a kitchen maid is 



RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 23 

kept, is supposed to take entire charge of the family cooking. 
She prepares and cooks all game such as canvasback and redhead 
duck, etc., and all entrees. 

If she is privileged to go out alternate Sundays, she should 
have everything prepared and ready for the kitchen maid to 
cook. 

In smaller establishments the cook is expected to clean the 
hall and passage, as well as the kitchen,, scullery, etc. When the 
morning's dirty work is done, she should carefully wash her 
hands and visit the larder. Here she should look to everything. 
See if the hanging meat or game requires cooking. Wipe out 
and air the bread-box. Clean and scrub the larder at least 
twice a week. Receive her mistress's orders attentively, and if 
she cannot trust her memory, write them on a slate. She should 
examine the meat sent by the butcher, and if it is not right, re- 
fuse to accept it. She should also weigh the meat and ask the 
butcher for a paper of weight. 

And now a few hints to the cook about kitchen work : — 

Clean up as you go. 

Don't scatter in the kitchen. 

Be sure to put scalding water in each saucepan or stewpan 
as you finish using it. 

Keep your spice-box always replenished, and take care to 
let your mistress know if you are out of anything likely to be 
required, that its place may at once be supplied. 

Take care of your copper utensils that the tin does not be- 
come worn off. If so, have them instantly replaced. 

Dry your saucepans before you put them away. 

Pudding bags and jelly cloths require care ; wash and hang 
them to dry directly after using them. Air them well before 
you put them away or they will smell musty. Keep them in a 
warm, dry place. 

After washing up your dishes and cleaning the dishpan, 
scald out the sink and sink brush. 



24 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Be careful not to throw anything but water down the sink, 
lest you should clog it up. 

Never have sticky, greasy plates and dishes. The way to 
avoid this is to use soap, very hot water, and clean dry towels. 
Change the water often. Perfectly clean plates and dishes are 
one proof of the cook being a good servant. 

Be particular in washing vegetables. Lay cauliflower and 
cabbage in salt and water for an hour or more to get out the 
insects, etc. 

If a dinner party is in prospect, ask for the bill of fare and 
get ready all you can the day before, to ease worry and hurry on 
the day fixed. 

Take notice of all orders that require time in the preparation 
of a dinner and hurry nothing. 

Wear plain cotton dresses and large aprons. 

Be sure to keep your hair neat and smooth. 

Be careful of fuel. It is a great recommendation to a cook 
to use only the necessary amount of coal. 

Have an eye to your mistress's interests, not permitting 
waste of any kind. A cook who is just and honest and does as 
she would be done by is worthy of the greatest respect and may 
be sure of being successful and happy. 

Duties of Chef 

A chef has the entire charge of his kitchen, and, as a rule, 
two assistants, who are called second cook and kitchen maid. 
The chef does all ordering for the kitchen in the way of mar- 
keting. Utensils, etc., are ordered by the housekeeper. He 
makes up the menu, and cooks for the family table, and. 
arranges all the meals for the servants' table. 

Duties of Second Cook 

The second cook helps the chef with all cooking for the 
family, and is expected to cook for the servants' table. In

washes dishes, and then helps the cook in sending up the 
family breakfast ; she prepares vegetables for the servants' 
dinner, sets the table, and serves the servants' dinner at twelve 
o'clock, waiting upon the table. After dinner she washes the

lishment 

An establishment or stable department where all kinds of 
carriages are kept, from a coach to a runabout, differs according

stands his business in every detail, and one who commands the 
respect of men under him. 

He should have full and complete charge of everything con- 
nected with the stable, be held responsible for its service in every 
way, and have authority to discharge his men for misconduct. 

His duties require him to see the horses fed, and his men at 
work in the morning punctually at the hour set by him. He 
should see that the men do their work properly, he should say 
what horses require exercise, etc., and strictly watch the gen- 
eral health and comfort of the animals. 

To the head coachman falls especially attention to the first 
lady of the household. He sees that all his men are properly 
fitted with the livery required for each style of carriage, and 
that they are at all times clean and neat in person. 

To regulate his work he will need a second coachman, who 
will drive in his turn, see that all carriages are kept perfectly 
clean, pay strict attention to the oiling of wheels, etc., and 
care for general neatness of the coach house. 

A third coachman, or pad groom, will be required to ride

It will need the time of the other men to clean and harness 
horses, and properly attend to them after they are used; to 
clean stable drains and stable ; to keep the place free from 
foul odor ; and to dust, wash windows, etc. 

In order to insure the convenience of the family, and to

Cook and laundress, chambermaid and waitress, if only two 
servants are kept, should work together, taking each other's 
place alternate on days or nights out. Their duties are stated 
in foregoing pages. If there are three maids and the third be 
a laundress, she should take the cleaning the last of the week

off. In many cases she has every second Sunday, and one 
evening in the week, and occasionally two or three hours of 
an afternoon for shopping. In some cases the mistress washes 
the dishes and makes the beds, especially on washing and iron- 
ing days, and on her Sunday afternoon and evening off. But 
no two households are alike. Rules differ very much. 



32 



CHAPTER V 

DON'TS FOR EMPLOYER 

Don't engage a servant without having a clear understand- 
ing as to what he or she is expected to do. 

Don't give an order and then forget it, and contradict your- 
self. 

Don't send orders to one servant through another if you 
can avoid it. 

Don't discuss servants in general, or those of any particular 
nationality, while you are being waited on at table. 

Don't. promise a holiday, or any pleasure, and then take it 
back. 

Don't spy upon your servants — take pains to be sure they 
are honest, and then trust them rationally. 

Don't expose them to temptation by leaving money care- 
lessly about, as if it had no value for you. 

Don't go into your servants' rooms, unless you have reason to 
think they are not clean, — they have a right to some privacy .< 

Don't blame servants for every fault or mistake, and then 
leave good service unthanked. They would rather, being 
human, be scolded and praised than have uniform excellence 
taken for granted. 

Don't expect in your servants a perfection which would be 
impossible in any human being. 

Don't talk of one servant in the hearing of another. Don't 
discuss one servant with another. 

Don't rely on information given you by one servant of the 
other without first investigating. Often ill-feeling and jealousy 
will prompt a false report. 

d 33 



34 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Don't allow the cook to stint the table of the servants. 
They should be well fed. It pays to drop into the kitchen at 
meal time and see if their meals are properly cooked and served. 

Don't fail to see that their beds are good and their rooms 
properly cared for. Give each one a separate room when it is 
possible. 

Don't expect servants to perform duties without proper 
utensils to work with. Have dust sheets, cloths, brooms, 
brushes, pails, chamois, dusters, etc., and require each servant 
to look after his or her own articles. 

Don't neglect to have inventory of china, glass, silver, and 
bric-a-brac of each servant coming and going. Without this 
it is difficult to keep track of various articles. 

Don't forget the old proverb, which has generations of 
human experience in it : " Like mistress like maid ; like mas- 
ter like man." 

See that each person in your employ, especially when kept 
busy late in the evening, has a time in the day, say of an hour 
or two, when he or she may be alone and rest, or do what he or 
she wishes. 

In arranging a changing off of work, for instance, the 
change about of parlor maid with waitress, when one takes 
some hours off, see that each one clearly understands her duties 
and privileges. This will save misunderstanding, and perhaps 
a complete upsetting of the domestic order. 

The best way to get polite and respectful service is to be 
respectful and polite and self-contained yourself. 



CHAPTER VI 

DON'TS FOR SERVANTS 

Don't decide the minute you enter a new situation that it 
doesn't suit you. Pay no attention to any gossip that may be 
told you. Wait and see for yourself. By so doing you will 
avoid unnecessary trouble for self as well as your employer. 

Don't tell an untruth about your wages. Tell what amount 
you have received a month when asked by an employer. False- 
hood will place you in a very bad position. It is sure to be 
found out. 

Don't be foolish in regard to wearing a cap. It is a great 
improvement to one's appearance, and is worn by all first-class 
servants. Be sure to keep the hair tidy. 

Don't listen while you are waiting at table — you will prob- 
ably get things twisted and be tempted to repeat them so. 

Don't be always standing on your dignity as to what is and 
is not " your place " — if you cannot get along go away, but 
while you are in a house be pleasant. 

Don't hide breakage from your mistress, — it will get you 
into more trouble in the end than if you acknowledge the acci- 
dent at once. 

Don't think your mistress is unbearable because she may 
sometimes be a little short in her manner, — ladies often have 
worries and responsibilities of which servants have no idea. 

Don't spend your time comparing the ways of one mistress 
with those of another — each one has a right to her own rules 
in her own house. 

Don't spy on your masters and mistresses — the fact that their 
bread is in your mouth should be a reason for keeping it shut.

36 MRS. SMELY'S COOK BOOK 

Don't go through your work mechanically — try to notice 
how people leave things themselves, and put them in that order. 

Don't " arrange " the papers on a desk or writing table 
unless expressly told to ; pick them up, dust them, and where 
they have lain, and put them down in the same place. 

Don't be restless and want to move too often — the longer 
you stay in one place the more likely you are to get a good 
wedding present or legacy. 

Don't, when September comes, be influenced by city friends 
and give up a good home on account of your employer's remain- 
ing in the country until October or November. Girls often do 
this, and it is a great mistake. They are apt to remain idle 
two or three weeks, and then are often compelled again to go 
out of town and amongst strangers. 

Don't leave garbage in the pantry from one meal to another. 
Always keep the sink and pantry clean. 

Don't upset the cook by telling her what the family say 
about her cooking. Leave that for the mistress. If there is 
any fault to be found it is not so apt to cause trouble if it goes 
direct to the cook from her mistress. 

Don't forget when meats, turkey, and game are served, that 
sauce or gravy, also the jelly, such as cranberry jelly, etc., 
should be served before the vegetables. 

Don't, when you are cleaning rooms, forget your dusters, 
broom, and other articles. Look around before you leave the 
room and take them with you. It is not pleasant to trip over 
such things. 

Don't forget to clean the finger marks from paint when you 
are cleaning rooms. 

Don't forget to clean the bed-springs; they should be 
cleaned twice a month. Bedroom closets should also be 
cleaned twice a month. 



CHAPTER VII 

THE SERVANTS' HALL 

In large households there is a hall, or dining room, for the 
servants. This room should be so arranged that it can be used 
for a general sitting room in the evening. It is taken care of 
by the kitchen maid. In some houses the servants have also 
the use of the front basement as a sitting room. Again in many- 
places they are expected to eat in the kitchen and to use a part 
of it for a sitting room. 

Very few of the old downtown houses have the advantage 
of wholesome and sufficient servants' quarters, but in the newer 
dwellings the architects and owners seem to recognize the fact 
that the little company, which is to keep the great house clean 
and sanitary, cannot be clean or well in its different members 
without sufficient room and appliances for keeping clean. 

The general government of the servants' hall rests with the 
butler and the cook. 

Each servant has a right to some time off duty, and to some 
time out of the house. The common rule in regard to return 
in the evening is that each should be in by half-past ten, and 
doors locked before eleven. Any one wishing to remain out 
later should obtain permission, the butler reporting the men 
and the women applying to the housekeeper. 

In smaller households in the question of time off duty, the 
cook has every other Sunday afternoon and evening, one even- 
ing in the week after dinner is served, and occasionally an 
afternoon, say from three to ten-thirty. If no kitchen maid is 
kept, the cook prepares the dinner and the laundress cooks it. 

The waitress has the same time off, the chambermaid taking 

37 



38 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

her place, if no parlor maid is kept. The chambermaid has the 
same privilege, the waitress turning down beds, taking water 
to the rooms, and making other arrangements for the night. 
Two or three servants must be at home to answer family calls 
and door-bells, the mistress arranging this matter so that there 
may be no misunderstanding. 

The butler has every other afternoon off, footman alternat- 
ing, returning at five o'clock. If the butler is single-handed, 
he has one or two nights a week and a few hours of an afternoon. 
Where a number of servants are kept, they have more time off 
and arrange this among themselves. 

Servants should be downstairs not later than six -thirty in 
the morning, and when they have work especially demanding 
an early hour, even earlier. Work which takes the maid or 
man in the presence or sight of the family or its guests should 
be well over in the early part of the day. There are two reasons 
for this : one is that the work may be an annoyance and inter- 
ruption to the family ; another is that workers cannot do so 
well when they feel that they are intruding. In well-organized 
households servants are not in evidence after lunch except in 
direct personal service. 

In the servants' hall breakfast is commonly served at seven 
o'clock or half -past seven, dinner at twelve or half -past twelve, 
and supper about half -past five. These hours vary, however, 
and are subject to the conditions of individual households. 
They should be so arranged that all may be prompt at the table, 
and that the duties which bring them to the household and keep 
them there, may not be interfered with. 

In regard to their rooms, as a rule they have the top floor, 
some of the men rooming out. 

The Store-room 

Groceries and supplies for a household of any size should, if 
possible, be bought in quantity, and, therefore, every house 



THE SERVANTS' HALL 39 

should have a store-room. In this room an account book should 
be kept, and in it should be entered the date when each store 
is bought and the price paid for it. 

The store-room should be absolutely dry and furnished with 
shelves, nails, and drawers. A suspended net or two should 
also be supplied for hanging lemons, oranges, etc. Earthenware 
jars are necessary for sugar, oatmeal, rice, tapioca, sago, barley, 
spices, etc., and if it is wished to keep on hand the pound 
cake and fruit cake of our grandmothers (and cakes made 
from old-fashioned receipts given in this book will keep for 
years), no place for their preservation is so good as a dry 
store-room and earthen jars with tight-fitting covers for their 
snugger quarters. 

Onions, shallots, and garlic should not be put in the store- 
room, nor in the ice box, but hung from the ceiling in some 
cleanly, odorless room. V Onions absorb germs, and care should 
be taken to keep them under 'most perfect sanitary conditions. 
Vegetables will keep best in a dry dark place out of the air. 

The housekeeper, if one be kept, otherwise the mistress, or 
the cook, keeps the key to the store-room. The cleaning of the 
room is done by the kitchen maid or cook, and supplies are put 
in by the useful man. 



CHAPTER VIII 
HOUSEHOLD KECEIPTS 
To clean White Paint 

To clean white paint, take a small quantity of whitening on 
a damp piece of old white flannel and rub over the surface 
lightly. It will leave the paint remarkably bright and new. 

Mahogany and General Furniture Polish 
A mahogany polish that is highly recommended is prepared 
by mixing well together one quarter of a pint each of turpen- 
tine, linseed oil, alcohol, and vinegar. Put in a bottle and shake 
before using. The furniture should be cleaned first with a soft 
flannel and a little of the mixture applied at a time. When well 
rubbed in, polish with an old silk handkerchief. 

Floor Polish 
One quart of turpentine, five cents' worth of ammonia, and not 
quite half a pound of beeswax. Chip the beeswax up fine and 
put it on the stove to melt. When melted, pour it in the tur- 
pentine and add the ammonia. Then set it in a tin pail of hot 
water on the back of the stove to heat ; and leave it in the water 
while using it, for it goes on better when warm. Rub it on with 
a flannel cloth; and for polishing, the best thing is a piece of 
Brussels carpet, for it is rough and does not require so much 
strength as a smooth cloth. 

<\ To make Window Glass Opaque 
Dissolve a tablespoonful of Epsom salts in a glass of beer or 
ale. The combination is best effected by heating. Wipe the 

40 



HOUSEHOLD RECEIPTS 41 

mixture over the window you wish to cover with crystals. It is 
impossible to see through the lace work. Greater opaqueness 
is gained by increasing the quantity of salts. 

To clean Marble 

Take two parts of common soda, one part of pumice stone and 
one part of finely powdered salt. Sift the mixture through a 
fine sieve and mix it with water, then rub it well all over the 
marble and the stains will be removed. Rub the marble over 
with salt and water, wash off, and wipe dry. 

To clean Tinware 

The best thing for cleaning tinware is common soda. 
Dampen a cloth, dip it in soda, rub the ware briskly, wash and 
wipe dry. 

To clean Cut Glass 

Having washed cut glass articles, let then dry and afterward 
rub them with prepared chalk, with a soft brush, carefully going 
into all the cavities. 

How to clean a Tea or Coffee Pot 

J If the inside of either is black from long use, fill with water 
and use a good-sized lump of washing soda and let it boil for an 
hour. Scald well after and it will be clean and bright. 

To clean Benares Brass 
Wash, and rub with half a lemon. 

How to Clean Coppers 

Take a handful of common salt, enough vinegar and flour to 
make a paste ; mix together thoroughly. There is nothing 
better for cleaning coppers. After using the paste, wash thor- 
oughly with hot water, rinse in cold water, and wipe dry. 



42 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

To put away Silver 

In putting silver away, be careful to get the silver tissue 
paper which can be bought very reasonably at Tiffany's. Silver 
is not so likely to tarnish when this paper is used. After 
wrapping in tissue paper, use brown wrapping paper outside, 
never using newspapers, as the printers' ink has a very bad effect. 

Bric-a-brac Mending 

The skill of bric-a-brac menders is not fully appreciated un- 
til it has been tried. Often the article is beyond restoration to 
its original form or use, but is capable in their clever hands of 
transformation into some other almost equally ornamental or 
serviceable thing. A woman whose cut glass carafe lost its neck 
through an accident, had it converted into a beautiful rose bowl 
at a trifling expense. In this case the bric-a-brac mender was 
also a glass cutter, but it is not difficult to find this combination 
or to seek the cut-glass worker in his special shop. 

To mend Broken China 

Powder a small quantity of lime and take the white of one 
egg and mix together to a paste. Apply quickly to the china 
to be mended, place the pieces firmly together, and they will soon 
become set and strong, seldom breaking in the same place again. 

Cleaning Fluid 

This fluid cleans cloth, felt, silk and woollen goods, and re- 
stores the color. 

Eight ounces of benzine, quarter of an ounce of chloroform, 
quarter of an ounce of sulphuric ether, eighth of an ounce of 
oil of wintergreen. 

Shake well before using and keep away from all heat and fire. 
Apply with a cloth suited to the fabric. 



HOUSEHOLD RECEIPTS 43 

The Best Way to wash and store Flannels 

Getting ready to leave town or getting ready for warm 
weather in town means the same thing in many respects. 

Flannels and flannel blankets must be washed and put away. 
The great point in washing blankets is to do the work so that 
they will preserve their softness and that the colored stripes 
may not lose their brightness. Soap should not be used in 
washing blankets ; instead, put either aqua ammonia or borax 
into the water. On delicate flannels avoid using plain soap. 
The best plan is to make soap jelly for the purpose in this 
way: — 

Shred finely as much soap as you think will be needed for 
the washing ; put it into a saucepan which should be kept for the 
purpose with just enough water, hot or cold, to cover it. Let it 
melt as slowly as possible until quite clear and free from lumps. 
Unless it is melted slowly it will boil, and boiling wastes it ; 
moreover, if boiled fast, or if the pan is too full of soap in the 
first place, it will boil over very quickly. If preferred, the soap 
may be set in a jar and melted in the oven. Any odds and ends 
of good soap may be used up in this way. It should be made 
fresh. 

To wash the flannels, have a tub half full of warm,, not hot, 
water, and stir into it enough soap jelly to produce a good 
lather. If the water is hard, or the flannels are greasy, add a 
little ammonia to the water, a tablespoonful for every two gal- 
lons of water. If you are using ammonia soap, this last is natu- 
rally not wanted. Never rub flannels if it is possible to avoid 
it, as it is pretty sure to shrink them. But squeeze them in 
your hands, working them up and down in the soapsuds. 
Then turn them inside out and wash in a second lot of soap- 
suds rather weaker than the first, and rinse them at once in 
plenty of water, repeating this rinsing until the flannels feel 
quite soft and no soap is left in them. If soap is left in, the 



44 MBS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

material becomes hard and sticky and has a disagreeable odor 
when dried. Use warm water to rinse in, for either hot or 
quite cold rinsing water shrinks and hardens flannels. When 
thoroughly rinsed, wring them carefully as dry as possible, 
using the wringing machine as it will not twist the stuff ; then 
shake them out, pull into shape, and dry at once in the open air 
if possible, in a good wind and out of the sun. 

They must not be dried in so hot a place as to make them 
steam, as it is as bad for them as using boiling water. Shake 
the flannels and turn them now and again while drying, pulling 
them gently into shape. Iron when nearly dry with a cool 
iron. Flannels shrink from the soap being rubbed on to them 
instead of using soap jelly; from being washed or rinsed in 
over hot or cold water ; from being left lying about wet instead 
l of drying them at once ; from being dried too slowly or in too 
;hot an atmosphere, and from being ironed while wet with too 
hot an iron. New and sanitary flannels may be soaked for half 
an hour or so in warm water with a little ammonia as before ; 
cover the tub to keep in the heat and squeeze and wring them 
out of this before the water gets cold. 

Rice Water for washing Challies 

Rice water is about the best thing to use in washing chal- 
lies. Boil one pound of rice in five quarts of water. When 
somewhat cool, put the challies in with rice and the rice water 
and wash well, using the rice much as you would soap. If no 
rinsing is used, the rice will have a good effect upon the fabric. 

To make Starch 

With cold water thoroughly dissolve the starch. Then 
pour on boiling water, stirring constantly. When made, stir it 
round two or three times with a wax candle. By doing this 
you keep the starch from sticking to the iron. 



HOUSEHOLD RECEIPTS 45 

To remove Iron Rust 

Mix salt with a little lemon juice; put in the sun. If 
necessary, use two applications. 

To take Mildew from Linen 

Rub the spots with soap, scrape chalk over them, rub them 
well, lay the linen on the grass in the sun and, as it dries, wet 
it a little. The spots should come out in two applications. 

To take out Mildew 
Dip the stained cloth in buttermilk and lay in the sun. 

To cleanse a Chamois Skin 

Wash it in cold water with plenty of soap, rinse well in 
clear cold water. You may wash a skin in this way as often 
as you please and still keep it soft. 

To press Ribbons 

In pressing slightly rumpled ribbons with a hot iron, lay 
them between two sheets of manilla paper and they will come 
out new.

DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 



Dinner 

invitations. 



Silent ser- 
vice. 

Shape of 
table. 



The two things most essential to a successful dinner in these 
days are, — well-chosen company and good service. If to these 
you can add artistic cooking and beautiful table ornaments, so 
much the better, but the best food loses half its savor if we are 
bored while eating it, and the best talk is apt to flag if there 
are long pauses between the courses. 

The hostess should send out her invitations at least two or 
three weeks beforehand. (These invitations should be answered 
at once, certainly within twenty-four hours. No obligation is 
more exacting than a dinner engagement, and nothing but ill- 
ness should ever permit one to break it.) 

To assure the success of her dinner she should be certain 
that her guests are agreeable to one another, and when seating 
them at her table arrange so that the talkative ones may be 
next to the more silent ones. She should consider the capa- 
bilities of her cook and not attempt dishes beyond his skill and 
knowledge. Her dining-room servants should be so trained 
that they serve the dinner in silence, not even the sound of a 
footfall should be heard. 

To begin with the table : the prettiest to look at are those 
which are five feet square, where two people sit on each side, 
but they are by no means the best for social purposes. The 

46 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 47 

corners stick out and interfere somewhat with the service, and, 
what is more serious, the talk does not seem to pass them easily. 
At dinners of more than ten or twelve, conversation must neces- 
sarily, most of the time, be a series of duets, and all a hostess 
can do is to assort her pairs carefully beforehand. But one of 
the chief charms of a small party is that the talk may be general, 
and experience has shown that it is not nearly so likely to flow 
smoothly back and forth if there is a little angle jutting out 
between two of the guests. And then, if there should be only Arrange- 
six people, two of them sit on one side, two on the other, and ment of 

EUCStS 

the host and hostess at the ends alone, with an empty space on 
either side of them, which has a somewhat chilling influence. 
The old-fashioned round table, which may be made as long as 
one chooses by the insertion of leaves, is much more practical, 
and one which is four feet six across is quite large enough for six 
people. It is a good plan to have one of the leaves cut in half, and 
the addition of a half -leaf will usually make the table large enough 
for eight. People do not want to sit with their elbows pressed 
against their sides, like trussed fowls, and there must be room 
to pass the dishes between them. But after comfort is once 
assured, the closer together people are seated the better for the 
gayety of a dinner. 

The most convenient dining room, so far as service is con- pian of 
cerned, is one in which the door into the pantry is at the farther dimn s 

r J room. 

end, away from the entrance into the room, because the screen, 
which should always hide a pantry door, can in that case also 
hide a table from which the service of the table is performed. 
Besides the dining-table with its chairs, and the sideboard, Theside- 
every dining-room should have a serving-table, which is usually board - 
of polished wood, with a shelf across it halfway down. This 
table is in view of the guests, and on it are placed the finger- 
bowls with their doilies and plates, and any reserve glasses or 
; table accessories which are pretty to look at, such as the cakes 
'for dessert. Decanters of wine always look well standing on 



48 



MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 



Carving. the sideboard until the time for wine serving. The carving can 
be done in the pantry if there is no way of concealing what may 
be called a working serving-table, but if one can be placed be- 
side the pantry door and behind the screen, it is a great advan- 
tage, as it obviates much opening of the pantry door, which, by 
the way, should always have a spring and no latch, so that it 
may be pushed open and will close noiselessly. The working 
serving-table is best made of ordinary soft wood, with the legs 
stained dark, and should be covered between meals with any 
table cover which will look well in the room. While in use it has 
a canton flannel undercloth, and a white tablecloth over that, 
folded like a scarf lengthways, so that it may not interfere with 
the servants' feet. It should be large enough to admit of the 
carving being done on it comfortably, and on it the butler keeps 
his reserve plates, except those which must be brought in hot 
from the pantry, his knives, forks, spoons, and the other tools of 
his trade. 

Following the principle that the appearance of the table is 
less important than the enjoyment of the dinners, any high orna- 
ment or decoration should be avoided at a little dinner. If your 
guests have to dodge a plant or peer round an urn, in order to 
see their opposite neighbors, they will soon be discouraged, and 
limit themselves to those on their own side. So in preparing 
the table it is a good plan for two persons to take seats on 
opposite sides of the table and move the candles or vases until 
the right position is determined. If candles are used, they 
should be made secure in the sticks and the shade-holders so 
placed that they will slip down steadily as the candle burns. 
The wicks should be lighted for a few moments and then ex- 
tinguished before being placed on the table, so that they may be 
easily relighted just before the guests enter the dining room. 

Flowers. A favorite decoration for a large table is a centerpiece of 

flowers. But those who prefer to enable guests to see one 
another across the table often prefer a piece of silver of graceful 



Table 
decoration. 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 49 

shape, but not too tall in the middle, and slender vases of silver 
or glass, each holding a few flowers. The little dishes holding 
candied fruits, peppermints, nuts, or things of that sort (which 
the French call " thejourbeggars," probably because they appear 
so persistently) stand among these vases. If there are candles 
on a small table, in order to avoid crowding it is better to have 
merely a bowl of flowers in the middle. The bowl should not be 
packed full, nor be flat, squat, and ungraceful in effect. The 
flowers may be stuck into wet sand or moss, or fitted in between 
twigs twisted together in the bottom of the dish, and thus held 
the stems will stand upright and slightly apart, instead of lolling 
over on each other. The custom of laying flowers and leaves, 
or ferns, directly on the tablecloth is not wholly to be recom- 
mended. In the first place, unless they are arranged with great 
taste and skill, they look messy, and then there may be some one 
at the table who cares for flowers, and it will not add to his 
pleasure to see them dying slowly of thirst before his eyes. 

As dinner is supposed to be the pleasant ending of a day, 
the table should convey an impression of rest and simplicity 
when the party is informal. At a large entertainment the dec- 
orations may be elaborate if the host chooses, but if a small 
table is crowded with odds and ends of china and silver, they 
are sure to be soon pushed away, and the effect is fussy and 
untidy. 

Opinions vary as to using colored glass. Some Venetian Glass. 
and French glass is certainly very decorative ; but the beautiful 
color of wine demands pure white glass, and taste now tabooes 
the colored. Elaborately embroidered cloths are also beautiful ; 
but nothing can be handsomer than fine white damask, spotless, 
and looking as though it could easily be washed. 

In the following remarks, the words " butler " and " foot- 
man " are used, because they are immemorially associated with 
table service, but their places may be taken, and very often Table 
are, by a well-drilled waitress and a parlor maid. In large service

establishments, where there are several footmen, the latter do 
most of the service; the butler does not have to touch the 
plates, but he carves, serves the wines and bread, rings from 
the pantry as soon as a course is on the table, to give the cook 
due warning of the next, and always removes the bread 
crumbs. There are other details of his service, but in the pres- 
ent instance we will suppose that the head servant, whether 
man or woman, has but one assistant, with whom he works 
harmoniously. 

The manner of setting a table is pretty much the same in 
all good houses. After the cloth has been put on perfectly 
straight over its undercloth of felt or canton flannel, the 
creases, if it has been folded and not rolled on a roller, should 
be smoothed out with a flatiron, which must not be too hot 
for fear of spoiling the surface of the table. If plates have any 
crest or monogram, this should be carefully put toward the 
middle of the table, and quite straight one with another. 
Napkins are folded the monogram on top, and are laid on the 
plates with a piece of bread or roll placed in the fold in such a 
way that it may be seen. Elaborate devices for napkins are 
entirely out of date. At the right of each plate, with edge 
toward the plate, is a steel knife for the meat and sometimes 
a silver one for fish (although in old-fashioned houses the 
latter are not used), and, if there are oysters, a tiny oyster 
fork. A tablespoon for the soup may go with the knives. At 
the left, tines up, are the forks, never more than three ; a small 
fork, for the fish, which often matches the fish knife, and a large 
one for the first entree. '" The one to be used first is the farthest 
away from the plate. 

Tumblers and glasses, the last articles to be placed on the 
table, as they are easily knocked off and broken, go on the right 
of the plate, and there are as many of the latter as there are 
wines to be given. At a large dinner, for instance, there would 
be one for white wine, one for Sherry, one for Champagne, and 



DINNERS AND DINNES-GIVING 51 

one for good claret. Table claret is drunk from the tumbler. 
Glasses for Port or Madeira are not put on the table until these 
wines are served. The glasses must be placed in groups, the 
water glass nearest the plate, and the wine glass to be first used 
nearest the edge of the table. 

Everything needed in serving the dinner should be in its 
place, the platter for the hot dishes in the hot closet, and on 
the side table, the extra silver, cutlery, and china ; also bowls 
of cracked ice. There should be possible no delay in serving. 

The butler keeps count of guests as they arrive, and when seating the 
all is in readiness he comes to the door of the drawing room and ^ eata - 
says "the dinner is served." 

If there are cards with the guests' names, these are laid Use of 
on the cloth, at the top of the plate, or at one side, wher- car ' 
ever they may be most easily seen. The host always comes 
into the dining room first, with the lady who is to sit on his 
right, and who is helped first; the hostess comes in last 
of all. In the case of a very high official, the hostess goes in 
first with him, but these suggestions do not deal with questions 
of precedence. As the hostess usually knows the plan of the 
dinner table, and where different people are to sit, cards will 
not be necessary except for a large dinner. Here good servants 
are of use, for they may quietly help her by indicating where 
different people belong. 

As soon as a guest is seated, and has taken his napkin and Serving the 
bread from his plate, the butler puts down on it another on courses - 
which are oysters, clams, or melons, according to the season, 
neatly arranged on a small doily. Oysters and clams should be 
served on plates of cracked ice, six or eight on each plate, with 
a quarter of a lemon in the centre. Although the former are 
said to be better if eaten from their deep shell, for formal 
dinners they look rather prettier on their flat upper one. The 
plates should be placed on the plates already in front of each 
guest, after the napkins have been lifted. As the butler puts

down the oysters or clams, the footman should follow with a 
small silver tray on which are black cayenne, liquid red pepper, 
and grated horseradish. Brown-bread sandwiches, cut very 
thin, and spread with unsalted butter, are also handed with this 
course. Black pepper and sifted sugar are the accompaniments 
of melons. 

When the oysters have been eaten, their plates are taken 
away, and the soup plate is put down on the plate which was 
on the table at the beginning. When caviar sandwiches or 
anchovy toast are served instead of oysters, they are always 
handed, and when the plates on which they have been eaten 
are taken away, the bare cloth is left, on which the soup plate 
is put down. In England the soup is always put down directly 
on the table, and there is no prejudice against seeing the bare 
Serving the cloth between courses, which makes service much easier than 
when plates are put down and whisked off again unused. The 
next course is soup, which is brought in from the pantry in 
a tureen, provided there is the " working serving-table," safely 
hidden by a screen. If there is no second serving-table, the 
soup is served from the pantry. The butler has the soup plates 
ready, and ladles the soup into them with a ladle or often a 
tea-cup, about six tablespoonfuls being considered the proper 
quantity to put in each plate, and the footmen set the soup 
plate in the front of each guest. 

When this course is finished, the two plates should be 
removed and replaced by a clean one. Plates should always be 
lifted by the left hand, and the fresh ones put in their places 
by the right. Then the hors d'ceuvres, such as celery, olives, 
etc., are passed on a tray. These plates are then replaced by 
hot ones for the fish. 

In placing plates for the fish, the butler takes one in 
hand, and goes round the table from right to left, usually 
beginning with the lady who sits on the host's right. He 
should always put down the first plate with his left hand, 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 53 

and then transfer the other, that he may put it down with the 
left hand also, and this rule applies to all table service. The 
reason for it may easily be seen if any one will take the trouble 
to try the experiment when people are sitting at a table, of 
serving with one hand and then the other. He will find that 
if he uses the left hand he faces the guest, and takes up much 
less room than if he tries to use his right, because that brings 
his shoulder in the way. Knives are the only things properly 
put on the table with the right hand, because they are slipped 
on the table at a guest's right, other service being always at 
the left. In putting on forks the butler goes from left to 
right, because it is easier to slip them in at the left side. 

Boiled or fried fish is served upon a napkin, but with a baked Serving 
fish a napkin is not used, as it is often customary to pour sauce fish- 
over the baked fish. The fish is passed, each guest helping him- 
self. Smel ts are invaluable for dinners, because it is so easy to 
help one's self to them, or fillets of fish, which often have 
their sauce on the dishT^ If broiled shad is given, each piece 
should be carefully cut apart from the others on the dish, 
before it is handed, so that it may be lifted easily, and the 
same rule applies to boiled and baked fish. With boiled fish, 
boiled potatoes cut into small balls are sometimes served, 
though not so often as formerly; with baked or fried fish, 
sliced cucumbers, made very cold, with dressing of oil and 
vinegar. 

For a dinner of six there should always be two servants, if Service for 
possible, and even then, unless they work well together, things 
which should be served at the same time do not always manage 
to make connections. We can all remember feasts where he 
who came last in order of service did not get any sauce until 
his fish was cold, nor any vegetable until he had eaten his 
meat. The butler should hand the fish, and the footman follow 
him with the sauce and cucumbers, for instance, on the same 
tray.

Quick 
service. 



Entree. 



Carving a 
dish of meat. 



The ideal dinner for quick service is one where everything 
is taken directly from the kitchen to the plate, and where no 
carving nor division is needed. For instance, if there are 
smelts, lamb chops with peas in the same dish, and small birds, 
the party stands a better chance of getting away from the 
table in good time than if they are given broiled shad, spring 
lamb, and roast chicken, each of which requires time spent on 
it between the kitchen and table. Young housekeepers will 
spare themselves much anguish of mind by remembering this, 
especially if they have only maids, as not one woman in a hun- 
dred has been taught to carve well and quickly. 

At restaurants the dish ordered is usually shown to the 
giver of the dinner before it is taken away to be cut up, but 
this is not done in a private house. 

It is usual, but by no means obligatory, to have an entree 
between the fish and the meat. 

The entree is always handed; and when it has been eaten, 
the second fork which was put on the table when it was set 
will have been used. If but two were placed at first, fresh 
forks must be given for the meat. After the entree plate 
has been removed, the butler takes the requisite number of 
knives on a small tray, and places them first, following them 
with the forks, and putting them on as we have just described. 
Fresh knives and forks should never be put on the table during 
a course, nor laid on the clean plate. 

If the dish of meat must be carved, the butler does it at the 
serving-table or in the pantry, and the footman can easily take 
two plates, one in either hand. By the time he has put on 
four plates he may begin to hand the sauce or vegetables, as 
the butler, if he is at all quick, can easily finish the carving 
for eight people, let us say, and can then put down the last 
four plates. Ordinarily, in this country, as soon as a plate 
which has been used is taken away, a clean one is put in its 
place, which is all right if the next dish is to be handed ; but if 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 55 

each guest is to be helped to his share, it will be better from 

the point of view of service not to put on any plates after the 

last preceding course, as it is manifestly impossible, with one 

pair of hands, to get an empty plate out of the way, and put Bemoving 

two full ones down. As a general rule, no plate should be plates - 

removed at any course until every one at the table has finished, 

but this rule must be broken sometimes at a large dinner, as 

one talkative or deliberate person may keep the whole service 

back indefinitely. 

Our service, which is mainly modelled on that of the French, 
differs from theirs in two particulars. We serve a separate 
vegetable such as artichokes, cauliflower, or asparagus between 
the principal dish of meat and the game, whereas the French 
prefer it after the latter, and we usually serve cheese, for some 
strange reason, before the sweet dish, while in Europe it comes 
just before the fruit, as it is especially intended to take away 
the taste of sweet things from the palate, and prepare it for the 
fine wines, such as port and madeira, which are served with the 
fruit. Cheese is often replaced in England by various dishes Cheese. 
known as "savories," and they are gaining ground in this 
country. A typical savory is made of cheese, highly seasoned 
with red pepper, in a souffle, or small sandwiches of caviar are 
handed as a savory, the object being always to stimulate appe- 
tite, or rather thirst. If frozen punch is to be used, it must Frozen 
come before the game. It is generally served in small glasses, v mah - 
one standing on each plate with small spoon on the plate with 
the glass. 

Supposing that the dish of meat has been followed by a 
vegetable, such as asparagus, the next course would be game, 
and this may be preceded or replaced by what is called a 
" chaudfroid," for which there is no name in English. Its 
French title, however, " hotcold," describes it well. A chaud- 
froid is something which has necessarily been cooked, therefore 
was hot, but which is cold when one eats it. Fillets of game or Chaudfroid.

service. 



poultry with a cold sauce, for instance, is a very common chaud- 
froid, and salad is served with these dishes, as with game or 
pates. Some people like crescent-shaped side plates for salad, 
which is sensible when game is served, for the cold dressing and 
the hot juice do not mingle well, but on the other hand they take 
up room and complicate the service. Spring chickens, squabs, 
or a fine old ham may take the place of game, or again, at an 
informal dinner, cheese may be served with the salad. 

After the last course, which is usually the cheese, with 
which bread or biscuits are served, the crumbs should be re- 
moved from the table. If there are many large pieces of bread 
or rolls left, the footman should go first and pick up each one 
with a fork, placing it upon a clean plate which he holds in his 
other hand, and he is followed by the butler, who collects the 
crumbs with a silver scoop or scraper, or, in some houses, with 
a clean napkin folded over into a small roll. This, however, is 
not as effective as the silver scoop. All plates, small silver, 
salts and peppers, hors d'ceuvres, and glasses which will not be 
again needed, are taken off the table. 

Then the dessert and fruit plates with the finger-bowls are 
put before the guests. Each fruit plate bears a small ornamental 
doily with a finger-bowl about one-third full of water with the 
chill off, and often with a sprig of rose geranium or verbena in it, 
or a few violets or pansies. With the plates are placed fork, 
dessert spoon, and fruit knife. After the hostess lifts her 
finger-bowl from her plate, the guests lift theirs. The dessert 
is now passed, each individual helping himself. The dessert 
plates are then removed, and plates are then served for fruit, 
fresh and candied, etc., which are then handed. 

Dessert being finished, the hostess leads the ladies to the 
drawing room and the gentlemen follow soon, after coffee and 
liqueurs have been served to them and those have smoked who 
wish to do so. The smoking may take place either in the din- 
ing room or smoking room or library, as circumstances dictate. 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 57 

At the same time coffee and liqueurs are also served to the 
ladies in the drawing room ; while later in the evening, after the 
gentlemen have joined the ladies, apollinaris or some other 
sparkling mineral water is handed. 

A smart dinner to-day is served in an hour, or very little 
longer, and as the gentlemen do not stay in the smoking room 
more than fifteen or twenty minutes, and the company remains 
together in the drawing-room for about the same time, it is easy 
to see that the whole entertainment may be easily got through 
with in a couple of hours, leaving the rest of the evening free. 
This is an immense improvement over the ponderous feasts of 
even a dozen years ago, when people sat for hours in a hot room 
eating five times as much as they wanted, and perhaps tired to 
death of their companions. 

We have spoken here of a small dinner, for six or eight, but Service for 
the same general rules apply to larger ones. At these, two ^ rger 
soups, a thick and a clear one, are still often given, the footman 
carrying both soup plates, and saying to each guest, for instance, 
"Julienne or gumbo?" A light entree, such as a souffle of 
cheese, or chicken in little cases, or a vol-au-vent is sometimes 
served between the soup and the fish ; the fish is in some 
rather ornamental form, such as little fillets, but the useful fried 
smelt still holds his place. Then comes another entree, perhaps 
of sweetbreads or a mousse or timbale. Then the meat, the 
separate vegetable, the roast or chaudfroid with salad, the sweet 
dish, or even two of them, such as a baba followed by ice-cream, 
or the second sweet may be replaced by a savory. 

The necessity for good service cannot be too much insisted 

upon. One servant to five guests is the very smallest number Proportion 

with which a large dinner can be well carried off, and then onlv ? f serTi * nts

if the servants are used to working together. It is better to 

allow one to four, especially if you have to call in professional 

waiters. For this reason it is more economical to have eighteen 

people rather than sixteen ; you will need four servants to take

proper care of the smaller number, and they can just as well . 
manage two more. Unless you have an accomplished chef, or 
a cordon bleu, be careful to have only dishes which your cook 
| knows by heart and is sure to make well ; a large dinner strains . 
the resources of an ordinary establishment, and is no time for 
experiment or uncertainty. If your artist sometimes fails in 
her clear soups, but has a talent for creams and purees, choose 
one of the latter, and select entrees with which she always sue- ■ 
ceeds. No matter whether some or all of your guests have had 
the same thing at your house before, they will probably not 
' notice if they are enjoying themselves ; and even if they do, it is 
infinitely better than that there should be a dreary pause, fol- 
lowed by some dish which is an evident failure, to the mortifica- 
tion of the hostess. 
Service for If there are more than ten people, two dishes of everything 

more than w hi c h { s handed should be started at the same time, as it takes

too long for one to make its way round. Service begins with 
the lady who sits on the host's right, or whom he has taken in; 
' but when there are two dishes, the second should start with the 
\ hostess, who sets a good example by helping herself, whether 
she wants any or not, and also makes the first cut into a timbale 
or anything of that sort. 
Butler's • A clearly written list of the dinner, with the accessories to 
duties. | gg^k course> should be posted in the pantry, and each servant 
should know what he or she is to do. If the butler is compe- 
tent, he will, of course, attend to this, and if possible he should 
never leave the dining room, where his especial duty, besides 
carving, is, as his name implies, to serve wines. These commonly 
are now : a white wine with the oysters, and Sherry with the 
soup ; Champagne is served with the fish, and continued through- 
out the dinner ; good claret is given with the roast and game, 
Wines. Port with the cheese or savory, and Madeira with the fruit ; but 

the only real necessaries are Sherry and Champagne. Madeira 
should always be served with terrapin. Table claret is often

offered after the soup, and if a guest accepts, his glass is filled 
about a third full, and he is given his choice of plain or mineral 
water. Both of these waters should just have come off the ice, 
but it is better to put none in the tumblers, as some people dis- 
like it. In these days of gout and diet, so many persons drink 
Scotch whiskey and soda that it is usually offered, especially 
if Champagne is refused ; and if whiskey is accepted, it is often 
served in tall glasses, which are ready on the sideboard, leaving 
the ordinary tumblers for water. These water tumblers should 
not, by the way, be filled beforehand, as is sometimes done. 

Good claret should stand in a warm room before it is wanted, 
to let it settle and get mellow, for if it comes directly from the 
cellar it has a rough taste and no bouquet. 

Sherry for soup, on the other hand, is better if it has been 
kept all day in a bottle in the ice-chest, and only decanted just 
before dinner. A " brut " Champagne is usually served now, so 
cold that it is almost oily when poured out, with very little 
foam. This does not mean that it is flat, however, for the little 
bubbles of gas may be seen rising steadily from the bottom. 

Although this chapter is nominally limited to dinners, a Luncheons. 

few words may be added about luncheon, whicb, among people 

who go out or entertain much, is not the elaborate function 

sometimes described. If the hostess is so lucky as to have a 

handsome mahogany table, there is often no cloth to hide it. 

There may be a centrepiece of lace or embroidery, and in that 

case it is pretty to have it match the napkins or doilies, and 

. also the other little doilies which protect the table from being 

j scratched by the plateSi A Grapefruit, bouillon, or clam broth 

. is served first, and then there may be eggs in some ornamental 

fashion, stuffed, or with a sauce, or else lobster in chops, or a la 

Newburg, or broiled smelts — any little dish of eggs or fish. 

Then may come lamb chops, or little fillets of any meat, with 

potatoes and one other vegetable, and then birds or broiled 

chicken, or an aspic of some sort, with a salad, and afterward an 



60 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

omelette souffle, a biscuit, or ice-cream. Black coffee is served 
afterward. Sherry and claret, or white wine, are usually on 
the table; whiskey and soda may be offered, but most ladies 
drink only mineral water at luncheon. Champagne should be 
served only late in tKeTday. A simple luncheon would con- 
sist of eggs or fish in some form, one dish of meat, and cold 
ham with salad, or cream cheese with jam, followed by stewed 
fruit or custards baked in little cups. In summer the mistress 
and the cook should exercise their ingenuity in devising all 
I sorts of attractive cold dishes, and a good butler can always 
make several varieties of cup, although many persons prefer 
iced tea or coffee. 

We add three simple menus, for dinners of six, ten, and 

sixteen people respectively. Fourteen, by the way, is a number 

to be avoided if possible, as among so many some one is likely 

to drop out at the last moment, leaving one with the dreaded 

thirteen.

WINES. 

Decanting, "Warming, Cooling, and Serving. 

Wines and liquors are commonly in the keeping of the 
butler — in fact, the word " butler " is derived from the Latin 
buticula, a little bottle, through the French bouteillier, bottler. 
In the drinking habits of the old days, the care of the wine and 
liquors and the constant and gross serving of them might have 
kept a man busy in a menage of not great size. In our own 
times, however, when wines are so commonly bought bottled, 
and the organization of households has become more complex, 



62 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

the duties of butler have broadened and refined. Still the 
butler in these times has charge of the bottling and binning 
and of the temperature of the wine cellar or wine room, and 
he should know enough of that strange and living thing called 
wine to help his employer choose the right material, if his ad- 
vice is asked, and to keep all wines and liquors in his charge 
under conditions most favorable to their development and per- 
fection. He should never leave wine in cases, but unpack and 
bin it as soon as it arrives. 

Rules for the decanting of wine have from time to time been 
given, but for Ports and clarets and such as show a deposit on 
the bottle, none are better than the following: — 

In decanting, the butler should first take all possible care in 
removing the bottles from their bins, and never fail to lay the 
bottle down on the side it has been lying in the bin. The de- 
posit the wine has cast upon the side of the bottle not only 
destroys the brilliancy of the wine, but also its flavor and 
aroma. Then he should be sure of the quality of each bottle, 
that is, he should guard against serving bottles tasting or smell- 
ing of corks rotten or decayed by fungous growths. It is hardly 
necessary to add that he should see that his decanter is brilliantly 
clean inside and out. 

After he has taken the bottle of wine out of the bin he 
should carefully lay it on the table, keeping still the same posi- 
tion. If two laths have been nailed on his decanting table, he 
will have gained a steady base for work. Let him hold the 
bottle tightly with one hand, and after slowly tipping it obliquely 
till the wine no longer touches the cork, he should apply his 
corkscrew and extract the cork without the slightest shake or 
movement to the bottle. 

A candle set the other side of the bottle will permit him to 
see through the wine, and in drawing it into the decanter he 
should watch its condition. As soon as the cloud or deposit in 
the bottle nears the neck, he should stop ; for not a particle of 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 63 

such deposit, cloud or crust, should flow into the decanter. But 
this clouded wine should not be wasted. It will mix, especially 
if Port wine or Sherry. Put the bottoms of wines together in 
the kitchen-use bottle ; for such mixtures are good for flavoring 
soups, puddings, and jellies. 

Another good old-fashioned rule in decanting is this : When 
a bottle is three-fourths decanted, even if the deposit is still un- 
disturbed, decant the remainder in a wine glass, and add from 
the glass to the decanter, as long as the cloud does not reach 
the glass. 

Do not decant more wine than will be needed. The aroma 
is lost if the wine is too much exposed. Heavier wines should be 
decanted first ; the lighter wines later, since their ethers are more 
volatile. Old Sherry may be decanted the day before it is used, 
and the decanter left without its stopper. Hock, upon the other 
hand, should be decanted an hour before it is served. Some 
judges of wine would decant claret as it is wanted, having kept 
it at a temperature of seventy degrees for ten or twelve hours 
before serving, while others would decant it two hours before it 
is drunk. Port should be decanted not more than two or three 
hours before it is served. Champagne it is not necessary to de- 
cant when it is under ten years old. In opening Champagne 
bottles, cut the wire and strings at the bottle's rim. Then hold 
the cork down with the left thumb and with a pointed piece of 
wood cleanse the rim. Extract the cork slowly so that no noise 
is caused, and have glasses at hand to hold the flow of a lively 
bottle. 

In serving wines the taste of the guests should be considered, 
and after that the occasion, and the temperature and humidity 
of the outdoor air. Some temperaments and physiques with 
blood oxygenated by an outdoor life enjoy a heavier and rich 
wine ; the sedentary student is apt to take a lighter and drier 
vintage: The milder wines naturally come first. If more than 
one quality of a wine is served, the younger should come first. 



64 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Claret should be served warm — not warmer than eighty de- 
grees and not cooler than sixty-five degrees. The medium point 
of seventy degrees brings out the qualities of the wine. The 
bouquet is lost if it is too warm. Bordeaux and Burgundy 
should have the same temperature as claret, except Chablis and 
other white Burgundy, which should be at forty-five degrees. 
Port should be served at a temperature of from fifty to fifty-six 
degrees — the point fifty -five is a much approved one. Madeira 
takes sixty-five degrees as the temperature best adapted to its 
constitution, Sauterne and other white claret fifty degrees, and 
Sherry is best at forty or forty-two degrees. Champagne should 
have a temperature of thirty-four. To cool this wine, lay it on 
ice, the sweet several hours before using, the dry for half or 
three-quarters of an hour. In laying the bottles on the ice, or 
in a pan of cracked ice, have care not to shake the bottle. 

With oysters may go Chablis, Sauterne, a light Moselle or 
Hock. 

After soup, an old Madeira or Tokay or Sherry. 

With fish, Sauterne, Hock, Chablis. 

With entrees, Claret, Bordeaux, Burgundy. 

With roasts, Champagne, Moselle, or fair claret. 

With game, Burgundy, claret. 

Sweets, Madeira, Port, Sherry or Champagne. 

People of a discriminating palate often pronounce for one 
good wine at a dinner. That wine, it should be added, is not 
Champagne — the drinking of which with all kinds of food 
some epicures pronounce a gastronomic sin. The same authority 
also advises us to avoid as poisons the serving and drinking of 
all brandies, whiskeys, and sodas, after wine. 



CHAPTER II 

Selection of Fish 

Fbbsh fish are hard when pressed by the finger ; the gills 
red, the eyes full. If the flesh is flabby and the eyes sunken, 
the fish are stale. Fish should be thoroughly washed, cleaned, 
wiped, and sprinkled with salt. 

The earthy taste often found in fresh-water fish can be re- 
moved by soaking it in salt water. Most kinds of salt fish 
should be soaked in cold water for twenty -four hours, the fleshy 
side turned down in the water. Never soak fresh fish in water 
unless frozen. 

Before broiling fish rub the gridiron with a piece of fat to pre- 
vent the fish sticking. Lay the skin side down first. 

In boiling put the fish into cold water to which a little salt 
and vinegar have been added. Serve fish always with sauce. 

Selection of Meats 

In selecting beef, choose that of a fine smooth grain, of a 
bright red color and white fat. » The third, fourth, fifth, and 
sixth ribs of beef are the choicest cuts for a roast. Have the 
bones removed and the meat rolled. The butcher should send 
the bones for a soup. 

The flesh of good veal is firm and dry and the joints stiff. 

The flesh of good mutton or lamb is a bright red, with the 
fat firm and white. 

If the meat of pork is young, the lean will break on being 
pinched, the fat will be white, soft, and pulpy. 

To judge the Age of Poultry and Game 
The breast-bone should bend easily from side to side. 
Broilers are best from one to two pounds. Fowls for roasting

66 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

can be judged by tbe wings. If tbe skin breaks when the wing 
is turned toward the head, the fowl is tender. Old fowls have 
scaly legs and the breast-bone is hard and will not bend. 

Turkey. The cock bird has a smooth black leg with a short 
spur. The eyes are bright and full and the feet supple when 
the bird is fresh. The absence of these signs denotes age and 
staleness. The hen bird may be judged by the same rules. 

Creese. In young geese the feet and bill are yellow and free 
from hair. When fresh, the feet are pliable; they are stiff 
when stale. 

Buck may be judged by the same rule. 

Plover when fat have hard vents, but like all other birds 
may be chosen by the above rules. 

In the partridge yellow legs and a dark bill are signs by 
which a young bird may be known. Rigid vent, when fresh ; 
when this part is green, the bird is stale. 

Pheasants. The young birds are known by the short or 
rounded spur which in the old is long and pointed. 

Crrouse, woodcock, and quail may be chosen by the above 

rules. ,i t

Rules for boiling Meat 

All fresh meat, unless for soup, should be put into boiling water. The 
outer part is contracted by the heat, and the juices are preserved. The meat 
should be allowed to cook very gently and no salt added until it is nearly 
done. 

In boiling meats it is important to keep the water constantly boiling, 
otherwise the meat will absorb the water. Be careful to add boiling water 
if more is needed. Remove the scum when it first begins to boil. Allow 
about twenty minutes for boiling for each pound of fresh meat. The more 
gently the meat boils, the more tender it will be.

Salt meats should be put into cold water and boiled slowly, that the salt 
may be extracted in cooking. 

A red pepper dropped into the water will prevent the rising of any un- 
pleasant odor. 
> For making soup put the meat on the fire in cold water.

minutes are required for every pound of beef. Season when nearly done. 

Clean meats by wiping them with a cloth kept for that purpose. Do not 
"ufc meat into water.

To broil Meat Well 

Have your gridiron well greased and hot before you put the meat on. 
Broiling is not only the most rapid manner of cooking meat, but is justly 
a favored one. It has nearly the same effect upon meat as roasting. The 
albumen of the meat is hardened and forming a skin it retains the juices. 
Broiling meat should be turned rapidly in order to produce an equal effect, 
but it should not be punctured with a fork.

Read this Advice 

In cooking follow as far as possible the rule of the druggist in compound- 
ing any mixture, that is, mix the ingredients thoroughly, putting in one at 
a time. For instance, if you have three ingredients mis two before adding 
the third, and stir in the third well before adding a fourth, and so on. All 
compounds gain from following this rule. 

The value of a pan of hot water in cooking cannot be overestimated. 
Set in the upper oven, it insures good baking. If the oven becomes too hot, 
use cold water in the upper pan. In heating vegetables, canned corn for 
instance, upon the top of the range, setting the saucepan in a pan of hot 
water saves much labor and watching. Besides this, the use keeps sauce- 
pans in good condition until fairly worn out. All breakfast grains or cereals 



72 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

should be cooked in this manner. A pan of hot water furnishes a double 
boiler ready at hand at all times. 

A most important kitchen utensil is a good set of scales and weights. 
They are indispensable to assure success in cooking. Without them there 
is no precision in proportioning the various ingredients. Therefore it is 
absolutely necessary to have a set of scales. The cook should bear in mind 
always to put the weights away in their place and to keep the scales in 
thorough order. In weighing anything of a greasy nature the cook should 
place a piece of paper on the scales. By doing this she will save herself 
much trouble, and keep her scales clean. 

Milk and butter should be kept in closely covered vessels so they will 
not absorb odors from other articles. 

The time during which an article is coming to the boiling-point cannot 
be counted in any rule or measure for boiling. 

Always use porcelain-lined pans for cooking fruits or an acid preparation. 



CHAPTER IV 

SOUPS 

Bouillon 

Select a piece of the under round of beef, weighing about 
ten pounds. Trim off all the fat and cut off a piece weighing 
about one pound. Cut the rest in small pieces. Put it in a soup 
kettle with nine pints of water. Let it slowly come to a boil. 
Skim thoroughly and move the kettle back where the liquid will 
keep boiling slowly but steadily for six hours. Then add one 
large onion sliced thin, one slice of carrot, a slice of turnip, and 
a small muslin bag containing the following spices and herbs : 
three dozen pepper corns, six whole cloves, small piece of cin- 
namon, two sprigs of thyme and summer savory, three bay 
leaves, a small leaf of sage, two sprigs of parsley, and three 
blades of celery. Also stir in three teaspoonfuls of salt. Let 
all cook one hour, then draw the kettle to the front of range 
and boil vigorously for one minute. Strain and set away to 
cool. The next day skim off all the grease. Put stock into 
the soup kettle with the piece of meat which was cut off the day 
before. See that it is chopped very fine. Beat the whites of 
three eggs until very light, stir into the kettle with other in- 
gredients. Place on the range and heat slowly to the boiling- 
point. Stir occasionally. When the soup bubbles, move the 
kettle to the back part of the range, cover, and keep just at the 
boiling-point for one hour. Taste to see whether it has suf- 
ficient seasoning. Strain through a wet bag and it is ready to 
serve.

Pot au Feu 



The true way to cook this national dish of France is in an 
earthen pot or pipkin. This pot has a close-fitting lid, is very- 
strong, and is most excellent for the slow cooking which the 
success of the dish demands. The earthen pot may be had in 
this country and also a very good substitute may be purchased. 

The soup or broth is made afresh once or twice a week by 
every family in France not too poor to afford it. It is often 
served on the first day with slices of bread, on the second with 
variations of vermicelli, rice, or other garnishes. The general 
process of making it is always the same. The popular treat- 
ment is thus described by a famous cook : The soup pot of the 
French artisan supplies his principal nourishment and is thus 
managed by his wife, who, without the slightest knowledge of 
chemistry, conducts the process in a truly scientific manner. 
She first lays the meat in her earthen stock pot and pours cold 
water to it in the proportion of about two quarts to three 
pounds of beef. She then places it on the fire where it slowly 
becomes hot, and as it does so the heat enlarges the fibre of the 
meat, dissolves the gelatinous substances which it contains, 
allows the albumen to disengage itself and the most savory parts 
of the meat to be diffused through the broth. From the simple 
circumstance of boiling it in the gentlest manner a savory and 
nutritious soup is obtained and a dish of palatable and tender 
meat. If the pot is placed over a quick fire, the albumen will 
coagulate, harden the meat, prevent the water from penetrating 
it, and the savors of the meat from disengaging themselves, and 
the result will be a broth without flavor or tastiness and a 
tough, dry piece of meat. 

The broth of the dish forms in France the foundation of all 
richer soups and gravies. Poured on fresh meat, it makes an 
excellent consomme. If properly managed, it is clear and pale. 

Poultry, pigeons, and even game may be boiled in the pot 



80VP8 75 

au feu. They should be properly trussed and stewed in the 
broth long enough to make them tender. A small ham also 
may be laid in with the beef when the water is first added. 
Boiled in this bouillon three or four hours, it is superior in 
flavor to a ham cooked in water, and the taste of the ham im- 
proves the soup. But the soup cannot well be eaten the day 
the ham is boiled, for it must be allowed to cool and be freed 
from the fat of the ham. In case you boil a salted ham in the 
soup, you will of course require no other salt. The ham should 
of course be freed from any rusty or blackened parts and washed 
perfectly clean. 

The French housewife begins her pot au feu soon after 
breakfast and puts the ingredients gradually in the pot. Thus 
by the end of the day and the independent cooking of the 
ordinary fire of the kitchen she has her most nutritious, tooth- 
some, and substantial meal. 

One way to make it is this : For a large pot au feu take six 
pounds of good fresh beef, cut it up and pour on it four quarts 
of fresh cold water, set it over the fire, skim it when it simmers, 
and after it has come to a boil add a teaspoon of salt, some pep- 
per, and half a pound of liver cut in pieces. Then add two or 
three large carrots, either sliced or grated, four turnips pared 
and quartered, eight young onions peeled and sliced in thin 
slices, two of the onions roasted whole, a head of celery cut up, 
a parsnip well cut up, six potatoes hand-sliced and quartered, 
tomatoes in season, and in short any appetizing vegetable. A 
bunch of sweet herbs cut small and absorbed by the dish or 
boiled and removed on serving also adds much to the savory 
compound. 

Let the whole continue to boil slowly and steadily for six 
hours. Serve by laying slices of bread in a tureen or deep 
platter, pour the stew or soup upon them, including not only 
the broth but the meat and vegetables. What is left in the 
tureen may go into the pot au feu for next day. 



76 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

For beef you may substitute mutton, venison, or other tooth- 
some meats. 

Pot au Feu 

Take three pounds of lean beef, wind it about with twine to 
keep it from boiling to pieces, lay it in the soup pot, and pour 
over it about six quarts of fresh cold water. Set the pot over 
the fire and when the water begins to boil add two carrots, three 
onions, one having been stuck with three or four cloves, and in 
its season one turnip. To this pot au feu may be also added 
various bones and meats of the larder still sweet and holding 
their natural oils and flavors; for instance, a beefsteak bone, or 
chicken head, etc. 

Let the soup boil slowly six or seven hours, then take it off 
the fire, strain, and set away in a dark, cool place. For immediate 
use take the lower part and every morning skim and bring it to 
a boil so that the supply from which you draw daily may not 
spoil. 

The meat of the pot au feu, which the French call bceuf 
bouilli and eat, is commonly served with the vegetables cooked 
with it and dressed with some piquant sauce, or egg sauce. 

Beef Broth 

Four pounds of soup beef, eight quarts of water, two table- 
spoons of salt. Boil slowly, remove the scum, add one carrot, 
one turnip, one onion with three cloves stuck in it, a clove of 
garlic, two leeks and a stalk of celery tied together. Cover 
partially, add a little water when required to replace that evapo- 
rated, and let simmer five hours. Skim the fat and strain 
through a wet bag. 

Beef Soup 

Take four pounds of beef, not too fat, four whole onions 
medium size, five small carrots or one large one, and cover with 
cold water. When all come to a boil, boil slowly and skim. 



-sows 77 

Then add salt and pepper carefully. Set back on the stove and 
simmer until the meat is very well done. Take off the stove and 
add two or three small strips of green pepper while hot. Set in a 
cold place over night. Next day skim all the grease off, remove 
the beef and vegetables save the carrot. Strain the soup, return 
it to the kettle, add the carrot, boil or simmer until the meat is 
heated well through. Thicken with flour and water stirred 
smoothly until a little thick. Boil rice, well done, in a rice 
boiler. Place a tablespoon of rice in a soup plate and pour the 
soup over it. To this can be added pieces of the meat and 
carrot if desired, or it can be used as a clear soup. It is im- 
proved by chopped parsley added after the soup is thickened, 
and let stand a short time to extract the flavor. 

Mutton Soup 

Mutton makes a very delicate soup boiled according to the di- 
rections for beef soup. Use onions in the same way and flavor 
with a little stewed tomatoes that have been cooked and seasoned. 

Curry Soup 

Put four pounds of lean beef in a kettle and pour over it three 
quarts of cold water and one teaspoonful of salt. Let it stand 
one hour, then set it on the fire and cook slowly for two hours. 
Chop the following: two onions, two potatoes, one small carrot, 
one head of lettuce, and add to the soup. Cook one hour longer, 
then strain. Return to the kettle and add two tablespoonfuls 
of rice, one scant tablespoonful of curry powder, season to taste, 
and cook one hour longer. Serve very hot with cheese straws. 

Ox-tail Soup 

Cut in short pieces two ox tails and soak them in fresh water 
for three hours, changing the water once in a while. Put on the 
fire, cover with cold water, boil five minutes, cool and wash well. 
Drain, put into a saucepan with two quarts of beef broth, two 



78 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

quarts of water, two carrots, one onion with two whole cloves 
stuck in it, a bunch of parsley, a head of celery, and a little salt. 
Then cook slowly for about three hours. With a skimmer 
transfer the tails to another stewpan, drain the carrots, strain 
and free the broth of its fat, and thicken with three ounces of 
flour browned in three ounces of butter. Add two glasses 
of Sherry and a glass of Port wine, white pepper, and a dash of 
cayenne. Boil one hour, skim, and press through a cloth over 
the ox tails. Add the carrot cut in small pieces and two dozen 
small glazed onions. Boil a few minutes longer, skim again, 
and serve. 

Brunoise Soup 

Take two each of the following vegetables : carrots, tur- 
nips, onions, leeks, and a head of celery. Cut them in small 
dice and fry the pieces in a pan over a slow fire with one ounce 
of butter and a little sugar. If the butter be fresh, add a little 
salt. When the vegetables are a light brown, pour over them 
three quarts of light stock, either veal or chicken. When this 
comes to a boil, skim it thoroughly and remove to the side of 
the stove to boil gently until the vegetables are cooked. Then 
add one-half pint of green peas, a handful of French beans cut 
in diamond shape, and one-half pint of asparagus tips, these 
vegetables to be boiled beforehand. After testing the flavor 
and seasoning, serve very hot. 

Flemish Soup 

Have' at hand carrots, turnips, and cucumbers, two of each. 
Peel the latter and scrape the first. Then with a vegetable 
scoop cut them in fancy shapes about as big as an olive. Cut 
the white part of two heads of celery and three leeks in thick 
shreds about half an inch long. Blanch or parboil these for 
five minutes, drain them on a sieve and place in a soup kettle 
capable of holding about three quarts. Add two generous 



S0UP8 79 

quarts of consomme or stock. Boil until the vegetables are 
sufficiently done. Boil slowly and skim occasionally. While 
the soup is boiling, boil the following vegetables, which when 
blanched add to the soup : one handful of Brussels sprouts, 
one-half pint of young peas, a few French beans cut small, and 
a handful of asparagus heads. Add a pinch of coarse white 
pepper. Let the soup boil three or four minutes. Place some 
dried croutons in a tureen, pour the soup upon them and serve. 

Hollandaise Soup 

Peel two carrots, the same number of turnips and cucumbers, 
and cut them into the shape of small olives. After blanching 
them, boil them in one quart of strong white broth, made of veal 
or chicken. When the vegetables are cooked, remove from the 
range and add the yolks of four eggs mixed with twice as much 
water as there is egg liquid, one gill of cream, and a small lump 
of butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir over the 
fire until the soup is of the desired consistency and then pour into 
the soup tureen containing one gill of young peas and an equal 
quantity of French beans boiled tender and cut into diamonds. 
Serve very hot. 

Julienne Soup 

Cut lengthwise in short fine shreds two carrots, two turnips, 
two stalks of celery, the whites of two leeks, a white onion, and 
a few white cabbage leaves. Mix all, and with four ounces of 
butter set them on the fire. Stir occasionally until quite dry. 
Then add three quarts of beef broth. Boil slowly for forty -five 
minutes. Skim off all the fat, add one scant teaspoonful sugar 
and one-half pint of small, cooked green peas. Boil two minutes 
longer with a handful of chervil, sorrel, and lettuce leaves cut in 

fine shreds. 

White Broth 

Place in a kettle over a moderate fire a heavy knuckle of 
veal with all the scraps of meat, including bones — not of game 



80 MBS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

— at hand. Cover fully with cold water and add one handful 
of salt. As it comes to a boil, skim carefully. No scum should 
be left on. Then put in two large well-scraped carrots whole, 
one whole well-cleaned turnip, one large peeled onion whole, one 
well-cleaned parsley root, three thoroughly washed leeks, and a 
few leaves of cleaned celery. Boil very slowly on the corner of 
the range. Skim the grease off. Then strain through a wet 
cloth into an earthen bowl. Set away in cool place for use 
when needed. 

Consomm6 with Vegetables 

Put in a soup kettle one roasted fowl, two pounds of lean 
veal, some roast beef bones (if convenient), two pounds of soup 
meat, eight quarts of water, two tablespoonfuls of salt. Boil 
slowly for four hours. Skim well. Then add one carrot, one 
onion, one-half a parsnip, one turnip, two leeks, and a few pepper- 
corns. Let all simmer for four hours. Remove all the fat and 
strain through a wet cloth. This broth should be very clear and 
of a rich yellow color. With a small tin tube cut round pieces 
of carrot and turnip in thin slices, add a leek cut crosswise. Par- 
boil them, drain, and then boil one hour with three quarts of the 
broth. Add a finely sliced small heart of lettuce, sorrell, and 
chervil leaves; boil ten minutes longer. Finish with a little 
sugar and three tablespoonfuls of small green asparagus tops. 
Pour into a soup tureen with the crusts of two French rolls cut 
in small rounds and dried in the oven. Cover the tureen. Be 
sure to serve it hot. 

Mock Turtle Soup, with Chicken Forcemeat Balls; 
with Egg Balls 

Begin making the soup the day before it will be wanted. A 
calf's head is one of the articles needed, but a part of it may be 
used for dishes other than the soup. The following ingredients 
will make six quarts of soup : one calf's head, one shin of 



SOUPS 81 

veal weighing six pounds, one onion, two tablespoonfuls of 
chopped carrot, two tablespoonfuls of chopped turnip, three 
stalks of celery, a piece of stick cinnamon about three inches 
long, one-half a blade of mace, ten whole cloves, twenty white 
peppercorns, a bay leaf, one sprig of parsley, four tablespoonfuls 
of butter, six of corn-starch, a tablespoon each of walnut, mush- 
room, and tomato catsup, two lemons, a quantity of cold water, 
one gill or more of Port, salt and pepper, and, if one chooses, 
some egg or forcemeat balls. It may seem as if six quarts of 
soup were too large a quantity, therefore it may be well to say, 
in explanation, that a calf's head is sufficient for that quantity, 
and half of a head cannot be bought. If all the soup be not 
wanted at one meal, it may be warmed again. 

Have the butcher split and scrape the calf's head and saw 
the bone of the shin of veal into several parts. Wash all care- 
fully. Put the head into a large pan, covering it with cold 
water. Soak it for two hours. At the end of that time take 
out the brains, place the head in a large soup pot, and after 
putting in the shin also, pour in eight quarts of cold water. 
Heat it slowly to the boiling-point. Then skim carefully and 
set the pot back where the liquor will simply bubble for three 
hours. When that time has passed, take up the veal with a 
skimmer and then remove the head, being careful not to break 
it. Strain the stock that is in the soup pot and put all but two 
quarts away to cool. These two quarts should be returned to 
the kettle with the shin of veal; the spice mentioned above 
should be added and the kettle covered and set where its con- 
tents will only simmer. Now put the vegetables, cut fine, and 
the butter into a frying pan and fry gently for twenty minutes. 
At the last moment draw the pan forward so that the vegetables 
may become slightly browned by more rapid cooking. Be care- 
ful they do not get burned. Add these vegetables to the veal 
and stock and cook all for four hours. Then strain and put 
away to cool. 



82 MES. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

The next morning, after skimming off all the fat, turn the two 
lots of strained stock into the soup pot and set upon the stove. 
Add the catsup, also salt and pepper in quantities to suit your 
taste ; and when the soup boils up add the juice of a lemon, the 
wine, and the face of the calf cut into small strips. Cover the 
soup pot closely and set it back where its contents will hardly 
bubble during the next fifteen minutes. It will then be ready 
to serve ; but if it be intended for a late dinner it may be cooled, 
put away, and heated again when wanted. Tbin slices of lemon 
cut in quarters and egg balls and forcemeat balls should be put 
into the tureen before the soup is turned into it, if one would have 
mock turtle soup in perfection. As it takes much time to make 
forcemeat balls, they may be omitted, but egg balls are easily 
prepared and should be used. 

Chicken Forcemeat Balls 

Chop very fine half of the breast of a tender chicken, pound 
it in a mortar and rub it through a coarse sieve. There should 
be a generous cupful of the meat after it has been rubbed through 
the sieve. Pour one quarter of a cup of cream into a saucepan 
with a scant quarter of a cup of fine bread crumbs and a bit of 
whole mace. Cook until the mixture forms a smooth paste. 
It will take about ten minutes. Remove the mace and add one 
tablespoonful of butter, salt, and white pepper to taste, the 
meat, and the white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth. Mix 
well, and when cool form in balls about the size of grapes. 
Have ready a pan of salted boiling water. Cook the balls for 
five minutes, turn them in a strainer and then add them to the 
mock turtle soup. The above balls may be prepared three or 
four hours before the soup is served. 

-_: Egg Balls 
Boil four eggs for twenty minutes until hard. Plunge them 
in cold water and remove the shell. Pound the yolks in a 



soups 83 

mortar until they become a smooth paste. Then add one tea- 
spoonful of salt, a little white pepper, and a well-beaten raw 
egg. Mould the mixture into balls about the size of grapes, 
and roll them in flour. Fry in hot fat until they become a light 
brown. Turn them frequently while they are cooking. 

French Mock Turtle Soup 

Put in soup kettle half a shin of beef. Let the meat stand 
in cold water one hour, add one tablespoonful of salt to draw 
out the blood, then put on the fire and cook for six hours. 
Skim off all the grease and scum that rise for the first hour. 
Strain and set aside until the next day. Take a nice calf's 
head, parboil it, take the meat off and cut in inch square pieces. 
Take off the fat from the soup. Cut up two onions, one carrot, 
two fresh mushrooms, one clove of garlic, and one blade of mace. 
Whip up the whites and yolks of three eggs. Mix them in 
with the vegetables. Pour over them the cold stock and set 
on back of the range. Let mixture boil up slowly, stirring 
until it comes to a boil. Then let it boil slowly for twenty 
minutes. Then strain. It should be clear. Add the meat 
from calf's head. Continue to boil until tender. Drop in some 
egg balls, one glass Madeira wine. Serve very hot. 

Dubarry Soup 

Prepare two quarts of clear chicken bouillon. When ready, 
add one cup of washed and drained rice and boil until it is 
tender. Then rub through a sieve. Add one cup of boiled 
cauliflower pulp which has also been rubbed through a sieve. 
Thin this mixture to the desired consistency with cream. 
Season to taste with salt and white pepper and add the well- 
beaten yolks of two eggs mixed with some of the cream. Stir 
over the fire until the mixture comes to a boil. Cut some 
truffles in small pieces, mix with the soup, and serve very hot. 



84 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Mulligatawny Soup 

Cut up two chickens as for a fricassee, place them in a pan 
with one carrot, one onion, one head of celery, and a bouquet. 
Cover with a good broth made of veal, and when the chicken is 
almost done, strain them off into a sieve, saving their broth in 
a basin. Plunge the pieces of chicken in cold water to blanch 
them, drain, and set away for future use. Now cut four large 
onions in half, remove the root part, and again cut them into 
slices. Place in a pan with four ounces of butter, a carrot, and 
two heads of celery cut in small pieces. Fry these until the 
onion is nearly melted, then stir in as much flour as will suffice 
to thicken the quantity of soup you wish to make. Stir this 
on the fire for a few minutes, and after stirring in one teaspoon- 
ful of curry powder and the same quantity of curry paste, 
gradually add the broth the chickens were boiled in and as much 
more veal broth as desired to make the required amount. When 
it comes to a boil, set it at one side of the range to clarify or 
settle. Rub it through a wet cloth and pour it over the pieces 
of chicken. Half an hour before dinner, stir the soup over the 
fire until it comes to a boil, then set it to one side and boil it 
slowly for ten minutes. By that time the chicken will be done. 
Skim the soup, and after tasting it to determine the seasoning, 
serve it with plain boiled rice in a separate dish. 

Puree of Game 

Skin and clean two fat wild rabbits and wipe them with a 
wet towel. Remove the fillets and free them from all the thin 
skin and sinews. Draw and clean two partridges, remove all 
the breast meat, lift up the skin and free the meat of the small 
sinews. Put the fillets aside for future use. Cut all the car- 
casses in small pieces. Place them in a soup kettle with a scant 
five quarts of beef stock. Place over a hot fire and watch until 
it begins to boil and remove all the scum and grease. Season 



soups 85 

with two white onions, three medium-sized carrots, two leeks 
tied with a small bay leaf and a very small bunch of thyme, one 
tablespoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of black pepper. 
After adding the seasoning, let the mixture boil slowly for one 
hour and a half. Leave the kettle partly uncovered. When 
it has boiled the given time, strain through a colander into a 
large bowl. Let it become partially cool, then skim all the fat 
from the surface, remove the broth from the bowl with a cup, 
leaving a little in the bottom of the bowl to avoid the dregs. 
Strain the second time through a wet cloth. Put two table- 
spoonfuls of butter and two of flour in a saucepan. After it 
has cooked for five minutes pour the broth over it, a cupful 
at a time. Stir constantly. Let it simmer twenty minutes. 
Remove the pan to the side of range and. pour in slowly, con- 
stantly stirring, one-half pint of rich cream. Do not boil after 
this is in. Place the partridge and rabbit fillets as follows : 
cover the bottom of a roasting pan with thin slices of larding 
pork. Season each one of the fillets with a little salt and pepper. 
Place them side by side in the pan and cover them with a thin 
layer of pork. Pour over them five tablespoonfuls of the game 
broth. Bake in hot oven for fifteen minutes. Baste twice dur- 
ing the cooking. Remove from the pan. Cut the rabbit fillets 
in very small squares, partridge fillets in thin square slices one- 
half inch wide. Serve the puree very hot after adding the 

minced fillets. 

Green Turtle Soup 

Green turtle when prepared can be kept for weeks, and 
dealers are not willing to retail it. The best way is to buy a 
small turtle weighing about twenty-five pounds. If your 
dealer will not prepare it, hang it by the hind legs or fins, cut 
off its head and let it bleed all day. Then with a sharp knife 
part the two shells, remove the intestines, take all the meat 
from the shells, bones, and fins. Cut each shell in four pieces, 
and plunge — for a moment only — the fins and shells in boiling 



86 MBS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

water to take the horny skin off. Then make a broth as fol- 
lows : Cut in pieces and put in a stock pot twenty pounds of 
lean soup beef, six gallons of water, and plenty of salt. Boil 
slowly and skim well ; add four onions, four carrots, four leeks, 
two heads of celery, a bunch of parsley, four bay leaves, thyme, 
sage, and basilic in proportion, and one handful of whole pep- 
pers, a few allspice, a few whole cloves, and a few blades of mace 
all tied together in a small cloth. Boil six hours and pass the 
broth through a sieve into a large tin pan. Use some of this 
broth diluted with water in a saucepan to cook the shells and 
fins, and some in another saucepan to cook the meat. The 
shells and fins require about one hour, and the meat not over 
twenty minutes. When they are done, take the shells, meat, and 
fins out of the broth and pass the broth through a fine strainer 
into another saucepan. Remove all the bones from the shells, 
fins, and meat, and cut in small square pieces. Mix the whole 
and put it in a dish. 

The above is the preliminary and essential preparation. 
For a soup for eight persons : Thicken three quarts of broth 
with four ounces of flour which has been browned in butter, 
boil one-half hour, and skim well. Add one-half pint of Sherry 
wine, one gill of Port wine, a dash of cayenne pepper, and a 
portion of the turtle. Boil ten minutes, skim again, and serve 
with slices of lemon. 

To preserve what is left of the turtle, reduce to a consist- 
ency the rest of the broth, add the turtle, and boil five minutes. 
Put in quart tin cans, which should not be quite filled. When 
cold, pour into each can, over the turtle, some melted lard to 
keep out the air. Set in a cool larder for further use. One 
quart is enough for eight persons. 

Stewed Oysters a la Baltimore 

Open neatly three dozen oysters. Place them in a sauce- 
pan without their liquor and add one ounce of good butter. 



soups 87 

Cover the pan and place it over the fire. Cook for two min- 
utes. Then add one wine-glass of good Madeira wine and a 
very little cayenne pepper. Cook together a little longer and 
then add one gill of Espagnole sauce and one-half a glass of 
demiglazed sauce. Stir thoroughly until it comes to a boil. 
Just before serving add the juice of one lemon, one teaspoonful 
of butter, one teaspoonful of finely chopped parsely. Serve im- 
mediately in a tureen. 

Oyster Bisque 

Two quarts of oysters in a saucepan with a little white pep- 
per, nutmeg, two blades of mace, one bay leaf, one pinch of red 
pepper, two ounces of butter, one pint of white broth. Cover, 
boil ten minutes, drain in a colander, and save the liquor. Then 
chop the oysters very fine and put them on a plate. Knead 
five ounces of flour in a saucepan with four ounces of melted 
butter. Stir and cook a little without allowing to brown. 
Then dilute with three pints of boiled milk and the oyster 
liquor. Add the oysters, stir steadily, and boil ten minutes. 
Rub through a very fine sieve and add more milk if required. 
Stir and boil again. Finish with one-half pint of raw cream 
and four ounces of butter in small bits. Taste, pour in soup 
tureen, and serve hot, with small squares of bread fried in butter 
separately on a plate. 

Clam Bisque 

Boil one quart of opened clams for twenty minutes in three 
pints of good veal consomme. Strain and add two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, two tablespoonfuls of blended flour, and one pint 
of cream. Cook for a few minutes. Then stir in the well- 
beaten yolks of four eggs. Cook a few minutes longer. Sea- 
son with salt and white pepper to taste. 

Olam Ohowder 
One quart of opened hard clams, drained and chopped very 
fine, two dozen soft-shell clams, chopped in the same way, with 



88 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

the hard part removed. Cut one quart of peeled potatoes in 
small squares. Bruise and steep one-half pound of hard crackers 
in cold water. Chop two large white onions and two ounces of 
salt pork very fine. Put the pork and onion in a stewpan with 
one ounce of butter. Fry until a light brown, add the potatoes, 
six peeled and sliced tomatoes, one quart of water, three pints 
of white broth, veal or chicken, ground thyme, mace, sage, and 
white pepper to taste. Boil thirty minutes. Then put in the 
clams with their liquor and the crackers. Boil thirty minutes 
longer. Skim the fat, add four ounces of butter and chopped 
parsley, mix thoroughly, and serve at once. 

Fish Broth 

Fry four ounces of butter with the following vegetables 
sliced fine : two onions, two carrots, and two leeks. Fry until 
quite dry. Then add four pounds of fish, — such as bass, black 
fish, flounder, or any bony fish, — the head of a fresh cod, one 
quart of white wine, and six quarts of water. Season with 
salt, peppercorns, bunch of parsley, and a few blades of mace. 
Cover the stewpan and boil one-half hour. Strain the broth 
and free it from its fat. Chop up two pounds of cod or bass, 
mix with two eggs, add the broth and a few more sliced vege- 
tables. Set on the fire and stir constantly until it begins to 
boil. Then let it simmer for ten minutes and strain through a 
wet cloth. Pour in a tureen with three or four dozen veal 
forcemeat balls fried in hot lard. 

Pish Chowder 

Skin a four-pound haddock, wash thoroughly, and cut the 
flesh from the bones in pieces about two inches square. Cover 
the head and bones with cold water and boil one-half hour. 
Slice two small white onions in a pan with four slices of thin, 
fat, salt pork. When tender, skim out the pork and onions and 
add the strained bone liquor and one quart of sliced raw potato. 



SOUPS 89 

Cook for ten minutes, then add the fish, one tablespoonful of 
salt, and one-half teaspoonful of white pepper. When the 
potatoes are tender, add one quart of hot milk which has been 
thickened with two ounces of butter and flour mixed together. 
Do not break the fish by needless stirring. Split six butter 
crackers, arrange in a tureen, and pour the fish chowder over 
them. 

Crab Bisque 

For eight persons use eighteen large, hard-shell crabs, one 
quart of chicken or veal stock, one quart of cream, one pint of 
stale bread free of crust, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one of 
flour, one small slice of carrot, one large slice of onion, two bay 
leaves, one stalk of celery, one sprig of parsley, a bit of mace, 
slight grating of nutmeg, one-fourth teaspoonful of white pep- 
per, dash of cayenne, and three teaspoonfuls of salt. Put one- 
half the meat of the crabs and all of the claws into a stewpan. 
Add the spice, vegetables, herbs, and half the stock, and place 
the pan where its contents will simmer gently for forty min- 
utes. Ten minutes later put the bread and the remaining 
stock into another stewpan, and set the pan where its contents 
will simmer gently for thirty minutes. When the first mix- 
ture has cooked for the proper period, strain it over that in the 
second stewpan. Mix all these ingredients thoroughly and rub 
through a fine sieve. Return to the fire and add butter and 
flour which have been rubbed together. Cook five minutes 
longer and add the cream heated in a double boiler, the re- 
mainder of the crab meat, salt and pepper. Let the soup boil 
up once and serve. If one choose, one tablespoonful of brandy 
and three of Sherry may be added after the bisque is taken 
from the stove. 

Crab Bisque 

Twelve large, hard-shell crabs boiled in salted water. The 
female crab, known by the light red claws and large flap, is the 



90 MRS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

best. Drain, remove the large shell, but save the creamy part 
that sticks to it. Put this with the coral that is in the crab, 
pound fine with four ounces of butter and the yolks of four eggs, 
and rub through a sieve. Pare off the flaps and gills, wash 
off the sand, and pound what is left of the crab to a puree. 
Chop a medium-sized onion, put it in a saucepan with four 
ounces of butter, fry a minute or two, then add one pound of 
steeped and pressed white of bread and the crab puree. Stir 
the whole to a paste and gradually stir in one-half pint Catawba 
wine and enough white broth to make it of the right consist- 
ency. Add a bouquet and boil all for one-half hour. Rub 
through a fine hair sieve, stir and boil again. Add the pre- 
pared egg yolks, white pepper and a pinch of cayenne, one-half 
pint boiling cream. Mix well without boiling and pour into a 
tureen. If possible, serve with small boiled oyster crabs sepa- 
rately on a plate. 

Gumbo of Crabs 

Take eight large, soft-shell crabs, clean them, and pare off 
the small legs, flaps, and gills which are spongy and generally 
sandy. Wash, drain well, and cut each crab in about eight 
pieces. Put in a saucepan two ounces butter, two chopped 
shallots, and two ounces of ham cut very small. Fry a little, 
add one-half pint of white wine, five pints of white broth, salt, 
pepper, one bunch of parsley tied up with one bay leaf, one sprig 
of thyme, one clove of garlic, two cloves, one-half a green pep- 
per without the seeds and cut small, and finally the crabs. 
Cover, and boil slowly for one hour. Remove the parsley, 
skim the fat, and add six tablespoonfuls of gumbo powder. 
Drop the powder by the left hand quite a distance from the 
liquid, all the time stirring with the right hand. This pre- 
vents it from getting lumpy. Season highly, pour into a 
soup tureen, and serve with plain boiled rice on a separate 
dish. 



soups 91 

Lobster Bisque 

Cover two lobsters weighing about one and one-half pounds 
each with boiling water. Add one tablespoonful of salt, one 
head of celery, one small bouquet, half an onion, and six whole 
peppers. Cook until the lobsters' claws can easily be pulled 
apart — it will probably take twenty minutes. When cool 
enough to handle, cut the lobster down the back and remove 
the meat from the body and the claws. Save the coral and the 
green fat. Put back all the tough part with the small claws 
and shells, and cook them for twenty minutes in the same 
liquor. The liquor must be considerably reduced. Dry the 
coral, then rub it through a sieve. In a saucepan mix one table- 
spoonful of butter with one ounce of flour. When it comes to 
a boil, stir in one quart of hot milk. Let this come to a boil. 
Then add one pint of the lobster broth. This must come to a 
boil. Then season with salt and white pepper. Stir in the 
sifted coral enough to give the liquid a bright pink color. 
Place the green fat and the lobster meat cut in fine pieces in a 
tureen, pour the hot mixture over them, and serve very hot. 

Sudden Call Soup 

While one quart of milk is heating in a double boiler, place 
a tablespoon of butter in a stewpan till it boils, — but does not 
brown, — add two tablespoons of flour, and when that is well 
mixed in, one teaspoon each of salt and celery salt, and a salt- 
spoon of white pepper. Add this hot thickening to the milk. 
Take a small can of salmon, remove the bone and skim, mince 
fine, and add to the heated and thickened milk. Boil up and 
serve at once. 

Pure'e of Asparagus 

Have at hand two bunches of asparagus, three ounces of 
flour, three ounces of butter, two scant quarts of white broth, 
one quart of milk and seasoning. Break the asparagus tops off 



92 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

as far down as possible. Wash them and then boil in salted 
water. Drain immediately. Melt three ounces of butter in a 
stewpan, stir over a brisk fire for five minutes, add three ounces 
of flour, mix thoroughly, and then add two quarts of white 
broth and a quart of boiled milk, salt, white pepper, a dash of 
grated nutmeg, and a half teaspoonful of sugar. Stir constantly 
and let the mixture boil for ten minutes. Rub through a puree 
sieve. Pour in saucepan and let it come to a boil. If too 
thick, add more milk ; stir in a little butter. Serve with squares 
of fried bread in separate dish. 

Asparagus Soup 

Boil one quart of asparagus cut in inch lengths in one quart 
of water till tender. Rub through a colander and return it 
to the water in which it was boiled. Heat one pint of milk 
and pour it over one tablespoon of butter and one of flour 
well beaten together. Boil and then add to the asparagus. 
Pour in a tureen in which croutons have been placed, and 
serve. 

Puree of Barley- 
Boil for an hour barley with broth enough to cover it. 
When it is quite softened, put the barley through a sieve, thin 
with broth or stock, season with salt and pepper, and serve hot 
with toast sippets or croutons. 

For this chicken broth may be used, or a broth or stock of 
mutton or beef. 

Cream of Barley 

Boil slowly for four or five hours half a pint of barley, with 
an onion in a quart and a half of chicken broth. Put through 
a puree sieve, add a pint of cream or rich milk, boil up, set 
back on the range, add the beaten yolks of four eggs thinned 
with a little milk, and serve with croutons. 



soups 93 

Barley Soup 

Boil in water for half an hour half a pound of pearl barley. 
Place this barley in two quarts of chicken, beef, or mutton 
broth, add half a pint of dice made from turnip, carrots, and 
other vegetables, and boil gently for an hour or two. Season 
with salt and pepper, and when you serve, add a few green peas 
or a little sliced celery. 

Cream of Pearl Barley 

After washing half a pound of pearl barley most thoroughly, 
set it to cook in a quart of veal stock, and let it cook slowly at 
the back of the range for four or five hours. Divide the cooked 
barley in half, put one-half through a puree sieve and add to 
the other uncrushed half. Stir in a pint of boiling cream, sea- 
son to taste, and serve with sippets or croutons. 

Bean Soup 

Boil one pint of small white beans in one quart of water 
and one teaspoon of soda for five minutes. Pour off the boil- 
ing water and put the beans through cold water till the skins 
come off. Throw away the skins. Put the beans again in 
fresh cold water and boil till very soft. Add two quarts of 
rich milk, salt, pepper, and butter to taste ; afterward let the 
soup boil up a couple of times before serving. The soft part of 
the bean is of course broken up in the boiling and forms the 
thickening and gives the flavor to the soup. 

Black Bean Soup 

Take three pints of black beans and soak them over night. 
Put them to boil early in the morning with two pounds of beef, 
one grated carrot, two onions, and six quarts of water. Boil 
until the beans are soft. Then put in twelve whole cloves. 
Strain through a fine sieve, being careful to get all the pulp 
through. Heat the mixture thoroughly, and add the juice of 



94 MRS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

two lemons, three hard-boiled eggs cut in slices, one lemon cut 
in slices, a dash of red pepper, and Sherry wine to taste. Serve 
very hot. After straining, should the soup be too thick, add a 
little boiling water. 

Puree of Lima Beans 

Place one quart of Lima beans in a saucepan with salted 
boiling water, one onion with a clove stuck in it, a small piece 
of carrot, a bouquet, and one ounce of butter. Boil briskly 
until soft, drain in a colander, and save the liquid. Remove 
the onion, carrot, and bouquet, and pound the beans in a mor- 
tar, then mix with the liquid and enough white broth to make 
the desired quantity of soup. Rub through a puree sieve. 
Stir it over the fire until it comes to a boil, skim, and season to 
taste. Add two ounces of butter. When thoroughly mixed, 
serve with small pieces of fried bread. 

Beet Soup, or Barszcz 

Make a strong bouillon by stewing marrow bones and soup 
meats. Cook beets until they are delicate and tender, then 
slice them to make circles, and cut the circles in little fingers. 

This soap is often prescribed in Europe as extremely nour- 
ishing and strengthening. 

Cauliflower Soup 

Have one quart of clear white broth, free from grease, and 
one tablespoonful of finely chopped onion. Let them come to 
a boil. Rub one cupful of boiled cauliflower through a sieve, 
and add to the broth. Let one pint of milk come to a boil 
and stir that in. Season with salt and white pepper. If not 
thick and creamy, add a little flour blended with water. Then 
add one tablespoonful of butter, and one cupful of cooked 
cauliflower, in little branches. Stir in a tablespoonful of finely 
chopped parsley and serve very hot. 



soups 95 

Chestnut Soup 

Boil two pounds of French chestnuts until they are tender. 
Remove the shells and peel them. Set aside twelve whole 
ones. The rest must be put into a mortar, pounded, and then 
rubbed through a sieve. Mix this puree with enough con- 
somme and cream — half of each ingredient — to make a rich 
cream soup. Season with salt and a little white pepper. Stir 
over the fire and scald thoroughly, but do not let it boil. Just 
before serving, cut the twelve chestnuts up in small pieces — 
each chestnut in five pieces — and stir in the soup. Serve 
very hot. 

Corn Soup 

Cook in a double boiler with three cups of milk for fifteen 
minutes the pulp cut and scraped from six ears of fresh corn. 
Cook the cobs in one-half pint of water. Stir one cup of 
cream sauce into the milk and pulp. Rub the pulp, etc., 
through the strainer, diluting it with the cob water. Heat 
again and season with paprika. If too thick, add more milk. 

. Cucumber Soup 

Take six good-sized cucumbers, peel them and remove all 
the seeds, cut them in small pieces, and fry in melted butter 
until tender. Then rub them through a puree sieve. Place in 
a saucepan two quarts of white broth and the cucumber puree. 
Heat thoroughly and add one-half pint cream mixed with the 
yolks of four eggs. Stir over the fire until it becomes the 
desired consistency. Do not let it boil. 

Egg Soup 

Fry three sliced onions in a little butter until they are a 
light brown. Then pour in three pints of water and boil 
without a cover until the onions are tender. Remove the 
onions, which you may put through a sieve, and return to the 



96 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

pot or leave out altogether. To the boiling liquid add a tea- 
spoon of salt, a little pepper and sugar, and a teacup of milk, 
into which you have beaten smooth a tablespoon of flour. 
After the soup has thickened, take off the fire and add slowly, 
and one at a time, the yolks of four eggs. Pour over dice of 
bread fried, or merely plain toast, and send to the table hot. 

Mushroom Soup 

Have at hand two pounds of good-sized fresh mushrooms. 
Select twelve of them and set aside. Chop the rest and fry in 
melted butter. You can tell when they are done, for then the 
butter will be oily. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour. When 
thoroughly mixed, add one pint of milk, and one pint of cream, 
and one cup of consomme. Cook slowly for fifteen minutes. 
Rub the soup through a colander, then strain through a cheese 
cloth. Season with salt and white pepper. Heat thoroughly, 
and serve. 

Cream of Celery 

Cut twelve stalks of celery in small pieces, and boil with 
half an onion and a blade of mace in three pints of water for 
half an hour. Put through a puree sieve, add a pint of milk, 
salt and pepper to taste, and a heaping tablespoon of butter 
mixed with a tablespoon of flour. Bring the mixture to a boil, 
add a cup of cream, and serve at once. 

,™ — i Cream of Cheese 

Bring to a boiling-point two cups of milk, two cups of 
white stock, and one onion. Take out the onion and thicken 
the liquid with one tablespoon of butter and flour rubbed 
together till smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste, stir in a 
full half cup of grated cheese, add an egg beaten light, and 
serve at once. A small pinch of soda in the milk before the 
cheese is added may prevent any separation, 



soups 97 

Cream of Corn 

Add a quart and a half of water to each quart of corn, cut 
fresh from the cob, or if that cannot be had, to each quart of 
canned corn. Boil until the kernels are tender and then add 
two ounces of butter which has been beaten into one tablespoon 
of flour. Add fifteen or twenty more minutes to the boiling, 
season to taste, stir in a cup of cream, either plain or whipped, 
as preferred, and serve with floating croutons. 

Cream of Onion 

Peel and slice a dozen small white onions and fry them a 
light brown in a tablespoon of butter. Have ready in a double 
boiler a pint of water, a quart of milk, a saltspoon of salt and 
white pepper, a pinch of mace, and a double pinch of sugar. To 
this add the fried onions, cook slowly half an hour, and strain 
through a puree sieve. Add the yolks of three well-beaten eggs 
and a cupful of cream and serve at once. 

Potato Cream Soup 

Peel and boil six large potatoes. Mash them through a 
colander, add one quart of milk and one pint of cream, salt and 
white pepper to taste, and a piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Strain through a fine sieve. Pour into the tureen and sprinkle 
with very fine chopped parsley. Slice bread about half an inch 
thick, cut in strips about half an inch wide and three inches 
long. Arrange in frying basket, plunge in hot fat, and fry until 
light brown. Drain on brown paper, arrange on separate dish, 
and serve with the above. 

Cream of Eioe 

Wash and parboil one pound of rice. Drain and cook 
thoroughly with two quarts of chicken or veal broth, then rub 
it through a puree sieve. Dilute with more broth, if necessary, 



98 MBS. SEELY'S COOS BOOK 

until it is the desired consistency. Stir over the fire until it 
comes to a boil, skim, and season to taste. Just before serving, 
stir in one pint of boiling cream and two ounces of butter. 
Mix thoroughly. Add one pint of small green asparagus tops 
and serve. 

Cream of Spinach 

Wash and boil half a peck of spinach in salted water. Drain 
and chop very fine. Put in a stewpan with two ounces of butter, 
salt, pepper, and a little grated nutmeg. Stir over the fire until 
the moisture is almost evaporated, stir in one ounce and a half 
of flour and three pints of boiled milk. When the mixture has 
boiled for a minute, remove from the fire, rub it twice through 
a fine sieve, and return to the pan. Stir and heat it well without 
boiling it. Add a little more butter and half a cup of cream. 
Serve with fried bread crumbs. 

Oatmeal Soup 

Boil together for an hour and a half enough oatmeal to make 
the water slightly thick or viscid. Add a lump of butter, 
enough sugar to sweeten slightly, a little wine, and drop in a bit 
of lemon peel. A good pinch of salt also should not be for- 
gotten. After the boiling strain through a sieve, boil up again, 
add cream and the beaten yolks of eggs to your taste, and serve 
with toast sippets. 

, — -''Split Pea Soup 

In buying dried or split peas, be sure that they are not old 
and worm-eaten. Wash a pint of them clean and soak them 
over night in plenty of cold water. Put them on to boil with 
five pints of cold water and boil them till tender. Add, when 
the peas are tender, a couple of onions, or more if you wish, a 
couple of fine carrots grated, and a turnip or two sliced, if 
your taste so directs. These vegetables should be browned 
in butter before going to the peas. Add also pepper and salt 



soups 99 

to taste. Stew all gently together till the vegetables will go 
through a sieve. After straining in this way put the soup 
back to boil and serve after a few minutes' boiling with half 
a dozen croutons floating in each plate. The hock of a ham 
or a piece of pork may be cooked with the peas for flavoring. 

Saratoga Soup 

Warm and strain one can of tomatoes, add half a cup of raw 
sago. Boil until the sago is clear. Add one pint of consomme. 
Salt and pepper to taste. If desired, a little Worcestershire may 
be added. 

Tomato Soup 

Heat and strain one can of tomatoes and add one quart of 
stock. Stir in one teaspoonful of corn-starch which has been 
blended in a little water. Stir constantly over the fire until 
just ready to boil. Season with salt, a little Worcestershire, 
and also a little mushroom catsup. 

Tomato Oream Soup 

Melt one good-sized lump of butter, stir in two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour. When mixed, add one pint of milk and one pint 
of cream. Let it boil. Scald one can of tomatoes, strain, and 
add to the soup a little at a time so it will not curdle the milk 
and cream. Add a very small pinch of sugar, season to taste. 
Strain through a wet cheese-cloth and serve very hot. 

Tomato Soup 

Empty one quart jar of tomatoes into an agate saucepan 
and add one pint of cold water. Stand the mixture over a 
quick fire. Next, mix together in another saucepan one heap- 
ing tablespoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour. 
When the tomatoes reach the boiling heat, pour them over the 
flour and butter in the other saucepan, stirring constantly to 



100 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

keep it from lumping. Set the saucepan on the stove and 
season the mixture with a little grated onion, one heaping tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a little black pepper. Let the soup boil 
very slowly for half an hour. Then press it through a puree 
sieve. Stand it back on the fire, add one teaspoonful of soda, 
and after a minute add one pint of rich cream. Let it boil one 
minute and then serve. 

Tomato Soup Maigre 

Fry to a good brown a sliced onion, — this in the bottom of 
a soup pot, — and over it pour a can of tomatoes, which have 
been well chopped, and two cups of boiling water. When the 
tomatoes are cooked tender, rub them through a colander, put 
the soup in the kettle, add a cup of boiled rice, thicken with a 
tablespoon of butter, rubbed smooth with the same amount of 
flour, boil up, and serve. 

Sorrel Soup 

Make a good strong bouillon, using marrow bones and bone 
meat preferably. Having carefully washed the sorrel leaves, 
chop them very fine, and cook till tender in a little of the 
bouillon. Add to them rich cream in the proportion of a 
tablespoon or two for each plate, bring to a boil, pour into the 
bouillon, and serve. 

Sometimes hard-boiled eggs are served with this soup. The 
eggs are cut in halves, fried in butter, and two halves laid in 
each soup plate. 



CHAPTER V 

FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 
> Court Bouillon for all Sorts of Fresh Water Fish 

One pint of water, one quart of white wine, one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, a bunch of parsley, a few young onions, one clove 
of garlic, a bunch of thyme, one bay leaf, one carrot, and a 
blade of mace. Boil the fish in this bouillon, which will do 
for use several times. Any kind of fish, such as salmon, trout, 
pompano, sheepshead, carp, may be boiled in this way. Lob- 
ster boiled in court bouillon is very fine. 

Fish Forcemeat 

Take one pound of raw fish, — halibut, cod, pompano. 
Mortar it well and put it through a puree sieve. Weigh it ; 
there should be four ounces, good weight. Then add the beaten 
white of one egg. Set in a cool place. Melt one tablespoon- 
ful of butter with one of flour. When they come to a boil, 
add one cup milk, the yolk of one egg, one tablespoonful 
cream. Season to taste. Cook until it thickens and is smooth, 
remove, and when cold add to your fish. 

Fish Forcemeat 

Take two ounces of fish free from skin, put in a mortar 
with two ounces of fresh butter, one ounce of bread crumbs, 
the yolks of two eggs boiled hard, and a little shallot, grated 
lemon peel, and minced parsley. Pound together till quite 
smooth, mix with salt, pepper, and the yolk and white of an 
egg, and it is ready for use.

Veal Forcemeat for Fish 

Soak four ounces of stale bread in water, squeeze it dry, 
and mix with four ounces of finely chopped cooked veal and 
two ounces of finely chopped salt pork and one tablespoonful 
of butter. Pound all in a mortar, then rub through a puree 
sieve, and add the following : the juice of half a lemon, half 
a teaspoonful of powdered thyme, half a teaspoonful of sweet 
marjoram, a little ground mace, a little salt and white pepper, 
and a well-beaten egg. This may be made in larger or smaller 
quantities, according to the size and number of the fish to be 
stuffed. 

Baked Bass 

"Wash and clean a fresh bass for baking, leaving on the 
head. Stuff the fish with the following mixture: two and 
one-half cups of fine bread crumbs, one cup of butter, the rind 
of a quarter of a lemon chopped very fine, two or three sprigs 
of parsley chopped fine, and a little sweet marjoram. Season 
to taste with salt and white pepper. Mix two well-beaten 
eggs with a little water, and add to the mixture. When the 
fish is well stuffed, sew up the opening. Score it on each side, 
and in the spaces place very thin slices of salt pork. Place it 
in a pan with a little stock, and bake in a moderate oven. 
Baste it frequently with the stock and a little seasoning. 
When thoroughly cooked, carefully place it on a hot dish. 

To the gravy which is left in the pan, add a little tomato 
sauce. Stir on the top of the range until it comes to a boil. 
Strain and serve in a separate dish. Garnish the fish plate with 
parsley and thin slices of lemon. 

Palmettes of Striped Bass 

Cut out six heart-shaped fillets from the thickest part of the 
bass. Season with pepper, salt, and the juice of half a lemon. 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 103 

Put under a press for one-half hour. Cook in clarified butter 
for ten minutes until a delicate brown. Make a forcemeat (the 
same as for fillet of pompano). Color the forcemeat pink and 
green, also have some white. Pour in three pastry bags. On 
the outside of each palmette put a pink border, on the inside 
all white with a small heart shape of green on the top. Set 
them away to get chilled. Have six pieces of heart-shaped oiled 
paper. Wrap up each palmette in one. Place them in a tin 
pan, set the pan over another which is half filled with water. 
Cook in the oven until the forcemeat is done, or from twenty 
to twenty-five minutes. Serve on corn-starch croustade and 
with Hollandaise sauce. 

Corn-starch Croustade 

Place one pint of milk in a saucepan over the fire, and when 
it boils add two heaping tablespoons of corn-starch, which has 
been dissolved in a little cold water, and one-half teaspoonful 
salt. When the mixture has cooked five minutes, add the white 
of an egg. Wet a mould about three-fourths or one inch deep 
of the desired shape and pour in the mixture. While hot it 
may be colored pink or green. Set away to cool. 

Baked Bluensh 

Select a nice large bluefish, clean, and prepare it for baking. 
Wash it in salted water, and after drying it thoroughly, stuff 
it with veal forcemeat for fish, or else with bread forcemeat, to 
which a few capers have been added. Sew up the opening and 
rub the fish all over with salt. Then, having put small pieces 
of butter over it, place it in a large pan with enough water to 
cover the bottom, and bake in a hot oven for forty-five or fifty 
minutes. After it begins to bake, sprinkle it with a little salt 
and pepper. Baste it often with the liquid in the pan and a 
little melted butter. When it is cooked and a nice color, remove 



104 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

carefully to a hot plate. Do not break it. Serve with a brown 
sauce, or any desired sauce poured round the fish as a garnish, 
or serve it in a separate dish. 

Slices of Cod a la Seville 

Wash and dry one-half pound of Carolina rice, fry it in hot 
olive oil, drain on a sieve, and then put it in a stewpan with 
some pieces of fresh cod cut in pieces about four inches square, 
and which have been fried in olive oil and drained. Cut a 
Spanish onion in very thin slices, and also fry the slices in oil. 
Mix them with six ripe tomatoes from which the skins and seeds 
have been removed. Cook the onion and tomato slowly for five 
minutes, then pour it over the fish and rice. Season with a 
little cayenne, salt, and lemon juice. Moisten with one pint of 
white broth, place a buttered paper on top, cover with the lid 
of the pan, and place in the oven to bake. In about half an 
hour the fish and rice will be done. Remove the pieces of fish 
and with a wooden spoon stir the rice over the fire in order to 
mix it with the seasoning. Arrange the rice on a dish and 
place the pieces of codfish on it. Garnish with tomato sauce 
or mussel sauce. 

.. , Shredded Cod baked with Cream Sauce 

Boil four or five pounds of fresh cod. "When cooked, drain 
and shred in fine pieces and set away to cool. Make the fol- 
lowing sauce for a five-pound piece of fish. Boil one quart of 
milk with one onion and a little finely chopped parsley. Set it 
aside. Mix one cup of butter with enough flour to absorb it. 
Add this to the milk and boil until it is the consistency of 
custard. Season with a dash of cayenne and salt to taste. Put 
a layer of shredded fish in a baking dish, cover with a layer of 
sauce, then a layer of fish, and so on until the dish is filled. 
Have the last layer of cream. Cover with fine bread crumbs. 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 105 

Sprinkle with pieces of butter and bake in the oven until the 
top is a nice brown. Small boiled potato balls covered with 
cream sauce should be served with this. 



Baked Cod 

Select a fresh cod, cut off the head and fins, draw, wash, and 
split it down the belly. Remove the bone from the thick part 
only, and make small lengthwise incisions in the skin in order 
to prevent the fish from curling while it is cooking. Put it to 
soak for three hours in a dressing made as follows : salt, white 
pepper, a little Worcestershire sauce, and some sweet oil. Drain 
and place in a pan. Baste it with melted butter and sprinkle 
with fine bread crumbs. Moisten with two glasses of white 
wine and one pint of oyster liquor. Bake in a slow oven and 
then cover with a buttered paper and bake a light brown in a 
moderate oven. Drain and thicken the liquid with a little flour 
kneaded with butter, add some lemon juice and finely chopped 
parsley. Pour this round the fish and serve. 

Baked Cod's Head 

Wash and thoroughly clean a cod's head. Stuff the gills 
with veal forcemeat. Place the head in a pan, season with salt, 
white pepper, and a little chopped parsley. Mix one pint of 
stock, a scant pint of Sherry wine, and a little tomato catsup, 
and pour into the pan. Cover the fish with buttered paper and 
bake in a moderate oven. The fish must be well basted while 
it is cooking. When the head is nearly cooked, sprinkle it with 
fine bread crumbs. The average sized head should bake in one 
hour and a quarter. Mix the liquor in the pan with two gills 
of brown sauce, strain it, and add two ounces of butter and a 
little lemon juice. Boil for four minutes and then pour over 
the fish or serve in separate dish. 



106 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Codfish a la Mode 

Take one teacup of salt codfish picked up fine, two teacups 
of mashed potatoes, one pint of cream or milk. Mix them well 
together and then add two eggs well beaten. Stir them in 
thoroughly and then add a half cup of butter, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Put in a baking dish and bake twenty or 
thirty minutes. 

Colonial Codfish Pie, with Crust 

Line a deep baking dish with a biscuit crust. To make the 
crust, sift together four cups of flour, one heaping teaspoon of 
soda, and two teaspoons of cream of tartar (or in place of these 
three heaping teaspoons of baking powder), and one teaspoon of 
salt. In this rub one-half a cup of shortening and about a pint 
of milk, that is, enough to make a medium soft dough. In rolling 
out the upper crust spread butter on twice and fold and roll out. 

Take a pint of picked-up salt codfish, cover it with boiling 
water, let it stand two minutes and drain. Pour on more water 
and, after it has stood, drain dry. Upon the crust of your bak- 
ing dish put a layer of this codfish, sprinkle it with bread 
crumbs, pepper (a little salt if you find the fish fresh), small 
pieces of butter, and some cream sauce (made by thickening one 
pint of boiling milk with two teaspoons of flour and seasoning 
with salt and pepper). Break over the fish bread crumbs and 
seasoning, three or four eggs, carefully preserving the yolks. 
Repeat these layers, — codfish, bread crumbs, cream sauce, and 
eggs, — put on the top crust, cut a few holes in the centre to let 
out the steam, and bake till the crust is a delicate brown. 

Codfish Balls 

Trim and soak a piece of salt codfish in cold water for six 
or seven hours, and during that time change the water two or 
three times. Shred it. Should it be too salt after shredding, 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTEBS, TERBAPIN 107 

freshen it by frequent changes of cold water. There should be 
one quart bowl of the shredded fish. Cover it with water and let 
it simmer gently until tender. It will not take very long. 
Should you boil it too much, you might harden it. Have ready 
six good-sized, fresh-boiled potatoes, and mash them while hot. 
Have the fish drained, pounded, and rubbed through a sieve, 
and mix with the potatoes and three well-beaten eggs. Season 
to taste with salt — if necessary — and white pepper, also a 
small lump of butter. Drop by the tablespoonful into a pan of 
boiling hot lard and fry until a delicate brown. Drain on 
brown paper and serve very hot. 

Maigre Pish Pie 

Have ready plenty of salt codfish boiled and free from bones 
and skin. Have ready also four hard-boiled eggs and four 
onions. Peal and slice the eggs and onions very thin. Line the 
bottom of a deep pie dish with fish forcemeat or a layer of boiled 
potatoes sliced thin. On this put a layer of onions, then a 
layer of fish, then of eggs, and so on till the dish is full. Season 
each layer with a little pepper, and pour over the layers a gill 
of water containing a teaspoon of made mustard, a teaspoon of 
the essence of anchovy, and a little mushroom catsup. Break 
in small bits over the top an ounce of fresh butter. Cover all 
with a puff paste and bake one hour. For this dish fresh fish 
may be used by adding a little salt. 

Salt Mackerel 

Soak salt mackerel about forty-eight hours, changing the 
water once, then put it in a pan, cover with cream or the richest 
milk. Put in the oven and cook until cream is brown. 

Pompano Fillets a la Duchesse 

Cut fillets — as many as you wish — from a nice pompano. 
Put them on a platter and season with half a teaspoon of salt, 



108 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

one-fourth a teaspoon of pepper, and the juice of half an onion. 
Rub the fish well with the pepper and salt. Squeeze the onion 
juice over the fillets through a fine cloth, and let them stand 
one hour. Wipe dry. Put some fish forcemeat in a tube, and 
in fanciful forms press it over the fillets. Put a star cut from 
a truffle on top of each. Wrap each in piece of oiled paper. 
Place them in a tin pan, set the pan over another which is 
half filled with water. Bake in the oven until the forcemeat 
is done, or from twenty to twenty-five minutes. Serve with 
duchesse sauce. 

Stuffed Pompano with Lobster 

Select a fresh pompano, clean and wash it, and having re- 
moved the head and tail, reserve them for future use. Split 
the fish as for broiling and remove the bone. Boil a small 
lobster weighing about one and a half pounds. When cool 
remove the meat, saving the coral. Pound the meat in a mor- 
tar and rub it through a puree sieve. Mix it with a small cup 
of cream sauce, two well-beaten eggs, one tablespoonful of 
flour. Season with salt, white pepper, and if desired a dash 
of nutmeg. Lastly, stir in a small cup of cream and a table- 
spoonful of Sherry. Mix thoroughly. Lay the split pompano 
in a pan, skin side down, and on each half smoothly spread the 
lobster forcemeat. Garnish the fish with truffles cut in fancy 
shapes, finely chopped truffles, hard-boiled eggs, — the whites 
and yolks chopped separately, — and the coral of the lobster 
cut in strips. Pour a little salted water in the pan, cover the 
fish with buttered paper, and steam in hot oven for half an 
hour. When done, place on a hot dish on a bed of green 
celery cut in strips like grass. Decorate the head and tail 
and replace on fish. Put a few shrimps around the dish, on the 
celery, and serve with a shrimp sauce. Bass may be served in 
this way. The fish, when prettily garnished, is very pleasing 
at serving time.

Boiled Red Snapper 

Clean and scale a fresh red snapper which will weigh about 
five or six pounds. Wash it in cold water. Have as much 
water in the kettle as will cover your fish. Add vinegar, salt, 
and lemon juice. To four quarts of water add one and a half 
tablespoons of lemon juice, two tablespoons of salt, and one 
tablespoon of vinegar. When the water comes to a boil, push 
it to the back of the range. Add a pint of cold water, then 
put your fish in and move the kettle to the front. Just as 
soon as the water comes to a boil, place the kettle where the 
contents will just bubble. Let it cook in this way for half an 
hour. When cooked, drain thoroughly and serve with Hollan- 
daise or any sauce suitable for the fish. 

Baked Red Snapper, with Forcemeat 

Select a red snapper weighing about five pounds. Cut off 
the fins, scale it, and prepare it for baking. Stuff it with the 
following mixture : One pint of medium-sized oysters, chopped 
very fine, one-half cup of powdered cracker crumbs, one gener- 
ous tablespoonful of butter, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of 
white pepper, one-half teaspoonful of onion juice, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and one teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley. Mix 
together thoroughly. Rub the fish inside and out with one 
tablespoonful of salt. When it is stuffed, sew up the opening 
and place it on a buttered sheet of tin. Place the tin in a pan 
with about a pint of boiling water and bake in hot oven for 
about one hour. 

Have the following sauce prepared to baste the fish with : 
Heat two tablespoon Ms of butter, then add two tablespoonfuls 
of flour. Stir until it is brown. Then gradually add one pint 
of cold water. Let this boil for five minutes and keep it hot. 
Pour about one-quarter of this sauce over the fish. Dredge 
it with salt, pepper, and a little flour. Repeat this in ten 



110 mrs. seelt's coos: book 

minutes, and twice after with an interval of fifteen minutes. 
Renew the water in the pan each time the fish is basted. Serve 
with a Madeira sauce or any simple sauce. 

Broiled Salmon 

Select as many slices of salmon as required. Sprinkle with 
a little chopped parsley and mixed herbs, salt and pepper, and 
some olive oil. Let the slices soak for one hour, turning occa- 
sionally so the fish will absorb the seasoning. Arrange on a 
well-greased gridiron and broil over a clear fire. Baste occa- 
sionally with the oil seasoning which is left. When nicely 
browned and thoroughly cooked, place on a hot dish, and 
garnish with parsley and slices of lemon. Serve a white sauce 
in a separate dish. 

Salmon Cutlets 

Cut two or three pounds of cold boiled salmon in very 
small pieces. Mix some boiled lobster coral and half an 
ounce of butter, pound in a mortar, and rub through a hair 
sieve. Place one gill of milk in a saucepan with one ounce 
of butter and one ounce of flour which have been creamed 
together. Stir over the fire until it becomes thick and does 
not stick to the sides of the pan. Then stir in the salmon, 
coral, a dash of cayenne pepper, salt, and lemon juice to taste. 
Remove from the fire. When cold, shape the mixture into 
cutlets, brush them with beaten egg, roll in fine bread crumbs, 
and fry until a nice brown in hot fat. Drain on hot paper. 
Serve on a hot dish garnished with fried parsley. Serve lobster 
sauce separately. 

Baked Salmon 

Take four salmon steaks weighing one pound each. Place 
in a buttered saucepan with one pint white wine, one pint 
white broth, white pepper, salt, a little grated nutmeg, a bunch 
of parsley with a few whole spices or herbs wrapped in it, and 




FISH MOUSSE. 




Facing page 110. 



MOULD FOR A MOUSSE OF FISH. 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 111 

two ounces of butter. Let it come to a boil, then cover and 
simmer for one-half hour. Drain the fish and remove the 
bunch of parsley. Thicken the liquid with one ounce of flour 
which has been cooked in butter. Boil ten minutes, then mix 
with the yolks of four eggs and some chopped parsley. Spread 
a thin layer of thick mashed potatoes in an oval baking dish, 
well buttered. Remove the bone and skin from the steaks and 
place them one overlapping the other on the potatoes. Fill 
with more potatoes, smooth nicely, and pour the sauce over all. 
Sprinkle with bread crumbs and little pieces of butter over 
the top. Bake until a light brown, in a moderate oven, about 
twenty minutes. Serve in the baking dish. 

Fillets of Salmon a la "Venitienne 

Take the fillets from a four-pound tail-piece of salmon. 
Remove the skin and cut each one in four long pieces. Flatten 
and trim evenly. Fasten fine strips of larding pork on one 
side, season with salt, white pepper, and a little lemon juice, 
and place the larded side up in a buttered pan. Moisten with 
half a pint of white wine, and cover with a sheet of buttered 
paper with a small hole in the centre. The steam must have 
vent, else the surface will not glaze. Cook in the oven about 
forty minutes, basting frequently with the liquid in order to 
have the glaze a nice color. Drain and dish the fillets in a 
circle with alternate heart-shaped slices of bread fried in but- 
ter. Thicken two ladlefuls of broth with one ounce of flour 
kneaded in butter. Stir and boil a few minutes. Add two 
ounces of butter, a little lemon juice, and chopped parsley. 
Mix well and pour in centre of dish. 

„^— Salmon Mousse a la Martinot 

Have a slice of raw salmon, scrape so it will be free from 
sinews, put it in a mortar and pound to a pulp, and put through 
a fine puree sieve. Then weigh it. There should be eight 



112 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

ounces, good weight. Place in a bowl and gradually add the 
beaten white of two eggs, stirring constantly with a wooden 
pestle. Make a sauce of the following: One tablespoonful 
melted butter, one tablespoonful flour. Let them come to a 
boil. Add one cupful milk, two tablespoonfuls of mushroom 
liquor, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of 
white pepper, a pinch of cayenne, and juice of one onion. 
Cook all together five minutes, add the yolks of three eggs and 
two tablespoons of cream. Do not let the sauce boil after the 
yolks have been added. When the sauce commences to thicken, 
remove and set away to cool. When cold, add it to the fish. 
Rub all well together and put on ice for half an hour. Then 
add half a pint of whipped cream. Butter your mould, decorate 
it with truffles. Put on ice to harden, so the decoration will 
be firm on mould. Fill the mould with fish, giving it a few 
knocks on the table to settle the forcemeat. Thirty minutes 
before serving put your mould in a pan, pour hot water halfway 
to mould, put a buttered paper on top, and poach in a moderate 
oven until firm to the touch. When ready to serve, dip your 
mould in cold water, lay the dish you are going to serve it in 
on top of mould. Turn very gently and lift off the mould. 
Serve with Martinot sauce in centre or in sauce-boat. 

Baked Salmon Trout 

Carefully clean, wash, and thoroughly dry a fresh salmon 
trout. Spread it full length, head and tail included, in a bak- 
ing pan, with just enough water to keep it from scorching. If 
a very large one, score the backbone, but be careful not to mar 
the sides. Bake very slowly in a moderate oven, basting often 
with butter and water. When it is done, remove to a hot dish. 
Have ready in a saucepan a cup of cream diluted with a few 
spoonfuls of hot water, and mix carefully with two tablespoons 
of melted butter and a little finely chopped parsley. Heat this 
in a pan with boiling water underneath it. Add the gravy 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 113 

from the pan the fish was cooked in. Boil up once to thicken. 
Pour this sauce around the trout or serve in a separate dish. 
Garnish the fish with sprigs of parsley. The fish should have 
almost the same colored spots as when uncooked. If necessary, 
season with a little salt. 

Broiled Shad a, l'Abbe with Herb Sauce 

Get one large roe shad and an extra shad roe. Prepare the 
fish for broiling, taking the roe and keeping it with the other 
until wanted. Remove the bone of the fish, clean nicely, wash 
and wipe dry. Make small incisions on both sides of the fish 
and soak it for one hour in a dish with salt, pepper, olive 
oil, and lemon juice. See that it soaks on both sides. Drain, 
sprinkle with bread crumbs, and broil slowly for one-half hour. 
See that your broiler is well greased. Make eight pieces out 
of your roes and also have eight large oysters. Dip them in 
beaten egg and roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot fat until a 
nice brown. Dish up the shad, surround with roes and oysters, 
and serve with an herb sauce. 

Herb Sauce 

Place two chopped shallots in a saucepan with a little but- 
ter, salt, white pepper, grated nutmeg, and a glass of white 
wine. Boil until it is reduced one-half. Add half a pint of 
veloute sauce and boil a minute. Thicken with three egg 
yolks and as much water as you have egg yolks, mix water 
and yolks together, and stir without boiling. Then add care- 
fully four ounces of butter in small bits, stirring all the while. 
Finish with chopped parsley and lemon juice. 

^^ Planked Shad 

Have a hardwood board about one inch and a half thick. 
Split the shad as for broiling, tack it on the board, skin side 
down, and roast before the fire until done. Every once in a 



114 MRS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

while rub it with a little butter. Before placing the shad on 
the board, see that the board is well seasoned and heated, else 
the fish will have the flavor of the wood. When cooked, place 
it on a hot dish, season with salt and pepper, cover with small 
bits of butter, and serve with lemon cut in quarters. 

"~ Baked Shad Roe 

Pare the roes of four large shad, sprinkle a baking dish with 
chopped onion, parsley, and mushrooms. Add the roes, strew 
over them more onion, etc., with salt, pepper, a little nutmeg, 
and small bits of butter. Moisten with a little white broth and 
two glasses of white wine. Let all cook and boil in the oven, 
basting occasionally, for twenty minutes. Drain and thicken 
the liquid with one tablespoonful of flour kneaded in butter. 
Pour this over the roes, sprinkle with fine bread crumbs, put 
small bits of butter on top, and bake in brisk oven ten minutes 
longer. Press lemon juice over and serve in the baking dish. 
The above is enough for eight persons. 

Shad Roe Cromeskies 

Wash thoroughly in cold water the roe of a shad and 
remove the skin hanging to it. Wipe it well and cut it in 
pieces of a size to wrap well in thin slices of bacon. Rub the 
pieces of shad with salt and pepper. Lay them in the slices of 
bacon, wrap the bacon round, and tie with fine twine. Have 
care that the bacon is not too thick. Drop each piece in deep 
hot fat and fry a light brown. Garnish with parsley and serve 
with a piquant sauce. 

Roast Shad with Sauce 

Have a large roe shad, scale, draw by the gills, cleanse 
nicely, and wipe dry. Make small crosswise incisions on both 
sides. Put the fish on a dish to soak for one hour with salt, 
pepper, olive oil, lemon juice, chopped parsley, chives, and 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTEBS, TEBBAPIN 115 

thyme. Be sure to turn and press it often so it will absorb the 
seasoning. Put on the spit or on a long skewer, if to roast in the 
oven, wrap in double oiled paper, making it secure by pressing 
down a shorter skewer along each side and tying at each end. 
Then roast before the fire, or in a moderate oven for forty min- 
utes. Remove the paper, brown a nice color. Place on dish, 
pour sauce round it, and serve. 

Shad Sauce 

Four shallots, chopped very fine. Put them in a saucepan 
with two ounces butter and four tablespoonfuls of white wine 
vinegar. Let it boil down to half the original quantity, then 
add one pint veloute sauce. Boil a little longer, add finely 
chopped parsley, tarragon, and about four ounces of butter in 
small bits. Mix thoroughly. 

Boiled Brook Trout (hot) 

Scale and prepare four large trout. Pour over them two 
breakfast cups of boiling vinegar, which will turn the meat 
blue, two breakfast cups of white wine, and enough water to 
cover them. Add one onion with three cloves stuck in it, one 
carrot, half a bunch of celery, four or five bay leaves, one small 
bunch of parsley, one teaspoonful of peppercorns, and salt 
to suit the taste. Boil all together for fifteen minutes in a 
covered saucepan. When done remove the fish, drain them, 
place them on a folded napkin spread on a dish. Garnish 
with parsley. Serve with any fish sauce, or with oil or vinegar. 

Boiled Brook Trout (cold) 

Clean four or more small trout. Place them in a saucepan 
with enough claret to cover them. Add a slice of lemon, two 
whole cloves, four whole peppers, a little bit of mace, and a 
heaping saltspoon of salt. Let it cook and simmer very slowly 



116 MBS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

for three-quarters of an hour. Remove from the fire, and 
when cold take out the fish. Place them in a dish and pour 
the boiled wine over them. Serve at once. 

Broiled Trout 

Scale and clean a trout. Wash and dry it well. Gash it 
across the back, and in the openings put some butter which has 
been seasoned with finely chopped chives and parsley, a little 
lemon juice, and thyme. Put the trout in a dish, season with 
a little salt and pepper and olive oil. Let it soak for about 
half an hour. Remove from the dish. Sprinkle with bread 
crumbs mixed with a few chopped herbs and then arrange on 
a well-greased gridiron. Broil over a clear fire for fifteen 
minutes or so until it is done. Turn the gridiron often and 
be sure not to burn the fish. Place on a hot dish and serve 
with any desired sauce in a separate dish. 

Fried Trout, Mountain Style 

Clean and wash a trout weighing a quarter or half a pound. 
Dry it thoroughly. Cut some salt pork in small pieces and 
place in a frying pan. When the fat is tried out, remove the 
pork. Rub the inside of the fish with a little salt. When 
the pork fat is very hot, place the fish in the pan. Turn it 
two or three times. Serve on a very hot dish. If you have 
a little fresh butter, a little may be put on the fish, but avoid 
sauces and condiments. 

Baked Brook Trout, with Forcemeat 

Select trout weighing a pound or more. Open them just 
enough to clean them properly, removing the gills and leaving 
the heads on. Wash and dry them thoroughly, and fill the 
cavities with the following forcemeat: Half a pint of bread 
crumbs soaked in a little milk, squeezed dry, and mixed with 
two ounces of good butter, one saltspoon of salt, one-half a 



FISH, 0TSTEE8, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 117 

saltspoon of white pepper, juice of quarter of a lemon, a little 
sprig of thyme, and the yoke of one raw egg. Mix thoroughly. 
Sew up the openings. Place the fish in a pan ; on top of each 
one place small bits of butter which have previously been 
rolled in flour. Place in the oven with the backs toward the 
hottest part. They should cook in twenty or thirty minutes. 
Sometimes it takes longer, for it depends upon the heat of the 
oven. 

Fillets of Sole a la Venitienne 

Take the fillets of four soles, trim and place one-half of 
them in a saucepan with some clarified butter, a little lemon 
juice, white pepper, and salt. Let them simmer slowly for ten 
minutes. Simmer the other fillets without trimming them in 
the same manner. When they are done, drain them and set away 
to cool. Cut the untrimmed fillets into small dice. Mix them 
with some thick Allemande sauce, two ounces of grated Parme- 
san cheese, white pepper and salt to taste, and a dash of grated 
nutmeg. Spread this preparation about one-sixth of an inch 
thick on an earthen dish, and when it has become firm cut it 
into pieces about the size and shape of the fillets. Roll them 
in fine bread crumbs, then in beaten egg, and then again in 
bread crumbs. Just before serving warm the fillets, fry the 
croquettes in hot lard, drain both on a piece of brown paper. 
Arrange them in a close circle, placing alternately the cro- 
quettes and the fillets. Fill the centre with small fish force- 
meat balls, fried in hot lard. Pour some Venitienne sauce in 
the centre and on the fillets and serve. 

Sole Normande, with Sauce 

Butter a tin very quickly. Boil some onions in water to 
remove the strong flavor, then slice them very thin and lay 
them on the butter. Place the sole on them. Put over it 
salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste, also some chopped parsley. 



118 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Add the juice of one lemon and as much white wine as will 
cover it. Place them in a slow oven for thirty minutes. Baste 
the sole with its own liquor very often, and add more butter if 
required. Serve with fried bread sippets and a sauce made 
from the gravy in which the fish has been cooked. 

How to make the Sauce 

Melt a tablespoonful of butter in saucepan and add a table- 
spoonful of flour. Strain the gravy from the pan in which the 
fish has been cooked. Add a full cup of it to the butter and 
flour. Let it come to a boil, then cook five minutes. Season 
to taste, add one-half cup of rich cream. Serve very hot in 
sauce-boat. 

Fillet of Sole 

Take two soles, divide them from the backbone, remove the 
heads, fins, and tails. Sprinkle the inside with pepper, salt, 
and the juice of half a lemon. Roll in the shape of a cork- 
screw, then roll them in egg, then fresh bread crumbs, then 
in egg, and bread crumbs again. Fry in hot fat and serve on 
a napkin. Garnish with lemon baskets filled with Tartare 
sauce and sprigs of parsley. 

Fillet of Sole 

Cut off the head and tail of a large flounder and set away 
for future use. Cut off the fillets from the fish and bake them 
in the oven for ten minutes and set them away to cool. Then 
make a puree of mushrooms in the following way : Peel and 
chop fine one pound of mushrooms, melt one ounce of butter, add 
one ounce of flour, and let them come to a boil. Then stir in 
one-half cup consomme, half a cup of cream, and the mushrooms, 
and boil for five minutes. Then set the mixture away to cool. 
Make a forcemeat of halibut or any kind of fish desired. Now 
lay the fish fillets on a platter, cover each one with the mush-

in a moderate oven for ten minutes. Remove carefully to a 
platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with Hollandaise sauce. 

Chartreuse of Fish a la Hauraise 

Take some nice fillets of sole, put them on a buttered baking 
tin. Season them with salt, pepper, and a little lemon juice. 
Cover them with a thick buttered paper and cook them in a 
moderate oven for six or eight minutes. Then take up the 
fillets and put them to press until cold. Cut them out with 
a plain round cutter, ornament half of them with coral 
(lobster's), and the other half with tarragon and parsley and 
truffle. Set the garnish with a little liquid aspic jelly. Line 
the Chartreuse mould with aspic jelly and arrange the rounds 
of sole all over the mould. Set this with aspic, just enough to 
make the garnish firm, and in the centre place the following 
mixture : — 

Take about half a pint of picked shrimps or lobsters, cut 
in dice shapes, two peeled tomatoes, four artichoke bottoms 
(cooked and cold), and twelve small raw oysters. Add season- 
ing and red pepper and trimmings of sole. Mix all with half 
pint of liquid aspic jelly and two large tablespoonfuls of thick 
Mayonnaise sauce. Stir all together on ice till it begins to set, 
then pour into the mould as directed. Let it stand an hour or 
more, turn out on stand, and garnish with jelly.

range the smelts on it, and broil on each side for two or three 
minutes. Serve with a Bearnaise sauce. 

Fried Smelts a la Parisienne 

Wash the smelts thoroughly, cut down the back, and take the 
bone out a little below the head and just above the tail. Clean 
well and cut away the fins and gills. Dry well and flour them. 
Roll them up by putting their tails in their mouths and fasten- 
ing them with a little wooden skewer. Set away in the ice- 
box. Have your oil or fat very hot. Fry, a few at a time, 
until a nice brown. Keep in warm place until all are fried, 
then let your oil get very hot. Put all in your frying basket, 
plunge into your hot fat. They will swell up and be a beauti- 
ful brown and crisp. Boil the number of eggs required, allow- 
ing one-half for each person. Take out the yolks and put the 
whites in cold water. Make a Tartare sauce. When ready to 
serve, fill each half egg with Tartare sauce and put round "the

tered dish, cover them with one pint of Italienne sauce, and 
bake in a hot oven for ten minutes. Squeeze some lemon juice 
over them and serve in the same dish. 

Smelt Croquettes 

Select as many medium-sized fresh smelts as you desire to 
serve. Clean and prepare them as you would for broiling, 
removing backbone, dry them, and set in cool place. Boil one 
pound of halibut, pound it fine, then add a little Sherry, white 
pepper and salt to taste. Beat in enough cream sauce to ena- 
ble you to form the mixture into small croquettes. Roll a 
smelt around each one, fastening it by sticking the head 
through the tail. Roll in beaten egg and fine bread crumbs 
and fry in hot lard. Drain on thick brown paper. Arrange a 
lemon basket in the centre of a dish, around it place the smelts 
and garnish border with half of the whites of hard-boiled eggs, 
each filled with Tartare sauce. 

Turbot a la Creme

the water over them. Drain them well and soak in milk for 
thirty minutes. Drain and wipe dry. Dredge with flour and 
roll in crumbs. Set in ice-box until wanted. Have some hot 
olive oil or clarified drippings. Put in wire basket a handful at 
a time and as soon as they rise they are done, which will be less 
than one minute. Continue frying till all are done, keeping 
the fried ones hot. When all are fried let the fat get very hot, 
put all of them in wire basket and plunge in fat for a minute 
or two. Take out, dredge with salt, and serve very hot with 
Tartare sauce, a Brown bread is always served with this fish. 

Baked Whitefish 

Season some fillets of whitefish with salt and white pepper. 
Dip them in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs, then in egg, 
then in bread crumbs again, and lastly in beaten egg. Heat a

bouillon for fifteen minutes. Set aside and let them cool in 
the liquor. Season about one pint of fine bread crumbs with 
one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. Carefully 
remove the cloth from the fish, wipe dry, and cover them with 
the bread crumbs. Then spread them with a mixture of two 
well-beaten eggs and one tablespoonful of olive oil. Sprinkle 
once more with bread crumbs. Place them in a baking pan, 
being particular to keep the circular shape. Add two and a 
half tablespoonfuls of butter. Bake in moderate oven for half 
an hour. Baste them three times. Place on a circular dish.

and seeds, and soak in cold water for three-quarters of an hour. 
Drain them and stuff with the following mixture : Cream two 
tablespoons of butter and thoroughly mix it with a quarter of a 
teaspoonf ul of pepper, one teaspoonful of mixed mustard, one- 
eighth of a teaspoonful of celery seed, and one beaten egg. 
When mixed, stir in one cupful of fine bread crumbs. Then 
add one quart of shrimps. Should the shrimps be fresh, — not 
canned ones, — you will need to season the sauce with salt. Fill 
each pepper with the mixture, sprinkle with fine bread crumbs 
and a piece of butter, and bake in quick oven for fifteen minutes.

broil over a clear fire. When cooked, place on a platter and 
pour a little melted butter over each lobster. Set in oven for 
five minutes, then serve with the following sauce: — 

Sauce for Broiled Lobster 
The quantity of sauce depends upon the number of lobsters 
you have. Mix salt, white pepper, oil, and vinegar, the same 
as for a plain French dressing, but' do not have it quite as 
strong of the vinegar. Add dry mustard to taste, and the coral 
and fat of the lobster. Stir constantly over the fire until it 
comes to a boil. When served it should be as thick as a cream. 

Stewed Lobster 
Boil four medium-sized lobsters in salted water and a gen- 
erous portion of vinegar. Remove the meat, cut in slices, and 
arrange in the serving dish. Cover with another dish and keep 
warm. Make a paste of two ounces of cracker crumbs, six 
ounces of melted butter, add white pepper, a dash of cayenne, 
and some chopped parsley. Boil three tablespoons of beef 
extract with glass of Sherry, gradually stir in the crackers and 
butter, also the fat of the lobster which has been rubbed through 
a sieve. Stir in two tablespoons of vinegar. Do not let the 
mixture boil after the crackers and butter have been added. 
Mix well and pour over the lobster. Serve immediately.

mixture, cover over with forcemeat, and put on ice for one hour 
and thirty minutes before you want it cooked. Place your 
mould in a pan of water, cover with buttered paper. Bake in 
medium oven until forcemeat is firm, from twenty-five to thirty 
minutes. When done, unmould, serve with Maryland sauce in 
the centre. Fish forcemeat is made the same as for pompano 
fillets. 

Lobster a la Newburg 

Two pounds of lobster meat, one tablespoonful of butter, 
one-half tablespoonful of flour, one cupful of cream, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of cayenne, two

Lobster Curry 

Boil a medium-sized lobster, remove the meat, and cut it in 
small pieces. Make a sauce as follows: Three ounces of butter, 
one tablespoonful of browned flour mixed together over the 
fire, and two small onions cut in very thin slices. Let this 
cook a minute or two, then stir in one pint of stock, a little 
salt, the juice of one lemon, and one tablespoonful of curry- 
dissolved in a little cold water. Boil all together until the mix- 
ture thickens, then add the lobster. Have it thoroughly heated, 
and serve at once with boiled rice in a separate dish. 



Lobster Cutlets 

Pass the meat from a large lobster through a mincing 
machine. Place it in a stewpan and moisten generously with 
curry sauce. Let it simmer, stirring frequently, for one-half 
hour. The sauce should be absorbed. Remove from the fire, 
stir in two eggs, and pour on a flat dish, as deep as you wish 
your cutlets thick. When cold, form into cutlets with a me- 
dium-sized cutter, flour them lightly, dip them in beaten egg, 
and cover them thickly with fine sifted bread crumbs. Set the 
cutlets in a cool place for half an hour and then fry in deep 
boiling fat. Drain on paper. Garnish each one with a small 
claw and serve. 

Devilled Lobster with Sauce

pinch of cayenne, a little Worcestershire sauce, and two hand- 
fuls of moistened and pressed bread crumbs. Stir steadily 
while all boils five minutes, and add the yolks of four eggs, 
some chopped parsley, and lemon juice. Mix well, fill the 
eight prepared shells, sprinkle with bread crumbs, put small 
bits of butter on top, and bake until slightly brown in a hot 
oven for eight or ten minutes. Arrange on a folded napkin, 
garnish with quartered lemons and serve with the following 
sauce in a bowl: —

Fry one tablespoon of chopped shallots in one ounce of 
melted butter until they are slightly brown, add two ladlef uls of 
Espagnole sauce, one ladlef ul broth, two tablespoonfuls of mixed 
mustard, a dash of red pepper, and a little Worcestershire 
sauce. Stir and boil for five minutes. Press through a napkin 
and stir in some chopped parsley. Serve hot. 

Stewed Terrapin 

Select live female terrapins, cover them with boiling water, 
and cook for ten minutes. Remove from the fire, and when 
sufficiently cool, scrape the skin and pull out the toe nails. 
Then cover them with fresh boiling water. Let them boil 
until they are tender. When cool, break open the shell, 
remove the meat, liver, and eggs. Be careful not to break 
the gall sac which is embedded in the liver. Save all the juice 
that comes from the terrapin while opening it. To each terra- 
pin have one-half pound of butter, one-half pint of cream, 
salt and pepper to taste. Roll the butter thoroughly in flour, 
put it in a saucepan with the cream, terrapin, eggs, liver cut 
in small pieces, and the terrapin juice. Boil steadily for 
five minutes. Rub the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs with 
enough Madeira wine to make a paste. Stir this with the 



142 MBS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

terrapin ; scald it, but do not let it boil. Serve in a chafing 
dish or individual covered dishes. If necessary, add more 
Madeira wine. 

Stewed Terrapin 

Select three large diamond back terrapin. Plunge them 
in boiling water to take the rough and hard skin off. Cook 
them in slightly salted water. Drain and take out everything 
from the shells. Remove the head, tail, nails, intestines, 
lights, and gall bladder very carefully. Put the eggs on a 
plate and cut the meat in pieces. Put this in a saucepan 
with four ounces of butter and half a pint of Madeira wine. 
Boil down until nearly dry. Mix the yolks of six eggs with 
one pint of cream, a little salt and a pinch of cayenne, six 
ounces of butter, and the eggs from the terrapin. Stir in 
the terrapin and stir steadily over a brisk fire until the sauce 
thickens. It must not boil. Serve immediately with quar- 
tered lemons. 

Terrapin a la Chamberlin 

Put a female terrapin in boiling water for five minutes, to 
loosen the skin, then take it out, skin it, and replace it in the 
hot water. When the claws are soft, it is sufficiently boiled. 
Take it out and remove the bottom shell first. Cut off the 
head and claws, and take out the gall and sand bag, then cut 
up the remainder. Cut up the entrails and all about half an 
inch long. Be careful to preserve all the juice. Put in a stew- 
pan. Make a dressing of flour, the yolks of two hard-boiled 
eggs, a third of a pound of the very best butter, a proper pro- 
portion of salt, red pepper, a small quantity of rich cream, and 
a large wine-glass of Madeira or Sherry to each terrapin. All 
of the ingredients to be of the best qualities. Dish promptly 
and serve smoking hot.

Broiled Steak 

When broiling, be sure to have a clear red bed of coals. 
Grease the wires of your broiler and place your steak on it. 
Hold each side over the extreme heat for a minute at a time, 
continue this for four or five minutes. Then hold the broiler 
farther away from the coals and keep turning the steak every 
minute or two until steak is cooked. Remove to a platter, sea- 
son with salt and pepper. Sprinkle generously with pieces of 
butter. When the butter is melted, serve plain, or with any 
sauce desired. The length of time a steak should be broiled 
depends entirely upon its thickness. A steak one inch and a 
half thick will cook underdone, or rare, in seven or eight min- 
utes. Should you have a steak two and a half or three inches 
thick, it is a good plan to begin cooking it in front of the coals. 
The centre cooks, then it can be finished over the coals. 

Broiled Fillet of Beef 

Cut three and one-half pounds of the tenderloin of beef in 
slices about three-quarters of an inch thick. Season with salt 
and pepper. Broil for five or six minutes and serve with a 
garnish of hot Bearnaise sauce. 

Larded Steak 

Take a piece of sirloin beef weighing four or five pounds. 
Cut out the bones, trim it, and lard it on one side with fine 
strips of larding pork. Season with salt and pepper. Cover 

143 



144 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

the bottom of a baking dish with a piece of pork skin, add one 
thinly sliced carrot, one sprig of thyme, one bay leaf, and one 
sliced onion. Place the beef on top, and bake in the oven for 
half an hour. Place on a dish and keep warm. Add one-half 
pint of consomme to the drippings. Boil two or three minutes. 
Skim off the grease and strain into a separate dish. Serve 
very hot. 

Stuffed Beefsteak 

Select a good-sized rump steak, about half an inch thick. 
Make some bread forcemeat and spread it over the steak, and 
roll all together and tie securely. Place it on a tin sheet set 
a little up from the bottom of a kettle. Pour in enough water 
to nearly cover it. Place the kettle where the meat will stew 
slowly for two or three hours. Serve with any sauce you may 
wish, and carve crosswise through the stuffing and meat. 

Beefsteak with Fried Onions 

Put a kettle of fat on the range where it will heat. Peel 
and thinly slice two Spanish onions. Place them in a frying 
basket. Broil the steak as previously directed. When the 
meat is cooked, move the kettle forward, and when the fat is 
very hot, plunge the basket of onions into it. Cook until crisp 
and a nice brown. Drain and arrange them round the steak, or 
in a separate dish, if wished. 

Boast Beef 

A great deal depends upon the weight and quality of a piece 
of beef in determining how long it should be cooked. One 
commonly allows nine minutes to the pound for a rib or loin 
roast if it is to be rare, and twelve minutes to the pound if you 
wish it an even red all the way through. A roast cut from the 
round or rump will take forty minutes longer than the first- 
named cuts. Rub the top and sides of the beef with salt and 
pepper, put a few small pieces of butter over the top, and place 



MM ATS 145 

it in a dripping pan. Pour about two tablespoonfuls of hot 
water in the pan, and put in hot oven with a steady heat. 
\Baste frequently while the beef is cooking. If the top burn, 
open the oven door a little. When cooked, place on a hot plat- 
ter. Sprinkle flour in a dripping pan, stir constantly, and add 
enough boiling water to make the gravy or sauce the right 
thickness. Strain and serve in separate dish. Any other sauce 
may be served with the above. Sometimes the platter is gar- 
nished with potatoes which have been roasted in the pan with 
the beef. If so, do as follows: Select and peel medium-sized 
potatoes. About half or three-quarters of an hour before the 
beef is served, cut the potatoes in two lengthwise, and place in 
the pan around the beef. Turn and baste them frequently. 
If desired, garnish dish with Yorkshire pudding made as 
follows : — 

Yorkshire Pudding 

Have at hand one and one-half pints of milk, six large 
tablespoonfuls of flour, three eggs, and one saltspoonful of salt. 
Put the flour and salt in a bowl, and stir gradually to this 
enough milk to make a stiff batter. When this is perfectly 
smooth and all the lumps are dissolved, add the remainder of 
the milk and a well-beaten egg. Whisk the mixture and pour 
it into a well-buttered, shallow tin. Bake for an hour. Then 
for another half hour, place it in the pan underneath the meat, 
so that it will catch a little of the juice from it. Cut the pud- 
ding in small, square pieces, put them on a hot dish, and serve. 
If the meat is baked, the pudding may at once be placed under it. 

Beef Pie 

Cut four and one-half pounds of sirloin beef in thin slices, 
season with salt and pepper, and arrange in a deep baking dish 
which is well buttered. Place first a layer of meat, then a layer 
of chopped parsley, mushrooms, shallots, and a ladlef ul of thick 
brown gravy, and so on untilthe dish is full. Wet the edge of 



146 MBS. seely's cook book 

the dish, cover it with a rim of puff paste, wet again, and cover 
the whole with a large, thin piece of paste. Press the edges 
closely together. Brush the top with a beaten egg, make a few 
incisions, and a hole in the centre. Bake in a moderate oven 
for one hour. Pour a little gravy inside through the hole and 
serve very hot. 

Beef Rump with Dumplings 

Cover four or five pounds of the rump of beef with cold 
water. Skim when it comes to a boil, salt the water to taste, 
and boil four or four and one-half hours until very tender. 
Remove from the pot and place in a colander over hot water, 
and cover to keep moist. Strain the beef broth through a 
soup strainer, take out some for gravy, and return the rest in 
which to boil dumplings. Thicken the gravy no thicker than 
cream. Pour some over the meat and serve the rest in a 
gravy boat. 

Dumplings 

One pint and a half of flour, one teaspoon of lard, a little 
salt, two heaping teaspoons of baking powder. Mix these, wet- 
ting with hot water. When partly mixed, add one beaten egg, 
more water, and make the dough stiff enough to drop into the 
water. Cover, and boil ten minutes, having care not to turn 
them over in the pot. Serve at once. 

_J^ Devilled Roast Beef Bones 

Take the bones from cold roast beef, leaving as much meat 
as possible on them. Season with salt and pepper, and rub 
them with mustard paste. Roll in fresh bread crumbs and 
sprinkle each one with little pieces of butter. Broil over a slow 
fire until a nice brown and serve on a hot dish with thickened 
brown gravy around them, or over them, as you wish.

Beef a la Mode 



Cut and trim neatly the under part of a round of beef and 
soak it in vinegar and spices for three or four hours. Prepare 
the vinegar as follows : Chop one onion very fine, add a little 
salt, pepper, dry mustard, and a few whole cloves. Mix all 
with one cup of vinegar and boil for five minutes. Turn the 
meat frequently. Lard it with pieces of salt pork cut about 
one-quarter of an inch square and in strips as long as the meat 
is thick. Brown three onions, one carrot, and one turnip, all 
sliced, in drippings. Place them in a pan. Brown the meat in 
the same way, fasten a cloth round the beef, so as to keep it a 
good shape, then place it in the pan on a perforated tin a little 
higher than the bottom of the pan. Cover about half with boil- 
ing water, add a small bag of herbs ; partially cover the pot, and 
simmer for three and a half hours, or until tender, — it depends 
upon the size of the beef. Remove the cloth and place the meat 
on hot platter. Skim the grease from the gravy, season with 
salt and pepper, and thicken with flour blended with a little 
water. Let it boil and brown. Strain and pour over the beef. 
Garnish with potatoes cut in fancy shapes and small boiled 
onions. 

— Fillet of Beef with Mushroom Sauce 

Buy the short fillet under the rump, using two if necessary. 
Wipe, remove the fat and veins and tendons in the middle, 
and have it well larded with thin strips of pork. All this 
can be done by the butcher. Then rub the fillet well with 
salt and pepper. Put two slices of fat pork in baking pan 
with one slice of onion and a bit of bay leaf. Place the 
meat in the pan and bake in a hot oven for thirty minutes. 
Baste often, and serve with mushroom sauce poured round the 
meat. 



148 MBS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

~" Mushroom Sauce 

Pour off all but two tablespoonfuls of drippings in the pan. 
Stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour, and, when brown add one 
pint of boiling water. Cook until it thickens. Then strain 
into a saucepan and add one cup of mushrooms, one tablespoon 
of lemon juice, and more salt if needed. Heat thoroughly but 
do not let it boil. 

Braised Roll of Beef a la Printaniere 

Select a piece of sirloin of beef well covered with fat and 
weighing about twelve or fifteen pounds. Remove the bone, 
leaving the fillet adhering to the upper part. Lard the fillet 
with pieces of ham or bacon, having the pieces one-quarter of 
an inch square and four inches long. Then roll the beef up 
close and fasten it round with a string to secure its shape. 
Break up the bones and place them with the trimmings in the 
bottom of a pan or kettle. Place the roll of beef on the bones. 
Add two carrots, two onions with a clove stuck in each, two 
heads of celery, and a small bouquet. Moisten with about 
quarter of a bottle of Sherry, and, if desired, one small glass of 
brandy. Set the whole on the range and let it simmer slowly 
for ten minutes. Then add enough good beef broth or con- 
somme to nearly cover the beef. Cover the beef with a but- 
tered paper. When the liquid comes to a boil, place where 
it will boil slowly for two or three hours, or until tender. The 
time has to be regulated by the size and tenderness of the meat. 
Dish it, place round it groups of young carrots, turned in their 
own shape, asparagus tops, small buds of cauliflower, and 
French beans cut in diamond shapes and boiled green. Cut 
some boiled turnips in the shape of deep saucers. Fill each 
one with green peas and place in a border round the dish. 
Pour some Espagnole sauce round the border of turnips, glaze 
the meat, and serve very hot.

Pried Ox Tails 

Cut between the joints in pieces about tbree inches long, 
the thick part of half a dozen ox tails. Soak in cold water fot 
about one hour. Drain, and put in a saucepan with three- 
quarters of a pound of sliced onion and one pound and three- 
quarters of sliced carrot. Season with salt and pepper, add 
one good-sized bouquet, and cover all with three quarts of 
broth. Boil over a slow fire for three or four hours, or until 
the meat is tender. Test it with a fork. Put the pieces in a 
dish and cover them with the broth. When partially cool, dip 
each piece in beaten egg, then in fine bread crumbs ; fry until a 
nice brown. Drain on brown paper. Serve hot with a tomato 
sauce. 

Corned Beef 

Select a six-pound piece of rump or brisket corned beef 
and place it in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover it. 
Let it boil briskly three hours and a half or more, until tender. 
If served with kale sprouts, add them to the meat about one- 
half hour before time for serving. Drain them on to a hot 
platter and place the corned beef on them. If wished, plain 
boiled spinach may be served instead of sprouts. 

French Creamed Corned Beef Hash 

Cut up in equal-sized pieces some nice, red cooked corned 
beef, also some cooked potatoes cut in the same way. Bo not 
chop them. To one cup of meat have three-quarters of a cup

it is well steeped, rub it with flour and salt, lay on it bits of 
butter, and set it in the oven, having added water to the dish in 
which it is to bake. Bake it for an hour, basting it often, and 
serve with a mushroom sauce. . An onion sauce may be substi- 
tuted for the mushroom sauce. 

Stewed Beef Kidney- 
Select two beef kidneys, remove the fatty substance from 
the middle, and cut in slices. Wash in salt and water, then in 
fresh water. Drain thoroughly and season with salt and pepper. 
Fry in boiling hot butter until slightly brown, shaking the sauce- 
pan all the time. Drain the butter off and put the kidneys on 
a plate. Pour a scant pint of Espagnole sauce in a saucepan 
with two wine-glasses of Sherry. Boil until quite thick. Add 
some sliced mushrooms, — seven or eight, — the kidneys, four 
ounces of butter in small bits, some chopped parsley, and lemon 
juice. Mix well without boiling. Taste, and add more season- 
ing if necessary. Dish up as high as possible on an entree dish. 

Baked Tripe 

Cut one pound and a half of tripe in small squares. Put 
them in an agate pan with five chopped onions. Season with 
salt and white pepper. Cover with stock or water and bake in 
a slow oven for three hours. Pour off the liquid, strain it into

cook for ten minutes. Remove the bouquet, add one teaspoon- 
ful of finely chopped parsley, and serve at once. 

Stewed Tripe with Tomatoes 

Wash one pound of tripe, cover it with hot water, add one 
onion cut in quarters, and stew thirty-five minutes. Stew one

Drain the tripe thoroughly, cut it in strips, and add it to the 
sauce. Boil all up together with a tablespoon of butter and 
serve. 

Fricasseed Veal 

Divide into bits of say the size of your two fingers a couple 
of pounds of veal, and make it quite free of fat, bone, and skin. 
Dissolve a couple of ounces of butter in a stewpan, and just as 
it begins to boil lay in the veal and shake the pan until the 
meat is firm, but uncolored. Stir in a tablespoon of flour, and 
when it is well mixed with the cutlets pour gradually over 
them, shaking the pan often, enough hot veal stock or gravy to 
cover them. Stew them gently until they are perfectly tender 
— this may be fifty or sixty minutes, or longer. Add salt, a 
quarter of a pint of rich cream, and, if you like, a few strips of 
lemon rind. Two or three dozen mushroom buttons added 
twenty minutes before it is served will improve the fricassee. 

Veal Potpie with Dumplings

about three inches square. Cut one-half pound of salt pork in 
thin slices. Lay the pieces of pork in the bottom of pot, then 



MEATS 153 

add pieces of veal, then more pork and veal. Cover with tepid 
water and let it slowly come to a boil. Chop one onion and 
one head of celery very fine and add to the veal. Let all simmer 
for one hour, then season to taste. Be sure you have enough 
liquid in which to cook the dumplings. Twenty minutes before 
serving, put in your dumplings, dropping them a spoonful at a 
time. Let them boil steadily for fifteen minutes. Kemove at 
once and dish. Put the meat in the centre of a deep platter 
and the dumplings round. Strain the broth in which meat and 
dumplings were cooked, and skim off all the fat. In a saucepan 
melt one tablespoonful butter, add one teaspoonful flour, and 
then the broth. Pour over the meat and serve very hot. 
Garnish with parsley. 

^> Dumpling for Potpie 

One egg, one cup of flour, half a cup of water, one teaspoon 
of baking powder, half a teaspoon of salt, a pinch of cayenne. 
Sift the flour and baking powder together and add the cayenne. 
Whip the egg very lightly and add it to the water. Then mix 
with the flour. Beat well with wire whisk. Boil in the pot 
with the meat. Do not put them too close together, but allow 
room for them to swell. 

Yeal a la Cadet 

Choose a solid piece of fat white veal. With a larding 
needle thrust inside some long strips of larding pork and ham. 
Put the veal in a hollow earthen vessel with some thinly sliced 
onion, olive oil, pieces of thyme, bay leaves, parsley, salt, and 
white pepper. Let it soak for six or seven hours, occasionally 
turning it so it will absorb the seasoning. Then place on a 
long skewer, wrap in three thicknesses of oiled paper with the 
vegetables, etc., inside, and roast in a moderate oven for one 
hour and a half, according to size. Remove the paper, leave 
the vegetables in the pan, let the veal brown, and put it on a 



154 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

dish. Add a little broth and a dash of cayenne to the liquid in 
the pan. Cook for a minute or two. Then strain and remove 
grease. Mix with one pint of tomato sauce. Heat thoroughly.

in a separate dish. 

Veal Cutlets a la Polonaise 

The following proportions are for six: Take two pounds 
of veal from a leg of veal, chop the meat fine, add two table- 
spoons of bread crumbs or of rolled cracker crumbs, one table- 
spoon of butter, four eggs, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix 
the ingredients well, form them in flat oval cutlets about half 
an inch thick, paint with the white of an egg, sprinkle with 
cracker meal, and fry in butter to a golden brown. Serve a 
slice of lemon on each cutlet. A lemon sauce is sometimes 
served with the cutlets, but more often green peas or macaroni 
with drawn butter, or a puree of potatoes. These cutlets are 
also delicious when made from the breast of a turkey or chicken. 

Veal Outlet with Puree of Cucumber 

Flatten, trim, and season with salt or pepper eight small veal 
cutlets. Fry in melted butter until a light brown on both sides. 
Drain off the butter, add one glass of sherry, a little broth, 
and two ladles of Espagnole sauce. Cover and stew fifteen 
minutes. Pour some of the puree on a dish, arrange the cutlets 
in a circle. Pour the reduced sauce over them and serve. 

Veal Cutlets London Fashion 

Take cutlets a little more than a quarter of an inch thick, 
cut from the best end of a neck of veal, free them from skin 
and fat, brush them with egg, dip them in fine bread crumbs, 
and fry them a light brown in deep fat. Toast or broil apart 
as many slices of bacon as you have cutlets, and set the bacon 
and cutlets on their edge round the inside of a hot dish, placing 



MEATS 155 

them alternately. Pour in the middle a rich gravy, or sub- 
stitute for this a rich mushroom sauce. Savory herbs and 
salt and pepper should be mixed with the bread crumbs. 

Veal Loaf 

Cut the last shavings from the almost naked bone of a boiled 

ham. If you have no cold veal, cook one pound of it. The 

coarsest piece will do, but it must be lean. While the meat 

cools, boil down the liquor it was boiled in until there is only 

one-half cupful. If your veal is already cooked, treat a cupful 

of gravy the same way. Add to this a teaspoonful of butter, 

the juice of half a lemon, pepper and salt to taste, and a pinch 

of mace. Chop the veal and ham very fine, mix well together. 

Moisten thoroughly with the gravy and press into a bowl or 

mould. Cover the surface with a small plate, and on this set a 

heavy weight. By the following day it will be firm. Invert 

it on a dish and cut in thin slices. Scraps of poultry may be 

worked up nicely with the ham. Keeping an eye to the odds 

and ends enables one to make many a tasty relish without extra 

expense. 

Veal a la Marengo 

Cut three and a half pounds of lean veal in small pieces. 
Put them in a saucepan with two and a half ounces of pork 
and one onion, both cut in small pieces. Shake them round in 
the pan and, when a nice brown, sprinkle with three scant 
tablespoons of flour. Stir all together. Then add one quart 
of broth and one gill of tomato sauce. Season with salt, pepper, 
a bouquet, and a little garlic. Cook all for forty-five minutes. 
Serve on a hot platter and garnish with squares of bread fried 
a golden brown color. Sprinkle finely chopped parsley over 
the meat. 

Plaw 

Boil a piece of lean veal till it is tender. Take it up, cut it 
in strips three or four inches long, put it back in the pot with 



156 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

the liquor it was boiled in, and add a teacup of rice to three 
pounds of veal. For the same quantity of veal allow a piece of 
butter the size of an egg. Season with salt, pepper, and sweet 
herbs if you like. Stew gently till the rice is tender and the 
water nearly stewed away. 

Knuckle of Veal with Rice 

Pour over a small knuckle of veal rather more than water 
enough to cover it, bring it slowly to a boil, take off the scum 
with great care, and throw in a teaspoon of salt. When the 
joint has simmered for about half an hour, throw in from eight 
to twelve ounces of well-washed rice, and stew the meat gently 
for an hour and a half longer, or until both meat and rice are 
perfectly tender. A seasoning of cayenne and more salt, 
should it be required, are added twenty or thirty minutes before 
serving. If it is at hand, good veal broth may with advantage 
be substituted for the water. 

Pickled Veal 

Cut cold cooked veal in small pieces and cover with scalding 
hot vinegar. To three scant pints of vinegar add ten whole 
cloves, half a stick of cinnamon, one teaspoonful of salt, and ten 
peppercorns. Stir these into the scalding vinegar and then 
pour over the veal. Let the mixture stand for one day. It is 
then ready to serve for luncheon or supper. 

Meat and Nut Balls 

Blanch the nuts and allow thirty to every pint of chopped 
meat. The nuts should also be chopped. Either veal or lamb 
may be used. Mix the nuts and meat, season with pepper and 
salt, and use an egg or two for binding the whole together. 
Mould in small balls, or roll them out in croquette form and 
lay them in a baking dish. Pour over them a pint of strained 



MEATS 157 

tomatoes, allowing a pint to a pint of the mixture of nuts and 
meat, and cook fifteen or twenty minutes. Serve the balls on 
a hot dish, and pour round them the thickened tomatoes. 

Sweetbread Jardiniere with Sauce 

Prepare three pairs of sweetbreads by first letting them 
stand in cold water for one hour. Change the water during 
that time. Then put them over the fire with enough white 
stock to cover them. Add one teaspoonful of salt, six whole 
peppers, one blade of mace, one onion, one slice of carrot, and a 
stalk of celery. Let them come to the boiling-point, remove, 
and leave them in the liquor until cold enough to handle. 
Then remove all the skin and fatty parts and cut them in the 
shape of a chop. Press them by putting a plate on top and 
setting a light weight on it, to keep them in shape. Leave 
them in the press one hour. Put two ounces of butter in a 
saucepan and clarify it. Then add the sweetbreads. When 
they become a rich golden brown, remove them and keep them 
in a warm place. Have some nice chicken forcemeat. Put a 
layer of it on top of each sweetbread, and on top of that, a slice 
of cooked beef tongue a little smaller than the sweetbread. 
Wrap each one in oiled paper. Place in a pan and steam on 
top of the range until the forcemeat is firm. Have some spinach 
cooked and put through a fine sieve. Place on a dish a mould 
of spinach. With spinach in a pastry bag ornament the edges 
of the dish, and in the centre make a rosette so the sweetbreads 
will have a support. Have some nice white turnips cooked in 
stock. Cut them in halves, or with a fancy cutter cut each one 
the desired size. Then with a small cutter scoop out the inside 
of the turnip. Let them stand in the broth they were cooked 
in until wanted. Now dish your sweetbreads, remove the 
paper. Place them round on the spinach border. Put turnips 
round the dish, fill each one with green peas. Serve with the 
following sauce : —

oughly. Put in a baking pan two tablespoonfuls of butter and 
half a pint of broth, and place the onions so they do not touch 
each other. Cover them with two tablespoons of granulated 
sugar. Bake in oven for fifteen minutes. Be sure to turn 
them often, so they will become evenly colored. 

Fried Calf's Liver and Bacon 

Cut the necessary amount of calf's liver in thin slices and 
wash it in cold water. Place some thin slices of bacon in a hot 
pan and cook them until they are crisp. Remove from the pan 
and keep them hot. Place the pan where there is not an 
intense heat, drop the slices of liver into the bacon fat, and cook 
slowly — for five or six minutes or until cooked. Serve on 
a hot platter and garnish with the bacon. Liver should be 
cooked slowly to make it moist and wholesome. 

Fried Calf's Brains 

Remove the arteries and soak four calves' brains in cold 
water for two hours. Put in a saucepan with water which 
tastes strongly of vinegar, a few peppercorns, salt, a bunch of 
parsley with herbs tied in it, and a sliced onion. Boil slowly 
for forty minutes. Drain on a cloth. Divide each lobe in two 
or more pieces. Sprinkle the pieces with dry crumbs, dip in 
beaten eggs, roll in fresh white crumbs, and arrange in a frying 
basket. Immerse in plenty of very hot fat and fry a nice color.

twenty small onions in one ounce and a half of butter. When 
a good color add a little flour, enough to absorb the butter. 
Stir for a few minutes, then stir in one-half cupful of stock and 
one cup of claret. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. 
Set the pan where the sauce will cook slowly for half an hour. 
Empty one can of mushrooms, wash them, and cut in moderately 
small pieces. Mix these with the sauce and boil for ten min- 
utes. Garnish the brains with the vegetables and pour the 
sauce over all. 

Calf's Brains a la Vinaigrette 

Wash three good-sized calves' brains, remove the skins, and 
then wash again. Drain thoroughly. Put them in a sauce- 
pan and cover with fresh water, three small pinches of salt, half 
a cup of vinegar, one carrot sliced, a dozen whole peppers, sprig 
of thyme, and one bay leaf. Cook for ten minutes. Drain 
thoroughly. Cut each brain in half. Serve hot on a folded 
napkin on a dish with vinaigrette sauce in a sauce-boat. Gar- 
nish with parsley. 

Calf's Head 

The butcher should first prepare the head for use. Wash 
it thoroughly and remove the brains, which may be kept for 
frying, as mock oysters, or may be added later. Cover with 
cold water, take off the scum as the head begins to heat, and 
boil it gently from one to two hours. Remove from the fire, 
let it cool, and bone it entirely. Lay the boned head in a stew- 
pan, replace the brains if you wish to stew them, and simmer 
gently for an hour in its own gravy. Half an hour before it 
is served, add a pint of mushroom buttons. If it is necessary, 
thicken the gravy with a little flour or corn-starch and lay 



164 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

forcemeat balls round the dish in which the head is served. 
Salt to taste and cayenne pepper should be added during the 
stewing. If you have not the mushrooms at hand, a bunch of 
sage leaves finely minced may be added instead. 

Calf's Heart Roasted 

Make a forcemeat of fine bread crumbs, a quarter of a pound 
of beef suet chopped small, a little parsley, sweet marjoram, 
pepper, salt, and if your taste finds them agreeable, lemon peel 
and nutmeg. Mix these ingredients with the yolk of an egg 
and place them in the heart. Tie the heart and roast, turning 
it frequently. Serve with slices of lemon and melted butter 
poured over it. 

Pried Chops with Brown Sauoe

the meat from the broth and place in another saucepan. Rub 
the sauce through a fine sieve over the meat. Add a bouquet, 
a few carrots and turnips cut in small pieces, and eighteen small 
onions sugared and browned in butter. Boil half an hour, then 
add one pint of raw potato balls. Boil slowly half an hour 
longer. Place the saucepan at the side of the range and let it 
stand for fifteen minutes. Skim off all the fat and remove the 
bouquet. Dish in conical form and serve. 

Hind Quarter of Spring Lamb 

Select a medium-sized hind quarter of lamb. Trim the bone 
and place the flank over the ribs to prevent them from being 
cooked too much. Fasten all together securely. Season with 
one tablespoon of salt, rubbing it over the meat. Cover it with 
the thin fat and place it in a dripping pan with one tablespoon- 
ful of water. Place in a moderate oven and roast for one hour, 
basting it with its own drippings. Remove the fat, cover the 
bone with paper ruffle, and serve on a hot dish. Skim the 
grease from the drippings and strain it over the lamb. Serve 
mint sauce with it if wished. 

Curry of Lamb with Asparagus Tops 

Cut three and a half pounds of shoulder of lamb in two-inch 
squares.' Wash thoroughly and drain. Place in a saucepan

Select a medium-sized leg of mutton, cut off the bone and 
trim it. Rub it with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with little 
pieces of butter and roast in a moderate oven for one hour and 
a quarter. Baste often and turn it three or four times while it 
is roasting. Serve with either the strained gravy from the pan 
or thickened gravy. 

Boast Mutton 

Select a nice breast of mutton weighing about eight pounds. 
Sew it up in a piece of muslin or any thin cloth. Place it in a 
kettle with enough water to cover it. Let it stew or boil very 
slowly for one hour and twenty -five minutes. Remove the 
cloth and place the meat in a dripping pan. Rub it well with 
melted butter or drippings. Sprinkle with a little flour and roast 
in oven for about half or three-quarters of an hour. Baste it often 
with contents of the pan. Just before serving, sprinkle with 
fine crumbs and dots of butter. Let it get a nice brown. Gar- 
nish the dish with parsley. Make a sauce of the strained drip- 
pings from the meat.

Chops a la Signora with Sauce 
Cook one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful of 
flour for two minutes. Add one cupful of white broth and 
cook to a thick, smooth sauce. Then add one cupful of finely- 
cut cooked chicken, half a cup of finely cut canned mushrooms, 
and, if handy, a little finely cut tongue and a little cream. 
Season to taste with salt, white pepper, and, if desired, a little 
grated nutmeg. Stir over the fire for five minutes. Spread 
on a dish and set aside until cold. Select six nice Frenched 
chops. Split them in half without separating them and season 
with salt and pepper. Spread a thin layer of chicken between 
the two layers of each chop. Close each one, giving each chop 
its original form. Dip in beaten egg, then cover with bread 
crumbs, and fry in clarified butter until a golden color and well 
done. Dress them in a circle on a hot dish, arrange a curled 
paper on each one, and serve with the following sauce : — 

Sauce for Chops 

Cook two tablespoonfuls each of finely chopped tongue and 
mushrooms with two tablespoonfuls of Madeira wine until dry. 
Then add one cupful of Espagnole sauce and one-half cup of 
stewed, strained tomatoes. Cook five minutes and serve in sepa- 
rate dish or in the centre of the chop dish. If desired, the chops 
may rest on pieces of fried bread the same size as the chops. 

Roast Saddle of Mutton 
Trim a small saddle of Southdown mutton. Pull off the 
thin skin and make a small cut in the fat. Remove nearly all 
the suet inside, also the kidneys. Tie firmly in a neat shape 
and roast in quite a hot oven for one hour and a half. Drain, 
and let it stand in a warm place for ten or fifteen minutes. 
Skim all the grease from the drippings, add a little flour and 
stock, make a brown gravy, and serve in separate dish. Also 
serve currant jelly.

Boiled Leg of Mutton 

Trim a medium-sized leg of mutton, put in a kettle with one 
bouquet and enough salted cold water to cover it. Boil for 
one hour and a half, or until tender. Serve with caper sauce 
made of plain cream sauce with capers, or Hollandaise sauce 
with a handful of capers added. The sauce must be served 
hot. 

Mutton Stew 

Remove the skin from three pounds of mutton cut from the 
shoulder. Cut the fat from it, place in a saucepan, and cook it 
until there is about five tablespoonfuls of liquid. Remove the 
fat and add one scant quart of sliced onion. Cover and place 
where it will cook slowly for one hour. Occasionally stir it. 
Then stir in one tablespoonful of flour and the mutton cut 
in small pieces. Cook until it is slightly browned, and then 
add one quart of boiling water, three teaspoonfuls of salt, 
one teaspoonful of pepper. Let it simmer for one hour and 
three-quarters, then add one quart of sliced raw potato 
and one tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley. Simmer 
for half an hour longer, or until the meat and potatoes are 
tender. Add more salt and pepper, if necessary, and serve very 
hot. 

Devilled Mutton 

Slice some undercooked mutton about one inch thick, score 
it, and spread with the following mixture : One teaspoonful 
of dry mustard, two teaspoonfuls of olive oil, one teaspoonful 
of vinegar, and half a teaspoonful of white pepper, and a dash of 
cayenne pepper. Mix thoroughly before spreading on the 
meat. Place the slices on a greased broiler and cook over a 
clear fire for six or seven minutes. Frequently turn the 
broiler and avoid scorching the meat. Serve with maitre 
d'hotel sauce.

Boiled Leg of Mutton 

Take a well-kept but perfectly sweet leg of mutton of mid- 
dling weight, and after having washed (not soaked) it, lay it in 
a kettle of its size, as nearly as possible, and pour in rather more 
than sufficient cold water to cover it. Set the kettle over a 
good fire, and when the water begins to boil take off the scum, 
and continue to till no more appears. After the first skimming 
throw in a tablespoonful of salt, and after the water is well 
cleared, add two medium-sized onions stuck with a dozen 
cloves and a bundle or bouquet of parsley, thyme, and savory, 
four or five large carrots, and a half an hour afterward as 
many turnips. Draw the kettle to a spot on the range where 
the mutton will simmer gently for two hours and a half from 
the time it first begins to boil. If stewed gently, the mutton 
will be found excellent. If hurried, it will be like the unpala- 
table, hard, and ragged fast-boiled meat sent up by ignorant 
and tasteless cooks and served by inexperienced housekeepers. 
Boiled mutton should be served with caper sauce or brown 
cucumber sauce or oyster sauce. From the liquor in which the 
mutton is boiled excellent soup may be made. 

Plain Boiled Mutton 

Cover with cold water and skim when the pot has come to a 
boil. Salt the water to taste. Boil gently until very tender. 
Add three or four whole onions. 

Mutton Pilau 

Boil rice till the kernels are quite done and yet unbroken. 
Cut cold boiled mutton in pieces an inch square, fry in butter, 
and season with salt, pepper, a few cardamons, a little onion, 
and chopped mint. After the mixture has simmered half an 
hour, add a little of the boiled rice and continue the cooking 
fifteen or twenty minutes. The gravy formed by the butter, 



170 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

seasoning, and rice should slightly flavor the browned mutton. 
Serve by laying some of the boiled rice on a dish and laying on 
it mutton and gravy, then putting on another layer of rice and 
upon this pouring mutton and gravy. 

Mutton Cromeskies 

Prepare the cold mutton by mincing it and seasoning it with 
salt, pepper, and thyme and parsley, or chopped onion, if you 
wish. Lay a little of the mince upon some slices of bacon cut 
very thin. Roll the bacon tightly and neatly round the mutton 
so that none may escape and tie the pieces round with fine 
twine. Dip each of the cromeskies in a frying batter and then 
drop them in deep, hot fat and fry to a delicate brown. Lay 
them round the edges of a dish piled in mountain form with 
plain boiled rice or mashed potato and garnished with tiny trees 
of parsley stuck in the sides. 

Gold Boast Leg of Mutton 

When a few slices have been cut from the joint, it will still 
afford a fillet of tolerable size, which may be dressed into a more 
savory dish than hash or mince. To do this, take off as much 
of the large end of the leg as will make that side of the fillet 
perfectly flat, cut also evenly through the joint where it has 
been carved. Now bone the fillet and place in the cavity veal 
forcemeat. Put the meat with the bones and trimmings into a 
kettle and cover them with water, or with broth if you have 
any stock at hand. As soon as it begins to boil, add a couple 
of onions, a bunch of parsley, two or three bay leaves, four or 
five carrots and turnips — plenty of vegetables, in fact. Let 
the whole simmer gently for a couple of hours. Serve the 
meat with the vegetables round it, and, if you wish, thicken the 
gravy. Some pungent or spicy sauce, which your taste tells 
you is in harmony with the dish, may also be added.

Loin of Mutton dressed like Venison 

Skin and bone a loin of mutton and lay it in a braising pan 
with a pint of water, a large onion stuck with a dozen cloves, 
half a pint of Port wine, and a spoonful of vinegar. Add, also, 
when it boils, a small bouquet of thyme and parsley ; also pepper 
and salt. Let the whole stew three hours, turning the loin 
often. Stew the bones in another dish and add their gravy to 
the mutton as it requires liquor. Serve moist with the gravy 
in which it stews. 

Boned Leg of Mutton 

Have the butcher remove the bone of a nice fat leg of mutton 
that has been well hung. Make a forcemeat of bread crumbs, 
hard-boiled eggs, and onions chopped fine, and season with 
butter, a little sage, black pepper, and some salt pork cut up in 
small bits. Fill the leg with this forcemeat and bake several 
hours, basting often. The bone cut from the leg may be broken 
and with the trimmings of the meat boiled in the broth pot 
with rice for a most nourishing and palatable broth. 

Irish Stew 

Cut in pieces between the joints like chops two pounds of 
the scrag of muttou. Slice three medium-sized onions in an iron 
saucepan, set over the fire well covered, and let the onions fry in 
their own juice, stirring and watching them that they may not 
burn. When they are done, lay in the meat and add one and 
a half quarts of water. Let the mixture come to a boil, and 
now upon further action the success or failure of your stew 
depends. "Watch every minute or so till you find the spot on 
the range where the mixture will just simmer, no more — sim- 
mering is a slight motion, or sizzling, at one side of the sauce- 
pan. Add a teaspoon of salt, a half saltspoon of pepper, and 
let the meat cook two hours well covered. At the end of that 
time have ready as many potatoes as you need. Skim all the 



172 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

fat from the gravy. Cut up two potatoes in thin slices. These 

are to break and thicken the gravy. Then lay the others over 

the meat, cutting them in two if they are large. Do not mind 

if the gravy is not enough to cover the potatoes. It would be 

only broth if it were to do that. They are to cook by steam. 

Irish stew must always be closely covered while cooking. If 

the meat is stewed carefully and slowly, it will be so tender that 

you can tear it with a fork, and yet not tasteless and " done to 

rags." 

Real Scotch Hotch Potch 

Cut up two pounds of scrag of mutton — the scrag is best 
because it is lean and carries the sweetness of the bone with its 
cooking, but any other lean part may be used. Put it on the fire to 
stew in one and a half pints of water and cook gently as directed 
for Irish stew for an hour and a half. Then cut up small a carrot, 
onion, and turnip, and add them to the meat with a teaspoon of 
salt and a scant one-half ounce of pepper. Add also half a can of 
fine marrowfat peas, mixing with the liquor of the peas a dessert- 
spoon of flour to thicken. Half an hour before serving add the 
other half of the peas. Be sure to skim off carefully all the fat 
after the meat is taken up, and if the gravy seems too plentiful, 
boil it down rapidly for a few minutes. In serving, lay the 
mutton in the centre of a dish and let the peas and other 
vegetables encircle it. 

Mutton Croquettes 

Have at hand one good pint of finely chopped mutton. 
Season with one tablespoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of 
white pepper, and one tablespoonful of lemon juice. Scald one 
cup of milk, mix one tablespoonful of flour and three tablespoon- 
fuls of butter together and stir in the milk. Then add the 
mutton. Boil for four minutes. Stir in two well-beaten eggs. 
Turn out on a platter. When cool, shape into the desired size, 
roll in fine bread crumbs, then in beaten egg, and again in bread 



MEATS 173 

crumbs. Fry in hot fat until a nice brown. The fat for frying 
should be the boiling degree of heat. If not, the croquettes will 
break open and absorb the grease. 

Broiled Lamb's Kidneys 

Skin, trim, and split lengthwise one dozen kidneys. Put 
them in a dish and season with salt, pepper, and sweet oil. 
Then put them on skewers — if not silver, have them bright 
and fresh-looking. Run the skewer through the centre of the 
two kidneys; do not separate them. Roll in fine bread crumbs 
and broil over a moderate fire for five minutes. Serve on a 
folded napkin with a thick brown sauce seasoned with Madeira 
in a separate dish. 

Devilled Lamb's Kidneys 

Prepare the kidneys the same as for broiling, and broil them 

for a minute or two on each side. Remove from the fire. Roll 

them well in English mustard paste which is seasoned with salt, 

a little white pepper, and a dash of cayenne. Then roll again 

in fine bread crumbs. Return them to the fire and broil four 

of five minutes longer. Serve with maitre d'hotel sauce poured 

over them. 

Baked Fork and Beans 

Soak one quart of white beans in cold water for twelve 
hours. Then put them in a pan with four quarts of cold water. 
Let them come to a boil and add salt, white pepper to taste, a 
white onion with two whole cloves stuck in it, one carrot, a 
bunch of parsley, and a four-pound piece of salt pork — a streak 
of fat and a streak of lean. Before adding the pork, soak it for 
two hours in tepid water. Boil all slowly for two hours. Take 
the pork out and let it drain. Also remove the onion, carrots, 
and parsley. Strain off the liquid from the beans. Pour them 
into a hollow baking dish — an earthen one is the better — with 
two tablespoonfuls of molasses over them. Score the fatty 



174 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

side of the pork. Press it down in the centre of the beans. 
Bake one hour in a moderate oven. Occasionally baste the pork 
with the gravy from the beans. Serve in the baking dish. 
Have it either hot or cold. 

Boiled Ham 

Soak the ham twenty-four hours, or more if large, or dry 
and hard. Put it in cold water and set on the back of the 
stove with a few soup vegetables or herbs. Cook very gently 
from eight to ten hours. The ham should stay on the stove four 
or five hours before it really starts to cook. It should then 
simmer very gently. Take up the ham ; and if you have time, 
let it get cold. Remove the skin, trim neatly, and put it on to 
braise for one hour in Sherry or Champagne. Take up, bake 
about thirty minutes, and serve with red currant jelly on the 
top. 

Baked Ham with Hot Sauce 

Remove the thigh-bone of the ham and let it soak in cold 
water for twenty-four hours before cooking. Then put it in 
a boiler and boil gradually for three hours. Take it out and 
remove the rind. Place it in a tightly covered pan with a few 
carrots, onions, blade of mace, whole cloves, allspice, bay leaf, 
and one bunch of cooking celery, and add about four quarts of 
stock or water. Place the pan in the oven and be careful that 
your lid fits closely. Let the ham steam slowly for three hours. 
Remove it from the oven and let it cool in the liquor. If the 
ham is served hot, send it to the table as soon as taken from 
the oven. The above is for a ham weighing from eighteen to 
twenty pounds. 

Hot Sauce for Baked Ham 

Brown a little flour and butter in the oven until it becomes 
rather a dark brown. Then remove all the fat from the stock 
in which the ham was cooked. Strain it and add the browned 




BOXED HAM.

butter and flour. Stir well and boil it down, adding a little 
pepper. Strain the sauce again before serving. Just before 
sending to the table add a little Sherry or Champagne. 

^>" Ham. Boiled in Cider 

Wash well a fine ham. Soak it over night in clear spring 
water, and in the morning set it to boil in a kettle of hot cider. 
The kettle should be porcelain, so that the acid of the cider will 
not eat the metal and give a metallic taste to the meat. Boil 
slowly five to eight hours, that is, until the ham is thoroughly 
cooked, and set to cool in the liquid in which it is boiled. 

The cider flavor is finer if a barrel of cider is left out doors 
to freeze, and after it is about half frozen through the heart of 
the cider is drawn off for this boiling. This was done for hams 
used at a supper given by a lawyer to forty or fifty friends. 
Some of these men were gourmets, and they all marvelled at 
the " Champagne taste " of the delicious meat. A small bag of 
spices — cloves, mace, cinnamon — thrown in the boiling cider 
gives added flavor. 

Boiled Ham a la Chamberlin 

Put the ham in a tub of cold water, fleshy part downward, 
skin part up, the night before boiling. Next morning put the 
ham in a large kettle or pot of cold water to boil. Let the 
water get hot gradually and continue to cook the ham in a 
slow boil scarcely more than a simmer. At the end of five 
hours take the ham out, throw the water out of the pot, and 
fill it with fresh cold water. Put the ham back immediately 
and let it simmer or boil slowly five hours more. Then add, 
according to the money you wish to spend, a gallon of vinegar, 
or a gallon of claret, or Burgundy, or Champagne, then simmer 
or boil for three hours more. Then take the ham off, skin it, 
and put in a cool place; to prevent the ham from tearing, it is 
always safe to sew a piece of cotton cloth tightly round the 



176 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

ham so as to fit it as close as a glove. This will keep the meat 
firm and guard against the neglect of the cook in letting the 
water boil too fast. 

Virginia Ham 

Put the ham in bucket of tepid water and allow it to stand 
all night. In morning put in pot of cold water and allow it 
to come to simmer, not boiling, and stew five hours. If wine 
flavor is wished, make a boiling mixture of one quart of Cham- 
pagne, one quart of Burgundy, a pinch of mace, and a pinch of 
cloves. Let the ham stand, after taking it off the stove, in its 
juice twenty-four hours. 

Ham Mousse 

Cut a slice of raw ham in pieces, rejecting all fat, and put 
it in cold water for two hours, changing the water quite often. 
Then drain, dry in a clean towel. Scrape with a sharp knife. 
Put through a very fine puree sieve. Take the breast of a 
nice roasted chicken, scrape that also, and put through a sieve. 
Then weigh chicken, also the ham. There should be four 
ounces of each, good weight. Put both in wooden bowl, and 
with a potato masher pound them to a paste. Whip the whites 
of two eggs and work in with the masher. Set to cool. Make 
a sauce of one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful of 
flour. Let both boil, and then add one cup of well-seasoned 
chicken broth, in which one onion, carrot, celery, whole pepper, 
and blade of mace have been cooked. Add one-half teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one-fourth teaspoon of pepper, a pinch of cayenne, 
and the yolks of two eggs whipped with a tablespoonful of 
cream. Set aside to cool. When cold, add it to the meat. 
Whip half a pint of cream and add to the mixture. Care must 
be taken not to whip your cream too much; it may separate. 
Be sure you have it well flavored before you add the cream. 
Set in the ice-box a few minutes. Decorate your mould, and be 



MEATS 177 

sure it is well buttered so that the decorations stick to it, then 
put on ice to harden. When well chilled, put in your force- 
meat, giving the mould a few knocks on the table to settle the 
forcemeat to get it even so that it will not break when dished. 
Thirty minutes before serving, put your mould in pan of hot 
water. Put buttered paper over it, and poach until it is firm 
to the touch. Serve with princess sauce. 

This mousse may be served hot or cold. It can be done 
with all chicken or all ham, according to the taste. Be sure 
you weigh and measure correctly. Measure your half-pint of 
cream before you whip it. 

Sucking Pig a la Russe with Horseradish Sauce 

Boil a fat sucking pig in a soup you have made of vegeta- 
bles. To make the soup, use vegetables such as usually go to 
the making of vegetable soup, — carrots, turnips, etc., — a season- 
ing of onion, not forgetting a bouquet of majoram, thyme, sum- 
mer savory, etc. Vinegar should be added to the broth, and 
therefore a porcelain kettle had best be used. When the pig is 
thoroughly cooked — its tenderness is tested by a skewer or 
fork — carve it, sprinkle with parsley, pour the horseradish 
sauce given below over it, and serve. 

Horseradish Sauce 

Grate the horseradish, fry in butter mixed with a little 
bouillon, add several tablespoons of rich cream, and cook until 
tender. Set off the stove, add the yolks of a couple of eggs, 
warm again, but do not boil. 

This delicious sauce is, in Russia, also often served with 
corned beef and beef au naturel. 

Roast Pig 
Select a pig about three weeks old. After it is thoroughly 
cleaned, washed, and dried, rub the inside with one teaspoonful

of salt. Fill it with bread forcemeat and sew up the open- 
ing. Press the fore feet forward and the hind feet backward. 
Skewer them in position, and place in a pan. Rub the entire 
body with melted butter, dredge it with salt and a little white 
pepper. Cover the ears and tail with buttered paper to keep 
them from crisping, and place a piece of wood in the mouth to 
keep it open. Bake in a moderate oven for three hours and 
a half, basting it frequently with melted butter. About one- 
half hour before it is thoroughly cooked remove the buttered 
paper that the ears and tail may become brown. When cooked 
arrange on a platter, place a red apple or a piece of lemon in 
the mouth, and serve with apple sauce. 

Roast Pork 
Select four pounds of the loin of pork. Rub well with two 
tablespoonfuls of salt and one teaspoonful of pepper. Let it 
stand for two or three hours. Place it in a pan with a half cup 
of water, and roast in a moderate oven for two hours. Baste 
often with the drippings. When done, the meat should be 
almost white. Serve on a hot platter, with apple sauce in a 
separate dish. Make a thick gravy with the contents of drip- 
ping pan. Strain and serve in a sauce-boat. 

Crown of Pork 
Trim and shape ten or twelve pork chops into a crown. 
Fill the centre with a mixture of sausage meat and bread 
crumbs moistened with egg. Roast in a moderate oven for 
one hour and three-quarters. Fry in butter fifty whole, small 
onions until a light brown, then cook them in stock until ten- 
der. Place some in the centre of the pork, the rest used for a 
garnish. Serve with Espagnole sauce.

goose stuffing may be inserted under the knuckle skin, and the 
dish may be garnished with balls of fried stuffing. Serve with 
sour apple sauce or with gooseberry jam a little sweetened. 

> Mock Duck 

Have your butcher split lengthwise a pork tenderloin. 
Make for it the same stuffing you would make for duck. Sew 
the tenderloin together, enclosing the stuffing, and roast, bast-

to the table garnished with quarters of apple cooked without 
sugar.

beaten yolks of four eggs. Take the mixture from the fire and 
let it get cold, then form croquettes. Dip them in egg, and 
then in bread crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat. Serve with any 
sauce to your taste. 



CHAPTER VII 

POULTRY AND GAME 
Chicken Gumbo 

Cut two chickens in pieces and fry until a delicate brown 
in half a cupful of salt pork fat, — obtained by frying half a 
pound of salt pork slowly. When the chicken is cooked, take 
it up and put it into a large stewpan. Into the fat in which 
the chicken was fried put a large onion cut in thin slices and 
fry slowly for ten minutes. Then add one quart of okra, cut 
fine, five sliced tomatoes, and two sprigs of parsley. Fry all 
these ingredients rather slowly for one-half an hour, then add 
them to the fried chicken. Pour into the dish a pint and a half 
of boiling water and season with one-half teaspoonful of pepper 
and two scant tablespoonfuls of salt. Stew slowly for two 
hours. Then add a cupful of cream and one cup of boiled 
rice. Taste, to be sure there is enough seasoning, and if there 
is, boil up once and serve. When fresh okra cannot be obtained, 
one can of the article may be substituted. The chicken may 
be a year or more old. A dash of cayenne instead of white 
pepper may be used. 

Marinade of Chicken 

Take two medium-sized boiled chickens, when cold cut 
them up, remove the skin, and place them in a hollow dish with 
salt, pepper, a sliced onion, chopped parsley, two glasses of oil, 
and the juice of two lemons. Mix them well and let them 
steep for one hour. Fifteen minutes before serving, drain; 
then dip each piece in a flour batter and drop them one by one 

180 



POULTRY AND GAME 181 

in deep hot fat. Give them a nice colqr, drain on brown 
paper, sprinkle a little salt over them. Dish on a folded nap- 
kin, surrounded with fried parsley, and serve with a bowl of 
tomato sauce. 

Flour Batter for Marinade 

One-half pound sifted flour, yolks of three eggs, and cold 
water to desired thickness. Beat the whites of the eggs to a 
stiff froth and thoroughly mix with the batter. 

Ballottines of Legs of Fowls 

Cut open eight fowls' legs, remove all the bones and sinews. 
Spread the meat on the table, season with pepper and salt, and 
place a tablespoonful of forcemeat, seasoned with herbs, in the 
centre of each. Sew them in an oblong or oval shape. Place 
a few slices of onion, carrot, and celery in a stewpan, arrange 
the ballottines on them and cover with thin slices of fat bacon. 
Moisten them half their height with broth, cover with greased 
paper, place the cover on the pan, and cook them slowly in the 
oven for half an hour. Baste them frequently. When cooked, 
remove, and put them in press between two dishes until they 
are cold. Trim them and place in a saucepan with a little 
broth and cover with greased paper ; let them simmer slowly 
in the oven for fifteen minutes. Cover them with a glaze, dish 
them in a circle, with a braised lettuce between each one. Fill 
the centre with a jardiniere of vegetables. Pour Espagnole 
sauce around the entree and serve. 

Fried Chicken with Cream Sauce 
Singe, draw, and cut two tender chickens in quarters. 
Crack the main bones, flatten slightly, and put in a saucepan 
with five ounces of melted butter, a little salt, and white pep- 
per. Cover, place over a brisk fire, and fry a light brown on 
each side. Drain off most of the butter, sprinkle with one 
ounce of well-sifted flour, mix well, and add one and one-half 



182 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

pints of cream ; cover and boil ten minutes. Remove the 
chicken and to the sauce add two small pats of butter and the 
juice of half a lemon. Pour this over the chicken, sprinkle 
with chopped parsley, and serve very hot. 

Chicken Croquettes 

Chop and pound to a powder one cup of cold chicken — the 
white meat. Season with salt, celery salt, and cayenne. Add 
one cup of thick cream sauce, or more if the thickening will 
absorb it. Set away to cool. Then shape the chicken in the 
form you wish, roll the croquettes in fine bread crumbs, then 
in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat. 

Chicken Cromeskies 
To a tablespoon of butter in a frying pan add a teacup of 
milk thickened with a tablespoon of flour. To this add a large 
cup of minced chicken, seasoned with minced mushrooms and 
parsley, a teaspoon of finely minced onion, and a little salt, and 
let the whole cook up. Take slices of a boiled ham or slices of 
uncooked bacon, roll portions of the chicken mixture in them, 
fixing each piece with a skewer or tying each about with fine 
twine. Dip in a frying batter or in the white of an egg and 
fry in deep hot fat. Garnish with sprigs of parsley and serve 
hot. If mushrooms are not at hand, a little catsup may be used 
instead. 

Chicken a la Marengo 

Singe, wash, and dry thoroughly two good-sized fat and 
tender chickens. Cut them up as for fricassee. Put the pieces 
in a pan with two ounces of butter and one gill of olive oil, 
salt, white pepper, a dash of cayenne, and a little grated nut- 
meg. Fry over a brisk fire until slightly brown on both sides. 
Drain off part of the fat, add a tablespoonful of chopped shal- 
lots, one-fourth cup sliced mushrooms, and a bruised clove of 
garlic. Fry three minutes longer, then stir in half a pint of 



POULTRY AND GAME 183 

tomato sauce, half a pint of Espagnole sauce, two wine-glasses 
of Sherry, and a little broth. Cover and let all simmer gently 
for fifteen minutes. Dish in pyramid form. Fry separately, in 
very hot sweet oil, eight eggs, a delicate brown and soft. Drain 
them on cloth, place them round the chicken, and serve. 

Poulade a la Royale 

Drain, singe, and bone a nice young fowl and stuff it with the 
following forcemeat : One sweetbread minced fine and rubbed 
through a sieve. Two ounces of raw veal also rubbed through 
a sieve, two ounces of raw ham also rubbed through a sieve, four 
mushrooms pounded well and put through a sieve. Put all in 
a mortar and pound to a pulp. Mix with the whites of two eggs. 

Make a sauce of the following : Melt one ounce of butter 
in saucepan, add a teaspoonful of chopped onion and let it 
boil for two minutes, then add one ounce of flour and let it 
come to a boil. Add half a pint of chicken broth, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, a pinch 
of cayenne. Let it boil five minutes. Whip the yolks of two 
eggs with two tablespoonfuls of cream. Put the sauce in a 
double boiler, add eggs and cream. Do not let it boil, but 
continue stirring until it gets thick. Remove at once and set 
away to cool. When cold, add it to the forcemeat. Draw 
inside the legs and wings of the fowl, put the forcemeat in the 
centre of it, sew up the back, giving it its full shape and allow- 
ing room for the forcemeat to swell. Put the fowl in a kettle 
and braise it one hour. Then put it in the oven to brown. Serve 
with a puree of chestnuts in a plain border or in rosettes round 
the dish. Also serve a rich brown sauce with it. 

Fricassee a la Dauphine 

Prepare and cook a chicken for a fricassee. Trim the pieces 
and place them on a dish. Reduce the stock or sauce to the 
consistency of Allemande sauce, add a liaison of four eggs, 



184 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

butter, and cream. When this is thoroughly mixed, strain it 
through a wet cloth. Dip each of the pieces of chicken in it 
and replace them on the dish. When the sauce has become 
set, roll the pieces in fine bread crumbs, then in beaten egg, 
and again in fine bread crumbs. Arrange in frying basket and 
fry in deep hot lard until a light brown. When done, drain 
on brown paper. Arrange them on a napkin. Garnish with 
fried parsley. Serve with white Italienne sauce in a separate 
dish, or else arrange on a platter without the napkin and pour 
Bechamel or Allemande sauce over them. 

Chicken Curry 

Select a tender chicken weighing about three or four pounds. 
After singeing and cleaning, wash well and soak it in cold water 
for ten minutes. Drain and cut into square pieces. Put the 
pieces into a saucepan with enough hot water to cover them. 
Add two pinches of salt, one of white pepper, a little grated 
nutmeg, a bouquet, and six small, white onions. Cook over a 
moderate fire for forty-five minutes, keeping it well skimmed. 
Drain off the broth and set the saucepan where the chicken 
will keep warm. Put half a pint of white sauce — butter and 
flour — in a saucepan with all the broth and mix thoroughly. 
Take one tablespoonful of curry which is blended with water, 
the yolks of four eggs, and the juice of half a lemon. Beat all 
together thoroughly and gradually stir it into the sauce. Do 
not let it boil. Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve 
immediately. Garnish the dish with a border of boiled rice. 

Boned Broiled Chicken with Mushroom Sauce 

Bone three young chickens, each weighing one and one-half 
pounds. Season with salt, pepper, and a little lemon juice, 
and put in a cool place until wanted. Peel one pound of 
mushrooms and quarter them. Make a sauce of the following: 
Melt one tablespoonful of butter, add one tablespoonful of

POULTRY AND GAME 185 

flour, and let the mixture come to a boil, and then add half a 
pint of clear, rich consomme. When it boils, add mushrooms; 
let them simmer five minutes, and then add half a cup of rich 
cream. Broil your chickens, brush them over with melted 
butter, and set them in a pan in the oven to keep hot. Have 
some nice pieces of toast, cut the chickens in halves, and put 
them on the toast around the platter. Put the mushrooms and 
sauce in the centre. Serve very hot. Garnish with parsley. 

Fricassee of Chicken with Mushrooms 

Select two good-sized plump chickens. After they have 
been drawn, singe them and cut them up in small members or 
joints in the following manner: First remove the wings at the 
second joint and the legs at the knotty bend of the first joint; 
then take hold of the chicken with the left hand, and, with a 
sharp knife in the right, make two parallel cuts lengthwise on 
the back about an inch and a half apart, so as partly to detach, 
or at least mark out where the legs and wings are to be 
removed; cut both legs and fillets, then remove the thigh bone; 
separate the back and breast, trim these, then cut the back 
across in two pieces. Steep the pieces in a pan of tepid water 
for ten or fifteen minutes. Occasionally squeeze each piece, so 
as to extract the blood. Next sprinkle the bottom of a sauce- 
pan with thin slices of onion and carrot, a little celery, three 
cloves, twelve peppercorns, a blade of mace, and a bouquet. 
Place the pieces of chicken in close and neat order upon the 
vegetables. Moisten with a quart of boiling broth — if not at 
hand, water will do. Let them boil gently for half an hour, 
or until sufficiently tender. Keep the pan covered, so they 
will steam as well as boil. Remove the pieces with a skimmer, 
drain, and then plunge in cold water. Wash and drain them 
upon a cloth. Trim and place them in a saucepan and set 
away in a cool place. Strain the broth the chickens were 
cooked in. Melt two ounces of butter in saucepan and stir in 



186 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

two ounces of flour. Stir over the fire for three minutes, but 
do not let it brown. Remove from the range and stir in the 
chicken broth. Mix together until it is a smooth sauce. Add 
the mushroom trimmings, that is, the stems. Stir the sauce 
over the fire until it boils, then set it where it will boil slowly 
for half an hour. When it has boiled the full length of time, 
skim it thoroughly, and then continue boiling until it becomes 
the proper thickness. Then stir into it a liaison of four eggs, 
mixed with a little butter and a little cream. In making a 
liaison, you use twice as much water as you have egg yolks — 
the butter keeps it from curdling the sauce. Stir over the fire 
until it nearly boils, then strain it through a wet cloth. Pour 
over the chicken which is in the saucepan and add half a 
bottle of button mushrooms. Heat thoroughly, but do not let 
it boil. Dish it up as follows: First, put the pieces of the 
back in the centre of the dish, place the legs at the angles, the 
bones pointed inwardly. Next place the fillets upon these, then 
set the pieces of breast on top. Pour the sauce over the 
chicken. Arrange the mushrooms in groups, and surround all 
with eight or ten glazed croutons. 

Boiled Chicken and Tongue 

Draw and truss two young chickens and rub them thor- 
oughly with the juice of one lemon. Tie two or three slices of 
fat pork or bacon over the breast and wrap them up in a 
nicely floured cloth. Place them in a stewpan with one quart 
of consomme. Bring them to a boil and then let them simmer 
gently until done. Do not let them boil any longer than is 
necessary. To test: Try the wings with a fork. Let them 
stand in the pot for fifteen minutes. Have a nice beef tongue 
boiled tender. Let this also stand in its liquor. Have some 
fine spinach rubbed through a puree sieve, seasoned well with 
pepper, salt, butter, and two tablespoonfuls of cream. Heat it 
thoroughly and let it stand in the saucepan. Set your boiled 



POULTRY AND GAME 187 

fowl in the centre of a platter and put the spinach around it. 
Cut the tongue in the shape of cutlets and lay the pieces on 
top of the spinach around the platter. Make a sauce of the 
stock in which the chicken was cooked. To make the sauce, 
melt one tablespoonful of butter. When it comes to a boil, 
add one tablespoonful of flour. Let this come to a boil and 
then add one cup and a half of stock. Boil five minutes, 
season to taste, and add one glass of Madeira wine. Pour 
some of the sauce over the chicken. Serve the rest in a sauce- 
boat. The chickens may be carved before you dish them, 
placing them together on the platter, or they may be sent to 
the table whole. 

Creamed Chicken 

Clean and cut up in neat pieces two chickens or fowls. 
Put them on to boil. Before they are done, pare enough pota- 
toes to go nicely with the chickens. Cut them in pieces not 
more than two and a half inches in diameter, lay them on the 
chicken, and let them boil until done. Then take up the pota- 
toes in a dish by themselves. Pour a pint (or, if wished, more) 
of sweet cream over the chickens. Let it heat and then 
thicken with a scant tablespoonful of flour dissolved in a small 
half cup of milk. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and fresh 
butter. If the cream is not rich, more butter will be required. 

Chicken Canape's 

Cut the meat of a cold chicken in pieces as for chicken 
salad. Heat in a double boiler a cup and a half of rich milk 
and in this stir a tablespoonful of corn-starch, rubbed smooth, 
with the same quantity of butter, half a teaspoon of minced 
onion and of minced parsley, and salt and white pepper to 
taste. In this sauce simmer the chicken about ten minutes, 
and serve on slices of bread toasted or fried in hot fat, or 
dipped in butter and browned in the oven. Stick in each bit 
of bread a tree or two of parsley.

Walled Chicken 

This dish is made of one large fowl, or two rather small 
ones, eight medium-sized potatoes, two eggs, four tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, half a cupful of hot milk, three cups of chicken 
stock, — the water in which the chicken was boiled, — one table- 
spoonful of finely chopped onion, one sprig of parsley, one slice 
of carrot, one bay leaf, two generous tablespoonfuls of flour, 
salt and pepper to suit the taste. It is best to boil the fowl 
the day before it is to be used. In doing this, clean it and put 
it in a saucepan, breast down. Cover with boiling water. 
When it commences to boil, skim it, and set the kettle back on 
the stove where the chicken will simply simmer until tender — 
from two hours and a half to three hours. Set the fowl away 
to cool in the water in which it was boiled. When cool, free 
it from skin and bone, and cut it in pieces suitable for serving. 
Season with salt and white pepper. Fifty minutes before 
serving time peel the potatoes, put in a saucepan, and cover 
them with boiling water. When they have been cooking for 
fifteen minutes, prepare the chicken in the following manner : 
Put three tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying pan with the 
vegetables and herbs. Cook slowly for five minutes, then add 
the flour. Stir until smooth and frothy, but not long enough to 
permit it to get brown. Gradually add the cold chicken stock, 
stirring all the time. When the liquor boils up, add one-eighth 
of a teaspoonful of pepper and one teaspoonful of salt, and 
simmer for five minutes. Put the seasoned chicken in a sauce- 
pan, strain the sauce over it, cover and simmer for ten minutes, 
then set where it will keep hot until serving time. When the 
potatoes are cooked, pour off all the water. Place the milk in 
a saucepan on the range, mash the potatoes until smooth and 
light, then add the milk, one tablespoonful of butter, and a 
teaspoonful of salt. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff 
froth and stir into the mixture. Have a stone platter very 



POULTRY AND GAME 189 

hot, arrange the mashed potato as a border around the centre 

of the dish. Beat the yolks of the eggs with two tablespoon- 

fuls of water. Spread it over the potato and place in the oven 

for ten minutes. At the end of that time pour the chicken 

into the centre of the border. Garnish with bits of parsley. 

Any kind of cold meat, poultry, game, or fish may be served 

in this manner. 

Jellied Chicken 

Select a chicken or fowl weighing three pounds after it has 
been cleaned. Also have one-third of a box of gelatine, one 
slice of onion, one slice of carrot, one bay leaf, one whole clove, 
some hot and cold water, and salt and pepper in quantities to 
be determined by one's own taste. Wash the fowl, put it into 
a deep stewpan with boiling water to cover it. Let the water 
again come to a boil, then skim carefully, and set the pan where 
the water will only bubble until the meat becomes tender. 
When the fowl becomes tender, take it from the water and set 
away to cool ; also set the water where it will cool. Soak the 
gelatine in one gill of cold water for two hours. When the 
chicken liquor has become cold, skim it and pour one pint and 
a half of it in a saucepan with the clove, carrot, onion, and bay 
leaf. Let them simmer for ten minutes, then add a grain of 
cayenne and a level spoonful of salt and the soaked gelatine. 
After straining this liquid through a cloth, pour a thin layer 
into a mould, and set away to harden. Free the cold fowl of 
skin, fat, and bones, and cut in thin strips, season well with 
salt and pepper, lay them in the mould. When the jelly 
hardens, pour the liquid jelly over the meat and again set the 
mould away. At serving time, dip it in warm water and turn 
out on a flat dish. Jellied chicken may be made of the remains 
of cold roast chicken or turkey or boiled fowl. When there is 
no stock on hand, the bones of the chicken should be covered 
with water and simmered for several hours in order to obtain a 
supply. 



190 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Pressed Chicken 

Singe and clean a medium-sized chicken. Disjoint it and 
put it in a saucepan with hardly enough water to cover it. Boil 
until the meat slips away from the bones and the gristly parts 
are soft. While hot, remove the skin and separate the meat 
into medium-sized pieces. Mix the white and dark meat to- 
gether. Skim the grease from the broth the chicken was boiled 
in. Season with salt, white pepper, lemon juice, and celery salt. 
Boil until it is reduced one-half. Strain to free it from the bones, 
and mix with the meat. Butter a mould and decorate the 
bottom and sides with hard-boiled egg and thin slices of lemon. 
Pack the meat, press it down, and put weight on top. Keep in 
a cold place until wanted. Unmould and serve with a garnish 
of quartered lemons and parsley. 

Galantine of Chicken 

Clean and split a nice chicken down the back, bone it, and 
remove the legs and wings. Spread it flat on the table and fill 
with the following forcemeat: Take one pound of fat fresh pork 
and two pounds of veal and the meat from the chicken legs and 
wings. Scrape and pound in a mortar, then rub through a 
puree sieve. Add the whites of two eggs and season with salt, 
white pepper, and a little grated nutmeg. Have at hand some 
nice thin strips of bacon, the same length as the chicken ; also 
have boiled tongue cut in the same manner, and some truffles 
cut in small pieces. Spread the chicken with a layer of force- 
meat, then a layer of bacon, and then a layer of tongue. Sprinkle 
with pieces of truffle. "When the chicken is refilled, fold it and 
sew up the back. Wrap it in a clean cloth and tie at both ends. 
Place in a pan and cover with good stock. Add two carrots, 
two onions, a little celery, and a little thyme; also the bones of 
the chicken. Boil slowly for two hours and let it cool in the 
stock. Take three pints of the stock the chicken was cooked in, 



poultry and game 191 

add one box of Cox's gelatine which has previously been dis- 
solved, and one egg. Mix thoroughly and stir over the fire 
until it comes to a boil. Strain through a wet cloth. Cover 
the bottom of a mould with the liquid. When it becomes hard, 
garnish with egg and truffles cut in fancy shapes, then place 
the chicken in the mould, pour in a little more of the liquid. 
"When the chicken is firm, fill the mould and place on ice until 
served. Unmould on a dish and garnish with the jelly cut in 
small dice or chopped. 

Terrapin Chicken 

Cut one quart of cold cooked chicken in very small pieces 
and mix with two chicken livers and three hard-boiled eggs 
chopped rather coarse. Sprinkle all with one level teaspoonful 
of salt, one-third of a teaspoonful of pepper, and a dash of grated 
nutmeg. Put three tablespoonf uls of butter in a pan. After it 
has melted, add two tablespoonfuls of flour and stir until the 
mixture is smooth. Set the pan where there is less heat and 
gradually add one cupful of chicken stock. Place it over a 
quick fire and stir constantly for three or four minutes. Then 
from one cupful of cream remove four tablespoonfuls, stir the 
rest into the mixture. Then add the chicken, etc., and cook all 
together slowly for ten minutes. Beat the yolks of two eggs, 
add the four tablespoonfuls of cream, and stir into the saucepan. 
Stir for a minute. At the end of that time remove the pan from 
the fire, stir in four tablespoonfuls of Sherry and one table- 
spoonful of lemon juice. Mix thoroughly and serve at once. 

Chicken and Rice Pie 

Select a fowl weighing about five pounds. Clean and wash 
it thoroughly. Cut into joints and put in a stewpan with 
three pints of boiling water, one slice of onion, one slice of 
carrot, and two whole cloves. Let it simmer until tender. It 
ought to cook tender in one hour and a half if you select a 



192 MBS. seely's cook book 

young fowl. If it is tough, it may take three hours before it 

cooks tender. When it is cooked, add one-half teaspoonful 

of white pepper and two teaspoonfuls of salt. Set aside until 

time for cooking with rice. Wash and pick over one cup and 

a half of rice. Drain and put it on to cook with three quarts 

of boiling water. When it has been cooked for ten minutes 

add two level teaspoonfuls of salt. Cook ten minutes longer, 

and then turn into a colander, and drain thoroughly. Then 

mix it with one teaspoonful more of salt, two well-beaten eggs, 

half a cupful of butter, and half a pint of milk. Place in a deep 

baking dish a layer of chicken, then a layer of rice mixture, then 

of chicken, and so on, finishing with the rice. Cover the rice 

with one pint of the stock the chicken was boiled in. Bake in 

a moderate oven for half an hour. Serve in the dish it was 

baked in. 

Chicken Pie 

Singe and clean a chicken weighing about four or four and 
one-half pounds. Cut into twelve pieces. Cover with water 
and let them soak for thirty minutes. Wash, drain, and cover 
with water, season with salt and white pepper, a bunch of pars- 
ley, six small onions, and five ounces of salt pork cut in small 
squares. Cook for three-quarters of an hour. Skim often. 
Stir in one pint of raw potato cut in pieces and four scant 
tablespoonfuls of flour blended with cold water. Stir con- 
stantly until it boils, then cook it for ten minutes. Remove 
the bunch of parsley. Place the rest in a deep baking dish, 
moisten the edges with water, cover the top with pastry — 
some prefer the puff paste. Brush over with a beaten egg. 
Cut a hole in the centre. Bake in brisk oven for twenty 
minutes or until the pastry is done.

POULTRY AND GAME 193 

the work into three parts. To make the forcemeat use the 
white meat of four medium-sized uncooked chickens, one pint 
of cream, one-half pint of stale bread crumbs, free of crust, six 
tablespoonfuls of butter, one blade of mace, one tablespoonful 
of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of white pepper, and the 
whites of four eggs. Chop the chicken meat fine, put it in a 
mortar, and pound it fine, then rub it through a puree sieve. 
There should be one pint of the prepared meat. Mix the bread, 
cream, and mace together. Cook slowly for twenty minutes. 
Then remove the mace, and with a spoon work the bread and 
cream to a smooth paste. Add the butter, salt, pepper, and 
meat, and finally add the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth. Beat the mixture until it is thoroughly blended. Then 
set away to cool. To make the filling use three gills of cream, 
one pint of cooked chicken cut in small cubes, four tablespoon- 
fuls of chopped mushrooms, one tablespoonful of flour, one heap- 
ing teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of white 
pepper, and one tablespoonful of chopped truffles. Reserve half 
a cup of cream. Put the rest on to boil. Blend the flour with 
the half cup of cream and stir into the boiling cream. Boil for 
one minute, then add the chicken and other ingredients. Cook 
for three minutes longer. If desired, flavor with a few drops of 
onion juice. Butter the mould or moulds, and after dotting 
the bottom and sides with pieces of truffle, line them with the 
forcemeat, being careful to have every part well covered. The 
side near the rim will require as thick a covering as any part 
of the mould. Now almost fill the mould or moulds with the 
chicken preparation and cover with the forcemeat, being care- 
ful to put in only a little at a time, and always work from the 
outer edge until the centre is reached. Be careful to have the 
top smooth. If at all round it will not be steady when turned 
on a dish. Place the mould in a deep pan. Pour in enough 
warm water to come almost to the rim. Cover the mould with 
buttered paper and bake in a moderate oven for twenty-five 



194 MBS. seely's cook book 

minutes. It must cook slowly. When quite firm to the touch, 
turn on a hot dish and serve with Bechamel sauce. 

Timbale a la Hyde 
Boil a young fowl, take off the meat, and cut it in pieces. Take 
two ounces of Parmesan cheese grated, one small shallot chopped 
fine, pepper and salt, and make about half a pint of good rich 
white sauce with cream and consomme, and mix with the chicken 
and cheese. Add a little well-cooked and drained small maca- 
roni and two sliced tomatoes. Line a mould with good paste 
(six ounces of butter to eight ounces of flour or trimmings of 
puff paste will do), put the mixture in, fold the paste over the 
top, put a flat weight on, and bake about one hour. Serve with 
good rich brown or white sauce. 

Chicken a, la Parisienne 

Use the fillets of four chickens, one small can of truffles, one 
can of mushrooms, eight thin slices of red tongue, the white of 
one egg, one pint of consomme, half a cupful of clarified butter, 
one gill of glaze, one tablespoonful of salt, one pint of supreme 
sauce, and one pint and a half of chicken liver forcemeat. Fillet 
the chickens and separate the under fillets from the large ones. 
Curve them all the same way. Pour three tablespoonfuls of 
clarified butter into a frying pan and arrange the large fillets 
in the butter, having the smooth side up, and curving them all 
the same way. Sprinkle them with salt. Arrange the under 
fillets in another pan with clarified butter the same way as the 
larger ones. Cut two or three truffles in thin slices and with 
small fancy vegetable cutters stamp out stars and various shapes. 
Beat the white of the egg until well broken, but not light. 
Brush a little on each of the large fillets and decorate them 
with the fancy shapes of truffles. When all are done, brush 
lightly with the white of the egg. Let this dry. Cover with 
a sheet of buttered paper and set in cool place until time for 



POULTRY AND GAME 195 

cooking. Treat the small fillets in the same way, using red 
tongue in place of truffles. Put the liver forcemeat in a small 
and plain buttered border mould. Set it in cool place until 
time for cooking. Cut seven slices of tongue in fillet shape. 
Put these in a cool place. Make some supreme sauce. Open 
the mushrooms. Chop the remainder of the truffles rather fine. 
Half an hour before serving put the mould of forcemeat into a 
pan with water two-thirds as high as the mould. Cover with 
buttered paper and place in a moderate oven. In ten minutes 
open the oven door. Take the paper from the fillets and baste 
them with three or four tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Re- 
place the papers, arrange in pans, and place in oven with the 
forcemeat. Cook twenty minutes, leaving the oven door open. 
While these are cooking put the pieces of tongue into a small 
stewpan with half the glaze and half a gill of consomme. Cook 
for ten minutes. Reserve one gill of the supreme sauce and mix 
the chopped truffles with the remainder. Strain the liquid from 
mushrooms, add them to the sauce. Drain the butter from the 
fillets. Remove the papers and pour half of the reserved supreme 
sauce over each pan of fillets. Cook this on top of the stove for 
four minutes. Do not let it boil. While this is cooking turn 
the border of forcemeat on a flat dish. Pour the consomme 
from the pieces of tongue. Add the remainder of the glaze 
to them. Arrange the large fillets and the tongue alternately 
around the border of forcemeat. Pour the mushrooms and sauce 
in the centre and arrange the under fillets on top. Serve at once. 

Eoast Capon with Truffles 

Select a nice, meaty capon, singe and clean it, and fill it with 
truffles prepared as follows : Peel, slice, and remove the stringy 
part from one quart of truffles. Let them stand in their own 
juice. Melt one pound of butter with salt and pepper, three 
bay leaves, two sliced shallots, a clove of garlic, and a sprig of 
thyme. Stir while the butter is melting. Rub through a col- 



196 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

ander over the truffles. Mix them and let them stand until 
thoroughly cold. Fill the capon, make it a good shape, and 
sew both ends so the truffles will not come out. Cover with 
thin strips of larding pork. Wrap in a thick sheet of white 
paper which is well oiled, and bake in an oven for one hour and 
a half. Baste frequently with melted butter. Remove paper 
and pork. Serve with a gravy made of the strained liquid the 
capon was cooked in and a little broth. 

Descaides, a Jewish Dish 

Take the livers of chickens or any other poultry and stew 
them gently in a little good gravy seasoned with a little onion, 
mushrooms, pepper, and salt. When the livers are tender, mince 
them on a pasteboard or in a mortar. Return them to the 
saucepan and stir in the yolks of one or two eggs, according 
to the quantity of liver. By the time the mixture is thick 
have rounds of toast ready on a hot dish and serve the minced 
liver upon the toast. Garnish with parsley. 

Chicken Liver Cromeskies 

Cut the chicken livers in two and season with salt and pep- 
per. Fold each piece of liver in a slice of bacon, cut very thin. 
Fasten with a small skewer and broil over a good fire for ten 
or fifteen minutes. Serve hot on a piece of hot toast after draw- 
ing out the skewers. 

Calf's liver may be cooked the same way if it is especially 
delicate and tender. 

Roast Turkey with Oysters 

Singe and clean a medium-sized tender turkey, wipe dry, 
and stuff with the following mixture : Four breakfast cupfuls of 
oyster cracker crumbs mixed with four breakfast cupfuls of bread 
crumbs. Stir in the liquor from five dozen oysters, one-half 
pound of melted butter, and two beaten eggs. Put in the oys-

POULTRY AND GAME 197 

ters, season to taste, and stuff the turkey. Put the mixture in 
loosely so it will absorb the gravy. Wrap the turkey in a piece 
of heavy white buttered paper and roast in a hot oven. Baste 
it often with melted butter. About ten minutes before remov- 
ing the bird from the oven take off the paper, sprinkle with 
flour and salt, and baste with butter to brown it. When cooked, 
place it on a hot dish. Prepare some brown sauce with the 
liquid in the dripping pan. Pour some around the turkey and 
serve the rest in a separate dish. 

Scalloped Turkey- 
Remove all the meat from a cooked turkey, and chop it very 
fine. Break up the frame and bones, and add the fat, skin, etc., 
and cover with cold water. Cook down slowly. Butter the 
inside of a deep baking dish, put in a layer of fine bread 
crumbs, then a layer of turkey, then some bits of butter and 
bits of the turkey dressing, if you have any, then another layer 
of bread crumbs, and so on until all is used. When you think 
the bones have boiled enough, strain, and thicken with browned 
flour and season to taste. Pour some into the dish. Then 
thickly spread fine bread crumbs moistened to a thick paste 
with the gravy over the entire dish. Cover with another dish, 
and bake for thirty minutes. Remove the extra dish, and when 
the top is a nice brown, serve. 

Devilled Turkey Legs 

Score and trim cooked turkey legs. Season them with salt 
and pepper. Rub them with some mustard and oil mixed to a 
paste. Broil over a clear fire. Turn often. When a nice 
brown, serve with a rich brown gravy poured over them.

three-quarters of an hour in enough stock to cover them. Drain, 
and cut them the same size as the liver, trimming off all the 
hard skin. Season them with salt and black pepper, finely 
chopped parsley, and moisten all with a little olive oil. Have 
ready as many squares of bacon as you have giblets. Wrap 
the giblets in the bacon. Put them on skewers one after the 
other, roll them in finely grated bread crumbs, put them on a 
gridiron, and broil over a bright fire. Turn them often. When 
nicely browned, put the skewers on a folded napkin on a dish 
and serve at once. 

Timbale of Turkey Livers with Bread Mixture 

Clean and wash eight or nine turkey livers, put them in a 
pan with one-half pound of fat pork sliced thin, a little salt 
and pepper, two or three blades of mace, small tied bunch of 
parsley, two or three finely chopped shallots, and three ounces 
of butter. Fry carefully over a hot fire until the livers are 
quite firm. Add one glass of Sherry and cook until nearly dry. 
Remove the parsley and let the livers, etc., cool. Then pound 
them in a mortar with one-third of the quantity of bread mixture

Boast Goose stuffed with Chestnuts 

Select a tender goose weighing about five pounds. Singe, 
draw thoroughly, wash and dry. Stuff it with chestnuts pre- 
pared as follows : Chop one shallot very fine and put it in a 
saucepan with two scant tablespoonfuls of butter. Cook for 
two or three minutes. Then add one-quarter of a pound of 
sausage meat. Cook five minutes. Then add twelve finely 
chopped mushrooms and twelve cooked chestnuts which have 
been peeled and pounded in a mortar. Add one pinch of salt, 
one-half pinch of white pepper, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of 
powdered thyme, and a teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley. 
Let all come to a boil and add one ounce of fresh bread crumbs 
and twenty-four French chestnuts cooked, shelled, and whole. 
Mix thoroughly, being careful to keep the chestnuts whole. 
When cold, stuff the goose with this mixture. Sew both ends, 
truss, and wrap in heavy white buttered paper. Roast in mod- 
erate oven for one hour and a half. Baste with the drippings, 
dress on a hot platter. Skim the fat from the drippings, add one 
gill of white broth. Let it come to a boil. Strain into a sauce- 
boat and serve. Also serve apple sauce with the above. 

Baked Wild Goose 

Clean and prepare the goose as for roasting and soak it in 
salted water for five or six hours. Cut an onion in pieces, not 
too small, and put in the inside of the goose. Sew it up and 



200 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

place in pan of boiling water. Let it boil twenty minutes. 
Take it out, remove the onion, and stuff it with the following 
forcemeat : One cup and a half of mashed potatoes, a small 
head of celery chopped fine, four hard-boiled eggs, and half a 
pound of salt pork also chopped very fine. One small grated 
turnip, a little chopped onion, a tablespoonful of salt, one of 
vinegar, and a little pepper. Moisten the mixture slightly and 
stir together thoroughly. Sew up the opening, truss the goose, 
and place it in a pan with a teacupful of stock. Brush it over 
with melted butter, cover with greased paper, and bake in 
moderate oven. When cooked, place it on platter and pour a 
little mushroom sauce or celery sauce around it. 

Roast Canvasback Duck 

Select a fat canvasback duck. Singe, clean, and wipe 
thoroughly. Rub inside lightly with a little salt. Press in the 
head from the end to the back. Truss it securely. Sprinkle 
with a little salt and roast in a brisk oven for eighteen minutes. 
Pour in the bird about two tablespoonfuls of white broth. 
Serve on a very hot dish with sliced fried hominy as a garnish. 
Serve currant jelly in a separate dish. The quicker the cook- 
ing the finer the flavor. Ducks should not be overcooked. 

Prepare redhead ducks and mallard the same way. 

Steamed Duck with Turnip 

Singe, wash, and dry two medium-sized tender ducks. Place 
in a pan with a little butter and roast in a hot oven for fifteen 
minutes or until brown. Leave them whole and put in casse- 
role or stewpan. Cut white turnip in strips one-half inch 
square and two inches long, measure three pints. Scald them 
with boiling water. Drain and spread them over the ducks, 
then season to taste with salt and white pepper. Pour in two 
cups of bouillon, cover securely, and steam in slow oven for two 



POULTRY AND GAME 201 

hours. Remove the duck to a platter. Skim off the grease 
and pour broth over the duck. Garnish with the turnip. 

Salmi of Duck 

Use two medium -sized cold roast ducks, one can of mush- 
rooms, sixteen stoned olives, one pint of Spanish sauce, one- 
half pint of clear stock, one gill of Sherry, one tablespoonful of 
lemon juice, one teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne, and twelve 
pieces of fried bread cut in triangles. Cut the duck into 
medium-sized pieces and place in a saucepan with the salt 
and pepper. Cover with the stock and let it come to the 
boiling-point. Then add the olives and mushrooms and boil 
for five minutes. Now add the Spanish sauce and cook until 
it comes to a boil. Then add the Sherry and lemon juice. 
Cook a minute or two. Arrange the duck in a mound on 
the dish. Surround it with a border of fried bread. Pour 
the sauce over the duck and serve very hot. This is enough 
for twelve people. 

Fillets of Ducklings 

Draw and singe some fat ducklings. Separate the breasts 
from the legs and backs by running the knife just above the 
thighs and cutting through the upper part of the back under 
the wings. Roast the backs and use them for making the 
bigarade sauce. Place the breasts in a deep earthen dish, 
season with coarse white pepper, salt, chopped parsley, bay leaf, 
thyme, the juice of one lemon, and three tablespoonfuls of salad 
oil. Let them soak for two or three hours. About three- 
quarters of an hour before dinner arrange the fillets on a skewer 
and place the seasoning over them. Cover with a big sheet of 
greased paper and cook in an oven for about twenty minutes. 
At the end of that time remove the paper and seasoning and 
brown them. Remove the fillets, trim them, and score them. 
Then put them in a saucepan with some of the sauce and allow

them barely to simmer until warmed through. Dish them in a 
close circle with a fried crouton of bread between each fillet. 
Pour the bigarade sauce over the entree and serve. 

Boast Quail 

After the desired number of quail have been cleaned, cut 
off the heads and feet, arrange the joints, and wrap each bird in 
a piece of larding pork. Place them in a saucepan just large 
enough to accommodate them. They must be packed tightly 
side by side. Cover them with boiling water. Sprinkle in 
some salt and white pepper. Place them over a hot fire for 
five or ten minutes. Remove the pork and dry each bird with 
a cloth. Rub them thoroughly with butter and roast them 
until a nice brown in a very hot oven. Baste two or three 
times with a little melted butter. Take the liquor in which 
they were boiled, strain it, and mix with an equal quantity of 
melted currant jelly. Serve in separate dish. Also serve cold 
currant jelly. Serve the birds when they are very hot. 

Quail a la Royale 

Bone eight quail, stuff them with chicken liver forcemeat, 
and truss them in the usual way. Place them in a stewpan 
with a few slices of carrot, an onion with two cloves stuck in it, 
and a bouquet. Add one pint of white broth, cover with a 
buttered paper, put the lid on, and let them cook slowly at the 
side of range for about three-quarters of an hour. Leave them 
in their liquor until they are partially cooled. Then remove 
them and set away to become cold. When cold remove the 
strings and roll each bird in bread crumbs, then in beaten egg, 
and then again in bread crumbs. A short time before serving 
place them in a frying basket and plunge in hot lard. Fry 
until a delicate brown. Serve on hot platter. Pour Allemande 
sauce around them.

Quail with Stewed Peas 
Clean and truss eight quail in the same manner chickens are 
trussed for boiling. Place them in a stewpan with half a pound 
of bacon streaked fat and lean, a bouquet in the centre. Cover 
with thin layers of fat bacon and moisten with good stock 
seasoned with Sherry wine. Let them stew gently for three- 
quarters of an hour. Prepare one pint of stewed peas, mix 
them with a little of the quail stock reduced to a glaze. Arrange 
the quail in a circle with their breasts placed outwards and a 
thin slice of bacon between each one. Fill the centre with the 
stewed peas. Mix a little of the quail stock with Espagnole 
sauce, pour it around and over the quail, and serve. 

Pigeon Pie 
Arrange thin slices of sirloin beef in the bottom of a deep, 
flat-edged earthen baking dish. Season with salt and pepper, 
some herbs, chopped fine, and one ladle of Espagnole sauce. 
Split in two pieces, four or more squabs, trim and flatten them, 
season, and arrange over the beef with more fine herbs, six 
sliced hard-boiled eggs, and one ladleful of Espagnole sauce. 
Wet the edge of the dish, lay an inch wide fiat rim of puff 
paste on it, wet again, and cover the whole with a large thin 
piece of paste, and trim and press the edges. Brush the surface 
with egg, make a few incisions, and cut a hole in the centre. 
Bake in a moderate oven for one hour, pour a little Espagnole 
sauce through the hole, and serve hot.

Partridges a, la Malaga 

Clean and truss four or six partridges as for boiling, and 
fry them in four ounces of fresh butter until they are a light 
brown. Remove and set aside on a plate. Have at hand one 
pound of ham that has been soaked and parboiled and cut it in 
small pieces about the size of an olive. Have also ready twenty- 
four small pieces of the red part of a carrot cut with a small 
scoop and also as many very small onions. Fry the ham and 
vegetables until they are a light brown. Remove them and 
mix with the partridge in another stewpan. Add a bouquet, a 
little salt, a dash of cayenne pepper, two good glasses of Madeira 
or Sherry wine, and one tablespoonful of thin tomato sauce. 
Cover and set the stewpan where the contents will simmer 
slowly for three-quarters of an hour. The liquid should be 
reduced about one-half. When the partridges are cooked, dish 
them in a triangular form. Skim the grease from the liquid and 
vegetables, add a tablespoon of Espagnole sauce, and the juice 
of half a lemon. Boil all together for two minutes. Place the 
ham, carrots, and onions in separate groups around the partridges. 
Strain the sauce through a wet cloth. Pour it over the par- 
tridges and serve. The centre of dish may be filled with boiled 
peas. 

Fillets of Partridge a la Jardiniere 

Fillet three partridges and separate the under fillets from 
the larger ones. Season with salt and pepper. Then dip them 
in a mixture consisting of one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, 
one tablespoonful of lemon juice, and half a cup of melted but- 
ter. Let the butter cool on them, dip them in two well-beaten 
eggs, then in fine bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat. The large 
fillets ought to cook in six minutes, and the small ones in four 
minutes. Drain them on brown paper. Arrange vegetables a la 
Jardiniere in the centre of a large dish. Rest the fillets against 
them, and pour Bechamel sauce around the base. Serve very hot. 



POULTRY AND GAME 205 

Fillet of Grouse 

Fillet of grouse may be prepared the same way as fillet of 
partridge. All the small birds may be filleted in the same 
way, but the time of cooking is only two-thirds as long as for 
the large ones. 

Prairie Chicken Fricassee 

Follow the directions for chicken fricassee or for creamed 
chicken. A sauce may be made to stir in the fricassee by tak- 
ing a little of the liquor in which the chicken is boiled, cooking 
in it minced or sliced mushrooms, adding a bit of butter, salt, 
and pepper, and stirring in fine before serving. 

Prairie Chicken Roasted 

After preparing the bird for cooking, truss it, and bind it 
with thin slices of fat salt pork. Baste it often while baking 
in a quick oven. The flesh will be dry if it is not well basted. 
The basting liquid should be of water in the bottom of the pan, 
a lump of butter, pepper and salt, the juice of half a lemon. 
When serving remove the pork, tie paper frills upon the leg 
bones, lay the chicken in a bed of parsley, and let it be well wet 
with the liquid in which it is cooked. 

Roast Snipe or Woodcock 

Draw each bird neatly and fill in with a piece of bread and 
butter, well seasoned with pepper and salt. Round each bird 
fold a thin piece of pickled pork, fastening the blanket with the 
bill of the bird. Place them in a row in a porcelain dripping 
pan, and nearly cover with port wine. Cook half an hour, bast- 
ing frequently. Add a little butter if it is necessary in making 
the gravy in the pan, and serve the birds hot between two strips 
of bread toasted a light brown and buttered.

Boast Saddle of Venison with Sauce 

Trim and lard very finely a saddle of venison weighing about 
six pounds. Tie it around three or four times. Put it in a pan, 
and sprinkle one tablespoonful of salt over it, and spread one 
ounce of butter over. Roast in brisk oven for forty-five min- 
utes. Baste it often. Remove the string before placing it on 
a dish. Mix one-half glass of Sherry with one gill of white 
broth. PoUr into the drippings and let all come to a boil. 
Skim off the fat and strain over the venison. Serve with the 
following sauce in a separate dish : — 

One wine-glass of Sherry. Let it come to a boil. Then 
add one-half pint of currant jelly. Stir until thoroughly dis- 
solved, then add one gill of Espagnole sauce. Stir until it 
comes to a boil and serve very hot. 

Roast Belgian Hare 

After the hare is thoroughly dressed, let it soak for a couple 
of hours in a good brine. By this process you loosen the film 
and stringy skin that covers the flesh of the rabbit family. At 
the end of the two hours wipe the flesh dry and lard it with 
narrow strips of bacon, drawing the fat through the flesh of the 
hare in spaces of an inch apart. In your dripping pan — a por- 
celain-lined one is best, since you use an acid — put two table- 
spoons of butter, a little chopped bacon, and the hare slightly 
dredged with flour. As the flesh takes on a brown, pour over 
it a third of a cup of weak vinegar (if vinegar is very sour use 
less, and add water), and after this is well absorbed baste fre- 
quently with a half pint of cream which has been salted and 
peppered. Cook the hare until tender. Serve with sliced 
lemons and parsley.

How to make Glaze 
Boil one quart of rich consomme until it becomes a thick, 
gluelike substance. You should have about half a pint. A 
demiglaze is made with one quart of consomme, boiled down to 
one pint. The glaze gives a smooth, shiny surface to cooked 
meats. When used, it should be melted over a pan of boiling 
water and applied with a brush. 

Demiglaze Sauce 
One glassful — small — of mushroom liquor, one pint Espa- 
gnole sauce, one small glassful Madeira wine, one bouquet, one 
scant teaspoonful pepper. Remove the fat carefully and cook

of flour, stirring it over a gentle fire for ten or fifteen minutes. 
Then pour to it in small portions half a pint of rich veal broth 
or gravy, mixing the whole well as it is added and letting it 
boil up between each portion, for unless this is done the butter 
is apt to float on the surface. Simmer the sauce for a few 
minutes, then add salt, a dash of cayenne, three teaspoons of 
minced parsley, and the juice of a small lemon. 

Martinot Sauce for Fish 

Cook one tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour,

A delicious cream boiled dressing for salads that may be used 
where oil is not liked. Cream two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
add a teaspoonf ul each of salt and sugar, half a teaspoonf ul each 
of mustard and paprika, or a dash of cayenne in place of the 
latter. Put the yolks of two eggs slightly beaten in a double 
boiler, add slowly four tablespoonfuls of hot tarragon or plain 
vinegar, beating constantly until thick. Remove from fire, add 
the seasoned butter, beat thoroughly, and when perfectly cold, 
add three-quarters of a cup of whipped cream and serve.

desired amount. Stir constantly with a fork. Season with 



SALADS, SAUCES, AND ASPICS 223 

vinegar, salt, dash of cayenne, and lemon juice if desired. 
Should the dressing thicken too quickly, thin it with vinegar. 
Should it curdle, commence again with a little mustard paste, 
yolk of another egg, and gradually stir in the first mixture. 
Keep on ice until served. 

Mayonnaise Dressing 
Have at hand the yolks of two eggs, one-half a teaspoonful 
of salt, one-half an eggspoonful of mustard, and a little white 
pepper. Mix the yolks and mustard together with a fork, then 
add olive oil very slowly — not more than a few drops at a time. 
Keep stirring and adding the oil until the mixture becomes thick 
and creamy. Add salt, white pepper, and malt and tarragon 
vinegar — more malt than tarragon. The vinegar will serve to 
make it thin, so use it accordingly. Serve with lettuce, celery, 
tomatoes, etc. 

Union Club Dressing 

Have at hand two hard-boiled eggs, — very hard, — two pi- 
mento peppers, one-half a small onion, one small bunch of chives,

Cabbage Salad 
Pour a little boiling water in a saucepan, add one and a half 
cups of vinegar, two teaspoonfuls of granulated sugar, three 
tablespoons of cream, and one teaspoonful of Coleman's mus- 
tard. Mix well, adding salt and white pepper to taste. When 
the mixture comes to a boil, stir in the well-beaten yolks of three 
eggs. Set away to cool. Shave one head of cabbage in small 
strips. Soak in cold water to make it crisp. Dry thoroughly 
and mix with the dressing. 

White and Red Cabbage Salad 
Take a red cabbage and a white cabbage, and having well 
washed and drained them, shave in long, thin strips. Arrange 
the strips tastefully in a salad bowl, either in diameter strips or 
in tufts of red in a bed of white, and garnish to taste. 

A dressing good for the cabbage is made of the yolks of 
two hard-boiled eggs rubbed smooth with a teaspoon of mus- 
tard, a tablespoon of finely minced onion, an egg well beaten, 
and a teaspoon of sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Add a 
small cup of oil and vinegar to make it of the right sourness, 
and pour over the cabbage, which should be thoroughly cold. 
Serve at once. 

In making this salad the Germans sometimes boil the cab- 
bages for five minutes (in separate saucepans) and then put 
the cabbages in cold water till used. 

Cold Slaw 
Shave a head of cabbage in small strips, soak in cold water

Cold Slaw 

Shave or chop the cabbage (not too fine), and make the 
dressing as follows : Two eggs, a scant one-third of a cup of 
vinegar, one heaping teaspoon of salt, one heaping teaspoon 
of sugar, a little cayenne pepper. Stir all well together, add- 
ing the vinegar slowly and stirring all the time. Set the 
saucepan into another of hot water to thicken the dressing. 
Boil the water very slowly under it and stir constantly to pre- 
vent lumps. During the thickening raise the saucepan that 
contains the mixture from the water occasionally and stir and 
set it back. When the dressing is quite thick and smooth 
remove, and add a teaspoon of butter and cream. If wished, 
add a dessert or tablespoonful of olive oil. 

Cheese Salad 

To one cup of minced chicken add half a pound of soft 
tender American cheese and half a cup of pickled cauliflower 
chopped coarsely together. Rub soft the yolks of two hard- 
boiled eggs, add one teaspoon of French mustard, three table- 
spoons of vinegar, four tablespoons of oil or melted butter, and 
cayenne and salt to taste. Pour this sauce over the salad 
and garnish with the white of the egg cut in rings and 
branches of pickled cauliflower. 

Cream Cheese Salad 

Color the cream cheese a delicate green, using either the 
juice of boiled spinach or vegetable coloring, and form it in 
balls or eggs the size of a walnut. Take a flat salad dish 
and make nests of the tender leaves of lettuce, and in each 
nest put three or four eggs of the cheese. With these serve 
mayonnaise dressing and crisp salted biscuits or water 
crackers.

Chicken Salad 

Remove the meat from a chicken that has been boiled in 
salted water, and cut into pieces about one inch square. Wash 
and scrape some nice celery. Soak in cold water to make it 
crisp. Dry thoroughly and cut in pieces about the same size as 
the chicken. Have about three-quarters as much celery as you 
have chicken. Mix both together and make very moist and rich 
with a mayonnaise dressing. Arrange on dish, shape nicely, and 
cover with more dressing. Garnish and trim with white celery 
leaves, hard-boiled egg, and a few capers sprinkled over the top. 

Halibut Salad with Cucumber Spirals 
Halibut salad is an appetizing, warm weather dish for lunch- 
eon or Sunday night's supper. Steam a slice of halibut three 
inches thick. Its flavor is improved if a soup bunch is thrown 
into the steamer with it. It is done when tender enough to 
remove the skin and bone, which should be accomplished while 
it is still hot without disturbing the shape. Pour over it a 
French dressing made of four tablespoonfuls of olive oil, two 
of vinegar, with salt and pepper to taste. When cold arrange 
on a bed of lettuce hearts and fill the cavity from which the 
bone was taken with the best of them. 

This dish is prettily garnished with curls, spirals, or cups of 
cucumber, made as follows : Cut a cucumber crosswise in sec- 
tions three-quarters of an inch thick. Cut each section round 
and round in one long, thin paring. Mayonnaise dressing fills 
these cups, or is served with the fish in a separate sauce cup 
if the cucumbers are served in the usual way, that is, sliced 
with a French dressing. 

Lobster Salad 
Cut the meat of the lobster in pieces about one inch square. 
Place them in an earthen bowl and season with a French dress- 
ing of olive oil, vinegar, and a little salt and white pepper. 



SALADS, SAUCES, AND ASPICS 227 

Wash and thoroughly dry the white leaves of lettuce. Arrange 
on a flat dish in the form of shells. Drain the lobster and mix 
with enough mayonnaise dressing to make it rich and creamy. 
Fill each shell with it and pour a little mayonnaise on top of 
each one. Garnish the dish with lettuce leaves. 

Cold Meat and Potato Salad 
Cut one pound of cold meat into inch squares and mix with 
one pint of chopped, cold boiled potatoes. Put a layer in the 
bottom of a salad bowl, sprinkle with a little parsley, celery, 
and onion chopped very fine, and moisten with a salad dressing 
of oil, vinegar, salt, and white pepper. Then spread another 
layer of meat and potato, and so on till all is used. This dish 
should stand for two or three hours before serving. 

Oyster Salad 

Scald oysters until they are plump, and then put them in 
cold water while they are boiling hot, so as to make them firm. 
Put them to one side and boil five eggs hard. Take off the 
whites and chop very fine. Lay a bed of white lettuce in a 
long dish. Place the oysters in this. Cover the oysters with 
a mayonnaise dressing. Over them place the yolks of the 
eggs, which have been mashed very fine, and lastly the chopped 
whites of the eggs. Do not let it stand very long before serv- 
ing. If you do, the oysters and mayonnaise will become watery. 
Be sure the lettuce is thoroughly dried. 

Pineapple Salad 
Select a large, ripe pineapple, and after cutting off the top, 
remove the inside, leaving only the shell. Next remove the 
skin and seeds from a few grapes, then take two ripe bananas, 
skin them, and cut into small pieces. Also cut the pineapple 
and grapes in small pieces. Mix all with mayonnaise dressing, 
replace in the pine shell, and serve.

Russian Salad 

Cut in thin slices some cold salmon, chicken, and partridge. 
Arrange them in a dish and mix with them in small quantities 
some cooked turnips, carrots, cauliflower, and asparagus tops, 
— each vegetable cut in small pieces, — a few capers, shrimps, 
and a small portion of caviare. Make a dressing of mustard, 
oil, vinegar, a dash of cayenne, and one tablespoonful of 
minced shallots. Pour the mixture over the contents of salad 
dish and set on ice until served. This salad should be made 
so that each and every article can be tasted, but none should 
be pronounced. 

Aspic Jelly 

Soak one box of gelatine in half a pint of consomme for two 
hours. At the end of that time put one pint and a half over 
the fire. As soon as it reaches the boiling-point add, with the 
liquid gelatine, a gill of Madeira or Sherry wine, two table- 
spoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of lemon 
juice, and one teaspoonful of salt. Place the pan on a cool part 
of the range where it will cook slowly. Stir constantly for five 
minutes. Strain through a flannel bag or cloth. The jelly 
should be as clear as crystal. 

Aspic of Chicken 

Use half the rule for aspic jelly, one pint and a half of tender, 
cooked chicken free from skin, fat, and bones, and cut into dice, 
three slices of the red part of a cooked carrot, and three slices 
of cooked beet, the white of one hard-boiled egg, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and one-third of a teaspoonful of white pepper. 
Prepare the mould as for foie gras, but decorate it with beet, 
carrot, and the white of egg. When the layer of jelly which 
completely covers the vegetables is hard, season the chicken 
with salt and pepper and arrange it on the top, being careful 



SALADS, SAUCES, AND ASPICS 229 

to leave a space of about one-third of an inch between the 
chicken and the mould. With a spoon sprinkle a gill of the 
liquid jelly over the meat. Let it stand about half an hour to 
harden. At the end of that time pour the remainder of the 
jelly into the space between the chicken and the mould. Let 
it stand several hours. At serving time turn on a flat dish. 
If a border mould, fill in centre with celery salad, — may- 
onnaise and small pieces of celery. Be careful not to drop 
anything on the aspic. Garnish the border with sprays of 
white celery. 

Aspic de Foie Gras 

A small round or oval border mould is preferred, although 
any shape will do. Have at hand one of the smallest jars of 
foie gras, half the rule of aspic jelly, one truffle, and the white 
of one hard-boiled egg. Place the mould in a pan and surround 
it with cracked ice and a little water. Pour the liquid jelly 
into the mould to the depth of half an inch. Let this stand 
until it hardens. Then decorate it with the white of an egg 
and the truffle, which has been cut in thin slices and stamped 
with a fancy vegetable cutter. Moisten them with a little 
liquid jelly and let them stand about ten minutes so that the 
jelly may harden and hold them in place. Next, gently pour 
in another layer of jelly about one-quarter of an inch thick. 
Let this harden. Scrape all the fat from the foie gras. Dip 
it for half a minute in hot water. Wipe it dry and cut in thin 
slices, then in pieces about one inch square. Spread a layer of 
these over the congealed jelly. Cover with the liquid jelly and 
wait until it hardens before adding the second layer of foie 
gras. Continue until the mould is almost filled. Finish with 
a thin layer of liquid jelly. Set in cool place for three or four 
hours. Serve on a flat dish. If a border mould has been used, 
fill in the centre with Tartare sauce garnished with stuffed 
olives.

Aspic of Trout 
Clean, wash, and dry a good-sized fresh trout. Fill the cavity 
with veal forcemeat for fish and truss the head. Place it in a 
saucepan, cover it with broth, and boil it until it is done. Have 
ready a long piece of fried bread as long as the fish, cover the 
bread with paper, and when the trout is cold, drained, and 
thoroughly dry, place it on the top with the butter beneath it. 
Glaze with a half set aspic jelly, decorate the edge with jelly 
croutons. Garnish the base with halves of hard-boiled eggs 
and small heads of lettuce cut in half, and serve with a mayon- 
naise dressing. 

Calf s-foot Jelly 

Bone and soak four calf's feet in cold water for one hour. 
Wash well, parboil, and then boil with four quarts of water 
until soft. Skim off all the fat, pass the liquid through a wet 
cloth. Put some in a saucer and set on ice to cool so as to test 
it. If too hard, add water; if too soft, boil a little longer. 
Put three pints of the liquid in an earthen saucepan with four 
cloves, a little ginger and cinnamon, the juice of two lemons, 
twelve ounces of granulated sugar, and a gill of Madeira wine. 
Beat two eggs with a little water, mix into the preparation, 
and stir over the fire until it comes to a boil. Strain twice 
through a jelly bag. Pour into eight or more crystal jelly 
glasses. Cool thoroughly, serve one to each person. 

Chicken Jelly served with Any Salad 

Take one fowl chopped in small pieces, — use feet, head,

Boiled Artichokes 

Wash the artichokes well in several waters and soak them 
for a few hours in salted water to remove any insects which 
may be in the leaves. Trim away the leaves at the bottom. 
Cut off the stems. Place them in boiling salted water and 
boil until tender. Leave the saucepan uncovered while they 
are boiling. To two quarts of water add one tablespoonful of 
salt and a pinch of washing soda about the size of a pea. The 
last-named ingredient tends to keep them green. They are 
sufficiently cooked when the leaves can easily be removed. 
Drain them and serve with a little white sauce poured over 
them. Serve melted butter in a separate dish. This vegeta- 
ble will cook in less than half an hour. 

Artichokes a la Lyonnaise 

Pull off the leaves without damaging the bottoms of the 
artichokes, which must be turned smooth with a knife. Cut 
the artichokes into quarters, and, after removing the fibrous 
parts, parboil them in salted water for about five minutes. 
Then drain in a colander and plunge them in cold water. 
Drain them on a cloth and arrange them in a circle in a sauce- 
pan which is thickly spread with four ounces of butter. Sift a 
dessertspoonful of powdered sugar over them. Season with 
salt and coarse white pepper and moisten with one glass of 
white wine and a tablespoonful of rich consomme. Place them 
on a slow fire and let them simmer gently for three-quarters of

butter has been thoroughly mixed with the sauce, pour it over 
the artichokes and serve. 

Artichokes a l'ltalienne 

These are prepared the same as above, except brown Ital- 
ienne sauce must be substituted for Espagnole sauce. 

Artichokes with Butter Sauce 

Trim the bottom of six artichokes, cut off the tips of the 
leaves, and boil them in salted water for three-quarters of an 
hour. When done, drain them on a sieve and then soak them 
for five minutes in cold water. Remove the fibrous portion 
from the inside with the handle of a tablespoon and put them 
back in some hot water for a few minutes. When warmed 
through, drain them upside down, putting them on a cloth to 
absorb the moisture. Pour a little butter sauce inside each 
one, and serve with some of the sauce in a separate dish. 
Melted butter with a little lemon juice mixed with it may be 
used in place of the sauce. 

Butter Sauce 

Mix one heaping teaspoonful of flour and one gill of cold 
water, add a little salt, two peppercorns, a dash of grated 
nutmeg, a clove, and half an ounce of butter. Stir over the 
fire until it comes to a boil. Let it cook slowly for fifteen 
minutes. Remove from the fire and gradually add one-half 
pound of fresh butter and the pice, of one lemon. If the sauce 



234 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

should become too thick, add a little more water. Strain 
through a wet cloth. 

Baked Asparagus 

Scrape, wash, and bunch as much white asparagus as 
required. Boil until rather firm, then drain on a cloth with- 
out cooling. Have the following sauce prepared : Mix a scant 
pint of thick Bechamel sauce with three egg yolks and three 
ounces of grated Parmesan cheese. Stir over the fire until it 
comes to a boil. In an oval buttered baking dish range a 
layer of asparagus, — all the heads one way, — cover the eating 
part only with some of the sauce and a little grated cheese. 
Add another layer of asparagus, etc., until the whole is used. 
Finish with the sauce, grated cheese, and a few fresh bread 
crumbs. Put small pieces of butter on top. Do not have any 
of this mixture on the stalks. Cover the stalks with a curved 
tin sheet so that only the mashed part will be exposed to the 
heat, and bake to a nice brown. Take off the tin sheet and 
serve. 

Baked Asparagus 

Cut the stalks into inch lengths and boil them slowly in 
salted water. When tender, drain and arrange in a baking 
dish, pouring over a rich, drawn butter sauce or sauce Hollan- 
daise. Grate a good cheese — Parmesan is the best — over the 
top and brown. 

Baked Asparagus 

First cook the asparagus in water till tender, and then put 
it in a baking dish with about one tablespoonful of the grated 
Parmesan scattered between each layer. Melt one tablespoon- 
ful of butter in the frying pan, and when it is quite hot fry 
two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion till brown. Pour this 
over the asparagus, add another sprinkling of the cheese, and 
last of all some fine bread crumbs. Brown delicately in a, hot 
oven.

Fried Asparagus 

Fried asparagus is made just exactly as well from the canned 
variety of the vegetable as from the fresh. Drain the asparagus 
on a cloth, season it with white pepper and with salt. Dust it 
lightly with flour, then dip in beaten egg, and roll in sifted 
bread crumbs. Fry it in hot fat. The best plan is to use 
half butter and half lard, the whole being strictly limited in 
quantity.- Serve on a hot dish. 

Asparagus Canapes 

Scrape lightly the stalks, boil until the stalks are tender, 
when half done add a little salt. When done prepare each 
bunch to serve on separate plates. Take a slice of toast, dip 
quickly in the asparagus water. Lay this on the plate, sprinkle 
a very little salt over it, also pour a small quantity of melted 
butter. Lay the asparagus on this. Remove the string from 
the bunches. Sprinkle a little more salt over it and over this 
pour melted butter. 

Brussels Sprouts in Cream 

Take off any loose leaves hanging from the sprouts, put 
them in cold water, and let them stand half an hour so that 
if any insects are in them they will come out. Then put them 
on to boil, using one quart of sprouts to two quarts of boiling 
water. They will probably be done in twenty minutes or half 
an hour. Have them well cooked, but not softened to lose 
their shape. Toward the end of the boiling add a tablespoon- 
ful of salt. Drain off the water, add a dash of pepper, and 
a small cup of cream in which a teaspoon of flour or corn-starch 
has been stirred. Let the sprouts simmer five or ten minutes 
in the cream and serve.

Baked Bananas 

Fill a baking dish with bananas which have been peeled, cut 
in halves, lengthwise, and crosswise. To one banana allow two 
tablespoonfuls of water, one of sugar, one teaspoonful of melted 
butter, one of lemon juice, and a few grains of salt. Baste 
often and cook slowly a half an hour or till the bananas are 
red and syrup thick. Serve very hot. 

Banana Fritters 

Beat three eggs, one pint of milk, and flour enough to make 
stiff batter, add one teaspoonful of baking powder. Peel the 
bananas. Cut them in four pieces. Dip each one separately 
in the batter and drop in boiling fat. Fry three or four 
minutes, drain on paper, and serve with wine sauce. Sprinkle 
with powdered sugar before serving. 

Stuffed Cabbage 

Select two medium-sized solid cabbages. Remove the loose 
leaves, wash carefully, and soak them in salted water for one 
hour. Then parboil for fifteen minutes. Cool in fresh water, 
press the water out, and set them on a cloth to drain. Make 
a forcemeat with one-half pound of raw, lean veal and one-half 
pound of fat pork. Chop fine, pound well, and rub through 
puree sieve. Season with salt and white pepper, grated nut- 
meg, and chopped parsley, add the yolks of four eggs, and 
mix well. Slit the cabbages, cut out the cores, and fill with 
the forcemeat. Place them together and wrap them in thin 
slices of fat pork. Tie them with strings. Put them in a 
saucepan with a quart of broth and one glass of Sherry wine. 
Cover and cook slowly for two hours and till the liquid is 
reduced to a glaze. Dish up the cabbage, untie the strings, 
remove pieces of pork, and drain. Take off the fat from the 
glaze, add two ladlefuls of brown sauce to the saucepan to 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 237 

dilute it. Pour the sauce over the well-drained cabbages 
and serve hot. 

Mushrooms make a delicious stuffing for the cabbage when 
they are boiled, chopped, seasoned with salt and pepper, fried, 
and finally mixed with half their quantity of boiled rice and 
eggs, allowing two eggs to a head of cabbage. 

Colonial Dutch Sour Cabbage 

Carefully shave or chop the head of a white cabbage and 
put it in a saucepan with a little hot water. Cover closely 
and let it cook slowly on the back of the range in its steam and 
juice for four or five hours. A little before time to serve, 
add salt to taste, a small tablespoonful will commonly do, a 
large cup of thick sour cream, a dash of pepper, and let all 
boil up so that the cream will cook into the cabbage. 

At last, just before serving, add a tablespoonful of vinegar 
or more if the vinegar is weak, stir it in thoroughly, and serve. 

During the cooking the cabbage may need more water. If 
so, add boiling water and so little of it that when it is time to 
add the cream the water will be almost cooked out. If your 
cabbage head is large, you may need more than a cup of cream. 
The cream should be enough to whiten and oil all the cabbage. 
If sweet cream is used, you may need more vinegar. Sour 
cream is best when obtainable. 

Carrots a rAllemande 

Prepare two bunches of spring carrots, keeping their origi- 
nal shape, but making them all equal in size. Parboil them in 
salted water for about ten minutes. Drain them in a colander 
and plunge them in cold water. Drain them again and lay 
them on a napkin. Then place them in a deep saucepan with 
two ounces of fresh butter, two ounces of loaf sugar, and about 
one pint of good consomme. Put the lid on and let them boil 



238 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

very gently over a slow fire for half an hour. Then set them 
to boil briskly until their liquor is reduced to a glaze. Serve 
in a round-bottomed dish, building them up in a perfect dome. 
Garnish with Allemande sauce mixed with a little finely chopped 
parsley. Pour the remainder of the glaze over the carrots and 
serve very hot. 

Carrots with Cream Sauce 

Peel and cut enough new carrots in one-sixth of an inch 
slices. Put them in a saucepan with one-half pint of water, 
a little salt, tablespoonful sugar, and one ounce of butter. 
Cover and cook about one-half hour, tossing occasionally. 
Add a liaison of three egg yolks, — the liaison including twice 
as much cold water as you have liquid yolks when beaten, — 
and one-half cup cream, one ounce of butter, and chopped 
parsley. Mix carefully by tossing in the saucepan. Serve 
at once. 

Baked Cauliflower 

Pare off the green leaves and boil two heads of cauliflower 
in salted water and a small piece of butter. Drain, season 
inside and out with salt, pepper, and a little grated nutmeg. 
Put in dome form on a buttered baking dish. Mix one scant 
pint of thick Bechamel sauce with four egg yolks and four 
ounces of American or Parmesan cheese, grated. Let all boil 
a minute, cover the cauliflower with it, and smooth with the 
blade of a knife. Then sprinkle with fine bread crumbs, more 
grated cheese, and a few bits of butter. Bake to a nice color 
twenty minutes. 

Boiled Cauliflower 

Select a medium-sized cauliflower. Trim neatly and soak 
it in salt and water for two hours. Then examine it thoroughly 
and wash it in fresh water. Place it in a saucepan with a 
small handful of salt, white pepper, and enough water to cover 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 239 

it. Boil until tender for one-half hour or more. Drain in a 
colander, place on a dish, and cover with a rich white sauce 
or a Hollandaise sauce. 

Cauliflower with Parmesan Cheese 

Remove the green stalks and if large divide into quarters 
one or more fresh cauliflowers. Wash and soak in salted water 
for one hour. Then place in hot water with a lump of butter, 
a little salt, and coarse white pepper. When cooked tender, 
drain on a sieve. Arrange cauliflower, flowerets down, in a 
deep dish, in a few minutes invert on the dish it is to be served 
on and entirely cover it with the following sauce : Mix one 
cup of veloute sauce with four ounces of Parmesan cheese, 
with beaten yolks of four eggs, a good-sized lump of butter, 
a little lemon juice, salt and white pepper to taste. Stir this 
over the fire until it is well mixed. Do not let it boil. After 
making the cauliflower with this sauce, smooth the top, and 
cover it with a coating of Parmesan cheese. Place in the 
oven for fifteen minutes until it is a nice brown. Garnish 
with fried bread cut in fancy shapes. The bread may be ar- 
ranged in the shape of a cornucopia and the cauliflower placed 
in it before it is masked. Then there is no danger of the cauli- 
flower spreading. 

Fried Cauliflower 

Parboil two cauliflowers in salted water. Drain and break 
them in small bunches. Make a batter of two tablespoons 
of olive oil, six ounces of flour, salt and white pepper, three 
eggs, and one glass of milk. Beat with an egg-beater until 
very smooth. Dip each piece of cauliflower in this batter and 
then drop one by one in deep hot fat. Fry until crisp and 
light brown. Drain on brown paper and serve on a folded 
napkin.

Celery a la Villeroi 

Clean six heads of celery and cut them in pieces about six 
inches long. Parboil them in water for ten minutes and then 
immerse them in cold water. Drain them on a sieve and after- 
ward place them on a saucepan with enough white broth to 
cover them. Let them cook over a slow fire for one hour. 
When done, drain on a cloth to free them from all the mois- 
ture. Qover them with some reduced Allemande sauce and set 
away until cold. Roll them in fine bread crumbs, then dip 
in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs again. Arrange in wire 
basket and fry in hot lard until they become a light brown. 
Drain on heavy brown paper and serve very hot. 

Celery a la Creme 
Wash and cut the celery in small pieces. Put them in a 
saucepan and cook gently till tender in a broth of chicken or 
veal. Water may be used instead of the broth. Add cream 
in the proportion of a cup of cream to two cups of the chopped 
celery. Season with salt and pepper and let the whole boil up. 
If a thickening is wished, stir a little flour in the cream. 

Buffalo Corn Oysters 
Cut down each row of kernels on fresh sweet corn-cobs, 
running a sharp knife down the centre of each row, and then 
scrape out the pulp. Do not cut the kernels off the cob. 
To one cup of the pulp add the yolk of one egg, a seasoning of 
butter, pepper and salt, and, just before frying, the white beaten 
stiff. Drop from a spoon into a hot frying pan, in which a little 
butter is melted, and fry a golden brown. 

Corn Fritters 
One pint of grated sweet corn, one and a half cups of milk, 
one-half cup of flour, one tablespoonful of melted butter, two 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 241 

eggs, a little salt and pepper, and one teaspoonful of baking 
powder. Mix the milk and well-beaten eggs together, add the 
melted butter and seasoning, then the flour and baking powder 
sifted together, lastly stir in the grated corn. Drop by the 
tablespoonful in hot fat. Drain on brown paper and serve 
very hot. 

Stuffed Cucumbers 

Pare off the peel and both ends of some large cucumbers 
and cut in lengths about two inches long. Remove all the 
seeds. Parboil them in salted water and drain thoroughly. 
Then fill each piece of cucumber with chicken forcemeat. 
Arrange them in a saucepan which is lined with thin slices of 
bacon, then cover them with slices of bacon. Moisten them 
with a little beef broth and cook over a slow fire for half an 
hour. When they have become quite tender, drain them on a 
cloth and serve them with Espagnole sauce. 

Stuffed Cucumbers with Sauce 
For six or eight persons peel four cucumbers of good size. 
After cutting off the ends, cut each cucumber into two parts. 
Remove the seeds with an apple corer. Put a tablespoonful of 
salt in one quart of cold water. Put the cucumbers in the 
liquid and set away in a cool place. Chop about one-quarter 
of a pound of veal in fine pieces. See that there is no gristle or 
fat. Mix one gill of milk and one-third of a gill of fine bread 
crumbs. Cook until it becomes a smooth, paste. Ten minutes 
will probably be long enough. Then add the veal, one-half 
teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of pepper, an 
eighth of a teaspoonful of thyme, one-quarter of a teaspoonful 
of onion juice, one teaspoonful of butter, and one well-beaten 
egg. Remove the cucumbers from the water, dry thoroughly 
and fill with the forcemeat. Pack them solidly and be careful 
to have the ends of the cucumbers smooth. Lay them in a 
stewpan. Pour over them one pint and a half of boiling veal 



242 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

stock or chicken stock, adding one bay leaf. If the stock has 
no seasoning, add one-half teaspoonf ul of salt and one-fifth of a 
teaspoonful of white pepper. Cover and let them simmer for 
three-quarters of an hour. When served, place the cucumber 
on thin slices of toast. Cover with the following sauce and 
serve at once : — 

Sauce 

Rub together until smooth three tablespoonfuls of butter, 
one generous tablespoonful of flour, then add three gills of 
white stock, a bit of carrot the size of a quarter of a dollar, one 
slice of onion the same size, a sprig of parsley, a clove, a bay 
leaf and a little grating of nutmeg, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a fifth of a teaspoonful of white pepper. Simmer for half an 
hour. Add one teaspoonful of lemon juice. Strain and serve. 

Fried Egg Plant 

Prepare a medium-sized egg plant two or three hours before 
cooking. Peel and cut it in even slices about one-quarter of an 
inch thick. Place them on a dish, sprinkle each slice with a 
little salt and pepper. Put them in press with a heavy weight 
on top. This will extract all the bitter taste. Dip each slice 
in beaten egg, then in fine bread crumbs. Fry in hot fat until 
a nice brown. Season with a little salt, drain on brown paper, 
and serve very hot. If one prefer, the egg plant may be dipped 
in thin batter instead of egg and crumbs, and cooked in the 
same way. 

Stuffed Egg Plant 

Take two medium-sized egg plants. Cut off the stem, slit 
lengthwise in halves, tracing the incisions inside. Fry the 
plants until soft, then drain. Then take two ounces of butter, 
two ounces of finely chopped pork, two ounces of finely chopped 
shallots, one pint of chopped mushrooms. Stir and cook ten 
minutes. With a tablespoon take up most of the fleshy part of 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 243 

the egg plant, put with the above preparation, and season 
with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. Mix thoroughly and 
put this stuffing in the egg plants on a baking dish. Sprinkle 
with fresh bread crumbs and grated cheese — Parmesan or 
American. Drop a little sweet oil over and bake light brown 
in a pretty hot oven. Slide on a dish, pour a ladleful of brown 
sauce round it, and serve. 

Boiled Hominy 
Wash one cup of white hominj', and after draining, place in 
a double boiler. Add one teaspoonful of salt and one quart of 
boiling water. Boil moderately for one hour or until tender. 

Braised Lettuce 

Trim, wash, and scald twelve white heart cabbage lettuces. 
Drain them on a cloth, cut and spread them open, season with 
pepper and salt, tie each one up with a string, and place in 
a pan on thin layers of fat bacon. Add a carrot, a small bou- 
quet, and an onion with two cloves stuck in it. Cover with a 
buttered piece of paper and moisten with the toppings from 
white stock. Boil slowly by the side of the fire for fifty minutes. 
Drain them on a sieve. Then remove the strings. Press them 
neatly in a cloth and open each lettuce head with a knife. 
Turn the ends of the leaves so as to give to the lettuce a 
smooth, rounded end. Cut off the stalk and place each lettuce 
head carefully in a saucepan. Strain the liquor they were 
boiled in. Remove every particle of grease and boil down to 
the consistency of a half glaze. Add it to the lettuce and 
fifteen minutes before they are required set them in the oven to 

get warm. 

Fried Lima Beans 

Put three pints of shelled Lima beans in salted boiling 
water and cook until they are tender. Drain thoroughly and 
put in a saucepan with four ounces of melted butter, salt and 



244 MBS. seelt's cook book 

pepper to taste. Shake the pan over a brisk fire for a few- 
minutes, add finely chopped parsley and a little lemon juice. 
Shake thoroughly, to mix all together, and serve. 

Macaroni a la Reine 

Take eight ounces of macaroni, break it in pieces three or 
four inches long, wash it in cold water, and at once drop it 
lightly and by degrees into a pan of boiling water. Let it boil 
until the pipes are tender, which may be in about fifteen or 
twenty minutes. When it is half done, add a tablespoon of 
salt, and shake the pan now and then to keep the macaroni 
free from the bottom. When cooked, turn it upon a sieve or 
colander to drain. Have ready ten ounces of rich, well-flavored 
white cheese, dissolved in a pint of cream. Add to the cream 
and cheese a little salt, a rather full seasoning of cayenne, and a 
couple of ounces of sweet butter. Lay the macaroni in a dish, 
pour over it the cheese sauce, strew it thickly with cubes of 
fine white bread fried a pale gold color and dried perfectly, and 
serve. As a matter of precaution, it is well to boil the cream 
before the cheese is melted in it. 

The cheese should be sliced very thin and be quite free 
from the hard part next the rind. It should be stirred in the 
cream without ceasing until thoroughly dissolved and the 
whole is perfectly smooth. 

Macaroni Croquettes 
Cook a quarter of a pound of macaroni in salted water, 
drain and put in a saucepan with two ounces of butter, one 
ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, salt and white pepper to 
taste, and a ladleful of Allemande sauce. Mix thoroughly and 
turn into a small buttered square tin pan. Cover it with a 
buttered paper, then with another pan and a light weight. 
When cold, turn it on the table, divide with a knife or oval 
pastry cutter, roll each piece in grated cheese, dip in beaten

y, roll in fine bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat. Drain on 
heavy brown paper and serve with grated Parmesan cheese in 
a separate dish. 

Macaroni a l'ltalienne 

Break the macaroni in pieces about four inches long. Boil 
it in hot water with a small lump of butter, a little salt and 
white pepper. When done, drain it on a napkin. As soon as 
it is dry, prepare the following sauce : Place one pint of tomato 
sauce in a saucepan and add two lumps of butter. Mix the 
whole well together. Sprinkle a layer of macaroni in the 
bottom of a dish, cover with the sauce, and sprinkle with Par- 
mesan cheese. Then spread the macaroni again, and so on until 
the dish is full. Strew grated Parmesan cheese over the top, 
place in hot oven for five minutes, and serve while quite hot. 

Macaroni a la Solferino 

To half a pound of macaroni, boiled in water and well 
strained, add half an onion, a slice of raw ham chopped fine and 
browned. Moisten the mixture with tomato sauce, and just 
before serving sprinkle the whole with four or five tablespoons 
of grated cheese. 

Oyster Macaroni 

Boil the macaroni in a cloth to keep it whole and when 
thoroughly cooked, drain. Put a layer in a deep dish with salt, 
white pepper, and butter, then a layer of medium-sized oysters 
seasoned in the same way, then another layer of macaroni, and 
so on until the dish is full. Mix fine bread crumbs with one 
egg well beaten, spread over the top, and bake in moderate oven. 

Boiled Macaroni or Spaghetti 

Into a saucepan nearly full of boiling water drop the 
macaroni gradually. When half done, add a little salt. Keep 



246 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

the macaroni from sinking to the bottom by moving it with a 
meat fork. When it is very tender, pour into a colander and 
drain. Put half of the macaroni into a vegetable dish. 
Sprinkle it with salt, pepper, and a little dry Coleman's mus- 
tard, and over this pour melted butter. Add grated cheese. 
Then lay on the other half of the macaroni and add the same 
seasoning. Pour on melted butter, and with a fork turn the 
macaroni over in the butter. Serve without baking. 

Stewed Mushrooms 

Take one pound of large and dry mushrooms. Peel and 
wash them, drain thoroughly, and cut them in small squares. 
Put them in an earthen bowl and pour over them one table- 
spoonful of olive oil, a scant tablespoonful of salt, and a tea- 
spoonful of white pepper. Let them soak for three hours. 
Remove them, and let them stew in their own liquor for five 
or six minutes. When tender, place them on dish and pour the 
following sauce over them : Take three tablespoonfuls of olive 
oil, one teaspoonf ul of finely chopped parsley, one-half teaspoon- 
ful of finely chopped chives, and one clove of crushed garlic. 
Mix all, and stir over the fire until thoroughly heated. 

Stuffed Mushrooms 

Select twelve mushrooms as large as possible. Cut off the 
heads, pare the edges, and wash them. Clean the stalks, wash 
with the parings, and chop very fine. Squeeze out the water. 
Put two ounces of butter in a saucepan with one tablespoonful 
of chopped shallot. Fry a little, then stir in the chopped mush- 
rooms, and fry until almost dry. Sprinkle with one-half ounce 
of flour. Then mix well and moisten with a little broth, and 
season to taste with salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg, also a 
little chopped parsley. Stir and boil until quite thick. When 
this mixture is partially cool, fill the mushroom heads. Place 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 247 

them in a baking-dish, sprinkle each 'with bread crumbs and a 
small piece of butter. Bake in moderate oven about fifteen 
minutes. Place on a dish, pour Espagnole sauce round them, 
and garnish with quarters of lemon. 

Pried Mushrooms with Tomato Sauce 

Take two pounds of fresh mushrooms, peel, and wash them 
in water and a little vinegar to keep them as white as possible. 
Drain, then slice the heads in two or three pieces, and chop up 
the stalks. Have one-quarter of a pint of heated olive oil, add 
the heads and fry until a light brown, then add two table- 
spoons of chopped shallots, two bruised cloves of garlic, and the 
chopped stalks. Drain most of the oil off, add two ladlefuls of 
tomato sauce and a little melted beef extract. Season with 
salt, white pepper, and a dash of cayenne. Boil two minutes, 
shaking the saucepan all the time. Add a little lemon juice 
and chopped parsley and pour in" a deep dish. 

Mushrooms a la Bindley 

Have at hand two pounds of fresh and firm mushrooms. 
Cut and trim the stalks, pare the heads, and wash them. Put 
in a saucepan with a little water, four ounces of but£er and the 
juice of two lemons. Cook for five minutes over a brisk fire, 
occasionally shaking the pan. Take the upper crust of four 
French rolls, remove the inside, and fry the crust in clarified 
butter. Mix the gravy the mushrooms were cooked in with 
three pints of veloute sauce. Add four ounces of butter, the 
yolks of four eggs, and white pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly 
and rub through a wet cloth. Pour a little of this sauce in a 
dish, arrange the crusts, hollow side uppermost, on the dish, put 
the mushrooms in the sauce, heat thoroughly, then fill each 
crust, taking care to have the largest and whitest mushrooms 
on top.

Oatmeal 
Place one cup of oatmeal in a double boiler, add one tea- 
spoonful of salt, and one quart and a pint of boiling water. 
Stir occasionally while it boils over a moderate fire for half an 
hour, or until the flakes are tender. If too thick, it may be 
thinned with boiling water. 

Stewed Okra with Tomato Sauce 
Pare both ends and wash the okra. Put in a saucepan with 
salt and pepper, a ladlef ul of rich broth, and half a pint of tomato 
sauce, and one-half pint of Espagnole sauce. Cover and stew 
slowly for one-half hour. Dish carefully without breaking the 
okra. Sprinkle with parsley and serve. 

Glazed Onions 
Peel twelve medium-sized white onions and soak them for 
one hour in cold water, changing the water twice while they 
are soaking. Drain them on a sieve. Put two ounces of but- 
ter in a saucepan. Add one teaspoonful of sugar and half a 
cup of beef broth or stock. Arrange the onions in the pan so 
they do not touch. Cook over a slow fire until they become 
tender and the outside is brown. Remove the cover from the 
saucepan, put a very little beef extract on top of each onion. 
Then place the pan in the oven for five minutes. When the 
extract melts and a nice glaze forms on the top of the onions, 
they are ready to serve as a garnish or vegetable. If served as 
a vegetable, the sauce they were cooked in may be poured over 

them.

medium size, in an hour, or perhaps an hour and a half. By 
the time they are tender the water should be pretty well cooked 
out. Pour over them as they lie in the saucepan enough cream 
to reach to their middle. Boil up, salt if necessary, dish by tak- 
ing the onions out one by one with a cooking ladle, having care 
not to break them, and pour over the hot cream and serve. 

Stuffed Onions 
Boil six large onions slowly for one hour in plenty of clear 
water. Remove from the water, and with a sharp knife cut a 
piece from the centre of each. Mix together two tablespoonfuls 
of finely chopped ham, three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 
one tablespoonful of butter, three tablespoonfuls of milk or 
cream, one egg, one-half teaspoonful salt, and a grain of cay- 
enne. Fill with this mixture the spaces cut in the onion. 
Sprinkle each one with bread crumbs, one-half a teaspoonful of 
butter on each onion. Place on earthen plates, and bake in 
slow oven for one hour. Serve with cream sauce. Spanish 
onions are the best to use. 

Boiled Onions 
Peel off the whole thick outer skin and lay the onions one- 
half an hour in cold water. Pour hot water over them and 
boil ten minutes. Pour off this water, add fresh water and a 
teaspoon of salt, and boil until tender at the core, which will 
take one hour or one hour and a half. Turn into a colander, 
drain, with a spoon lay each onion in the vegetable dish. Sift 
salt over each one, and pour over all a small quantity of melted 
butter or hot cream, and finish with a dash of pepper. 

Fried Parsley- 
Soak parsley in ice water for two hours, so it will be crisp. 
Dry thoroughly, arrange in frying basket, plunge in boiling 
hot fat, leave for a second, remove basket from fat, shake it. 
Plunge in fat once more, drain on brown paper, and serve,

Parsnip Cakes 

Peel, cut in pieces, and cook some parsnips in salted water 
in which a tablespoonful of flour has been mixed. When ten- 
der, drain thoroughly, chop fine, and press through a fine col- 
ander. Return to the saucepan, add salt, a little white pepper, 
a little flour, and the beaten yolks of three eggs. Stir on the 
fire for five minutes and put on a plate to cool. Then turn on 
a floured table and divide in the shape and size of a small cod- 
fish ball. Dip in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs. Fry 
until light brown in very hot lard. Drain on brown paper, 
garnish with parsley, and serve hot. These are very good with 
pork chop. 

Parsnip Balls 

Parboil six large parsnips, let them get cold, then peel and 
grate them. Beat two eggs until very light and mix thor- 
oughly with the grated parsnips, adding sufficient flour to bind 
the mixture together. Flour the hands, roll the mixture into 
balls, and drop in deep boiling fat. Fry until a good brown, 
drain on brown paper. Serve very hot. 

Stewed Peas 

Put one quart of young peas in a pan with plenty of water 
and four ounces of butter. Rub the peas and butter together 
until they are well mixed. Then drain off the water and put 
the peas into a stewpan with two cabbage leaves shredded 
small, a small bunch of parsley and green onions, one dessert- 
spoonful of powdered sugar, and a little salt. Put the lid on 
and stew the peas gently over a slow fire for about half an hour. 
When done, if there seems to be much liquid, boil it down 
quickly over the fire. Knead two ounces of fresh butter with 
one dessert-spoonful of flour. Put this into the peas and toss 
the whole together over the fire until well mixed. 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 251 

Canned Peas 

Pour the peas in a colander. Rinse by pouring through 
plenty of water. Add three large iron spoons of cold water, 
salt, a little sugar, enough so they will taste like a sweet pea, 
and a lump of butter. Set the saucepan in another of hot 
water, cover, and cook half an hour. 

Peppers with Tomato Stuffing 

Immerse as many medium-sized peppers as desired in boiling 
fat for one-half a minute, rub them with a towel to remove the 
peel. Cut round the stem or core, remove it and the seeds. 
Fill with a tomato stuffing, put in a pan, baste frequently with 
olive oil, and bake in moderate oven for half an hour. Place 
on a platter, pour a tomato sauce round them, and serve. 

Tomato Stuffing 

Take two ounces of butter, two tablespoonfuls of olive oil, 
two of finely chopped onions, and a pint of chopped mushrooms. 
Stir and fry about twelve minutes, seasoning with salt, white 
pepper, and a dash of cayenne, a little nutmeg, one ladleful of 
Espagnole sauce, and one of tomato sauce. Then add three 
handfuls of fresh bread crumbs, yolks of four eggs, and one 
tablespoonful chopped parsley. Mix thoroughly. Cook three 
minutes longer. Set away to cool. 

Potatoes 

Potatoes for baking or boiling whole should be of the same 
size, thoroughly washed and scrubbed with a brush kept for the 
purpose. They should bake in a hot oven from thirty to forty- 
five minutes, according to their size, and to boil have enough 
boiling salted water to cover them, and boil about thirty min- 
utes. Pare before boiling, except for salad. 



252 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Plain boiled potatoes are served whole or rubbed through a 
fine colander and served like rice, or mashed and seasoned with 
salt, white pepper, butter, and milk, and served in mass or in 
fancy shapes and browned. Parisienne potatoes are cut in balls 
with a French ball-cutter, boiled ten or twelve minutes, and 
dressed with melted butter, salt, white pepper, and minced pars- 
ley, or sifted hard-boiled egg yolk. Baked potatoes are often 
cut lengthwise, removed from the skin, mashed, seasoned, and 
made light with whipped egg white or cream. The skins are 
then refilled, placed in the oven until brown, and served as 
souffle potatoes. Raw potatoes are sliced thin or cut in straws, 
dice, balls, crescents, curls, etc., and fried in deep hot fat. All 
peeled potatoes should stand in cold water until they are boiled 
or fried. If fried, dry thoroughly before dropping in hot fat. 
Cold boiled potatoes are cut in dice or thin slices, seasoned with 
salt and pepper, and fried brown in very hot drippings or butter, 
with a little chopped onion and parsley. 

German Potato Cakes 

This well-known German dish has been made a part of the 
cookery of our country, introduced by many of our German 
families. In making it grate the potatoes raw, add butter to 
enrich it, eggs and flour to hold the grated potato together, a 
little salt, and season with sugar and cinnamon to taste. The 
cakes are fried in butter on a griddle or in a flat saucepan till 
brown. 

Stewed Potatoes 

Chop cold boiled potatoes rather fine and salt carefully. 
Add milk — just even with the potatoes — and a large table- 
spoon of butter. Place this in a saucepan and cover. Set it in 
another pan of boiling water, Stir occasionally and cook one 
hour until creamy.

Potato Ribbons 

Peel the potatoes, then peel round and round very thinly. 
Let the ribbons lie in cold water for an hour. Drain and 
plunge in hot fat, using a frying basket. Drain off the fat on 
paper and serve hot. 

Potato Croquettes 

Add to the boiled and mashed potatoes half their weight of 
butter, and seasoning of salt and pepper, a trifle of onion, minced 
fine, and two well-beaten eggs. Form them in egg, ball, or 
cork shape, dip them in the beaten yolk of eggs and then into 
bread crumbs. Cover them, and let them stand for an hour or 
so. Dip them again in the egg and bread crumbs and fry in 
deep hot fat. Garnish with parsley and serve hot. Let them 
drain a moment before serving. 

Pockets of Gold 

Prepare the potatoes as for croquettes in the receipt given 
above. Scoop out the centre of each croquette and fill in with 
this salpicon: Mince cooked chicken, not too fine, but rather 
in dice size. Heat it with butter and add cooked mushroom 
dice and cooked pickled tongue dice, with salt and pepper for a 
flavoring. Thicken this salpicon with the yolk of egg in which 
has been stirred a dash of sugar, a few drops of lemon juice, 
and of some aromatic wine. After you have packed the salpi- 
con in the potato ball, press a little of the potato over the open- 
ing. Dip the ball in the beaten yolk of egg, then into bread 
crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat. Drain them on paper and 
serve them hot. 

Sweet Potato Croquettes 

Mix one pint of mashed sweet potatoes with one-half cupful 
of hot milk. Then stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter and one. 



254 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

teaspoonful of salt. Beat one egg very light and add to the 
mixture. Next shape them in the desired sized croquettes. 
Dip in beaten egg, then roll in bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat 
until a delicate brown. Drain on brown paper and serve hot. 

Wined Sweet Potatoes 

Boil the potatoes and set them to cool. When cold, peel 
and slice them. In a well-buttered baking dish spread a layer 
of the potatoes, sprinkle with butter, sugar, and a little salt, 
then another layer of potatoes, butter, and other ingredients, 
and so continue the layers until the dish is full, having laid on 
top a plentiful supply of butter. Put a little water in the dish 
to prevent dryness, invert over the baking dish another dish 
that will hold in the steam pretty well, and set to bake in a 
moderate oven. After the potatoes are thoroughly heated, 
take off the covering dish, let them brown a trifle, and just 
before taking from the oven pour over them a little wine of a 
flavor agreeing with the potatoes. 

Rice Croquettes with Sauce 

Wash one pound of rice and put it in a saucepan with three 
pints of milk, six ounces of granulated sugar, two ounces of 
butter, and the rind of a lemon. Stir until it comes to a boil, 
then cover, and cook one-half hour. Remove the lemon, add 
the yolks of four eggs, mix well, and partially cool. Sprinkle 
fine bread crumbs on a board, turn the rice on them, divide and 
roll in a dozen large, cork-shaped croquettes. Dip in beaten 
egg, roll in fresh bread crumbs, and fry bight brown in deep hot 
fat. Drain on brown paper, roll in powdered sugar, and serve 
hot on a folded napkin with sauce in separate dish. 

Sauce for Rice Croquettes 

Yolks of four eggs, four ounces of sugar, one ounce of corn- 
starch, and the finely chopped rind of one lemon. Mix thor- 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 255 

oughly, add one pint of boiling milk. Stir with an egg-beater 
over the fire until the sauce thickens. 

Bice Fritters 

Boil a cup of rice in a pint of milk until the rice is soft and 
the milk is absorbed. Take from the fire and add the yolks of 
three eggs, one tablespoon of sugar, a small spoon of salt, and 
two tablespoons of butter. When the mixture grows cold, add 
the whites of the eggs beaten stiff. Drop in large spoonfuls in 
hot fat and let them cook until they are a golden brown. 

Spanish Rice 

One cup of rice in two quarts of boiling salted water. Boil 
fifteen minutes. Pour into a fine sieve. Place the sieve over 
boiling water and steam the rice for thirty minutes. Chop 
one-half can of Spanish peppers very fine. Mix with the rice 
and serve. The dish may be used as a garnish for boiled ham 
or mutton. 

Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce 

Place the ends of a handful of spaghetti in a kettle of boiling 
salted water. As it softens, bend and coil it round in the ket- 
tle. Put a cover on and cook fifteen or twenty minutes, or 
until tender. Drain in a colander. Then return to the kettle 
with enough tomato sauce to make it quite moist, a third of 
a cup of grated cheese, — American or Parmesan, — one table- 
spoonful of butter, and a dash of paprika. Cook slowly until 
the sauce is about absorbed. 

Spinach on Toast 

Boil the spinach in salted water until half done. Pour off 
the hot water, dash cold water over the vegetable, and having 
wiped it dry, chop it fine and put it in a saucepan. Make a 
sauce of one tablespoon of flour, the same quantity of butter, 



256 MBS. seely's cook book 

and a cup of cream or bouillon. Mix this sauce well with the 
spinach. Cover the saucepan and cook until it thickens. 
Serve on small slices of buttered toast. 

Spinach mixed with sorrel or young nettles is prepared 
in this way, except when sorrel is used some sugar is also 
added. 

Spinach Timbale 

Boil one peck of spinach in just enough water to cover it 
and add two tablespoonfuls of salt. When tender, drain thor- 
oughly, chop very fine, and set away to cool. Then put it in a 
saucepan with one-half pint of Bechamel sauce, one-quarter of a 
pint of stock, and two ounces of butter. Let this simmer slowly 
for five minutes. When cool, mix this with six ounces of veal 
forcemeat, the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, a little black 
pepper, and more salt if necessary. Place in a well-buttered 
mould and set in a pan of water. Cover with a buttered paper 
and bake in oven for forty-five minutes. Boil two potatoes, 
one turnip, and one carrot. When tender, cut them in fancy 
shapes and cover with a glaze. Invert timbale on platter and 
garnish with the glazed vegetables. 

Succotash 

Cut tender, juicy corn from its cobs till you have a quart 
of the cut corn. Cover the corn and set it away. Break in 
small pieces the cobs of the corn and put them to boil with a 
pint of beans. After the flavor is extracted from the cobs, 
take them out and let the beans cook till done. Then add the 
quart of corn you set aside and at the same time add salt, 
pepper, and cream to your taste. The water in which the cobs 
and beans boil should not be plentiful when the corn is added ; 
it should be allowed to boil away so there is little liquid in the 
dish except the cream. Butter and milk may be used instead 
of cream. 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 257 

Broiled Tomatoes 

Pour boiling water over as many good-sized ripe tomatoes 
as you desire. Remove the skins, cut them in two — across, 
not lengthwise. Season with salt and baste with a little oil. 
Put them on a double broiler and broil over a slow fire. Baste 
them often with olive oil. When done, serve on a hot dish. 

Pried Tomatoes 

Pour boiling water over some large, ripe tomatoes. Remove 
the skins and place where they will become cold and firm. Do 
not let them stand too long. Have at hand a kettle of boiling 
fat. Slice the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, dip in 
beaten egg, then in bread crumbs, again in egg and bread 
crumbs, arrange in a frying basket, and plunge it in the hot 
fat. In a minute or two they should be a light brown and suf- 
ficiently cooked. Drain on brown paper and serve very hot. 

Stuffed Tomatoes 

Wipe clean and remove a thin slice from the stem end of 
six smooth, ripe tomatoes. Take out the seeds and pulp, being 
careful not to break the skin. Turn upside down to drain. 
Rub the pulp through a fine sieve, and mix with an equal 
amount of fine buttered cracker crumbs, one-half the amount 
of very fine chopped meat, or chopped oysters, or cooked spa- 
ghetti. Season highly with salt, pepper, onion juice, or fried 
onions chopped fine. Heap the tomato shells with this mix- 
ture, cover with buttered crumbs, and bake twenty minutes. 

Spanish Tomatoes 

One can of tomatoes, one can of Spanish peppers, two me- 
dium-sized onions, two tablespoons of butter. Chop the onions 
fine and fry in the butter until a light brown. Then to the 



258 MBS. seely's cook book 

Spanish peppers chopped fine, add the tomatoes. Mix all 
thoroughly and cook over a medium fire five minutes, adding 
salt and white pepper to taste. Pour in baking dish and bake 
in medium oven three-quarters of an hour. Green peppers may 
be used in place of Spanish peppers. 

Devilled Tomatoes 

Powder the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs and mix with 
one teaspoonful of mustard paste, one teaspoonful of powdered 
sugar, a dash of cayenne, and a little salt. Melt three ounces 
of butter and rub it in. Then gradually stir in three table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar. Stir all over the fire until it is scalding 
hot. Remove to one side, add two well-beaten eggs, and stir 
over the fire until the mixture begins to thicken. Stand the 
saucepan in hot water to keep warm while you slice one quart 
of ripe tomatoes about half an inch thick and broil them. 
Place in hot dish and pour the sauce over them and serve at 
once. 

Tomato Faroie 

Select six nice, small, fresh tomatoes, and scald by pouring 
boiling water over them. Remove the skin, scoop out the 
inside, and set in an ice-box. Cook some sweetbreads and 
put them through the meat machine. Also chop fine some 
mushrooms and mix them with the sweetbreads. Chop 
fine two truffles and set them aside. Make a sauce of the 
following : One tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful 
of flour put in a saucepan and let come to a boil. Then 
add one cupful of white stock and the inside of the tomatoes. 
Let all boil well ten minutes. Add chopped truffles, some 
chopped parsley, and season to taste. Mix the forcemeat with 
the sauce and stuffed tomatoes. Bake until tender, and serve 
on rings of toast which are cut with biscuit cutter and fried 
in hot fat. 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 259 

Baked Tomatoes 

Take out the core of the tomato and season highly with 
salt, peppei', and one-half teaspoon of sugar. On each place a 
good-sized piece of butter. Sprinkle over with bread crumbs 
and bake an hour. Protect them with a pan of water in the 
upper oven. 

Tomato Toast with Mushrooms 

Empty in a porcelain saucepan a can of fine tomatoes, or if 
they are in season stew the tomatoes fresh for the dish. Cook 
and flavor with pepper, salt, and butter. Toast thin slices of 
stale white bread, butter, cover each slice with the stewed and 
seasoned tomatoes, and upon it lay a peeled mushroom. Butter 
the mushrooms and over each sprinkle pepper if your taste 
demands it. 

Tomatoes and Mushrooms 

Take a can of tomatoes, a dash of cayenne pepper, a heap- 
ing teaspoon of corn-starch wet with milk, and allow all to sim- 
mer till the corn-starch is cooked. Then add a teaspoon of 
grated or finely chopped onions, a can of mushrooms, and a 
good tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Cook together thor- 
oughly fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Mashed Turnip 

Pare entirely from the turnips the stringy rind, split them 
once, or even twice if they are large, and boil them till they 
are very tender. They take some time longer than potatoes to 
cook. When boiled, pour off the water, pressing them tenderly 
with a large plate to free them as much as possible from water. 
Mash them as you mash potato, but to insure their being free 
from lumps you may pass them through a colander or sieve. 
When they are young, they may be mashed smooth without 



260 MBS. SEELY'8 COOK BOOK 

this. Put them in a saucepan and stir them constantly for 
some minutes over a gentle fire to dry them, then add salt, a 
bit of fresh butter, and, if you wish, a little cream or milk. 
They should be simmered until the liquid is dried out. Mould 
low in a vegetable dish, dash pepper and lay bits of butter over 
the top, and serve. 

Turnip Dice 

For this method of cooking, the turnips should be young, 
mild, and fine-grained. After you have washed, dried, and 
peeled the turnips, slice them half an inch thick and cut the 
slices into dice. Dissolve an ounce of butter for each half 
pound of the turnips, drop them in the butter, and stew them 
very gently from three-quarters of an hour to a full hour. 
Season with salt and white pepper when they are half done. 
Serve as a vegetable or piled on broiled mutton chops. 

Vegetables a la Jardiniere 

Have at hand one can of French peas or one quart of fresh 
ones, a pint of carrot cubes, and one pint of turnip cubes, three 
gills of any kind of stock, three heaping teaspoonfuls of butter, 
three teaspoonfuls of sugar, and three teaspoonfuls of salt. 
Cook the vegetables until tender in separate saucepans. If 
French peas are used, put them in a strainer and pour over 
them one quart of cold water, drain, and place in a saucepan. 
Drain the water from the carrots and turnips. In each sauce- 
pan place one-third of the sugar, butter, salt, and stock, and set 
them where they will boil rapidly. Occasionally shake the 
pans, continue the cooking until all the stock has been absorbed. 
Spread the turnips on a platter, making the border rather thick. 
Heap the carrots on the turnips, then flatten the top of the 
mould, and heap the peas upon it. If desired, potato balls or 
cubes may be used in place of the turnip ; if so, one quart of 
the balls or cubes will be required. 



CHAPTER X 

SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES, AND FORCEMEATS 
How to make Good Sandwiches 

In the first place have bread which is close-grained and one 
day old. Each slice should be cut evenly and about one-eighth 
of an inch thick. Spread each slice with butter before you cut 
it from the loaf. After cutting, spread the slice with any mix- 
ture you may desire and cover it with another slice. Cut off 
every bit of crust and press the sandwiches together firmly. 
Cut your sandwiches in half, each half in quarters, and each 
quarter diagonally. Trim off all protruding edges of filling. 
Cover the sandwiches with a cloth wet with a very weak solu- 
tion of brandy and water and pack them in a tin box until ready 
for use. Fresh butter is preferable for sandwiches, as it is 
more dainty and delicate. If not obtainable, use best creamery 
butter. Many people when eating a sandwich spread with fish 
prefer Graham bread in place of white bread. 

Fillings for Dainty Sandwiches 

In making butters of various kinds for sandwiches, first rub 
the butter to a cream, then blend it with the flavor wanted — 
caviar, anchovy, sardine, lobster, cheese, parsley, chives, cress, 
chutney, chili, and horseradish are all used. A few drops of 
lemon juice improves any kind of fish sandwich. With an 
anchovy sandwich also add a few olives stoned and minced very 
fine. 

Wash a dozen anchovies and remove the bones. Reduce to 
a fineness by pounding the anchovies and the yolks of three 

261 



262 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

hard-boiled eggs. Mix in a little curry powder, two tablespoon- 
fuls of Parmesan cheese, a sprinkling of cayenne, and enough 
good thick cream to make a smooth paste. Spread on slices of 
bread lightly buttered, and the result will be some very accept- 
able sandwiches. 

Another idea in the way of sandwiches is to make the filling 
of horseradish grated and mixed with mayonnaise and thick 
cream. Spread this on the bread in the place of butter, lay a 
thin slice of cold roast beef over, then a slice of seasoned tomato, 
and finally add the other piece of bread, also spread with the 
horseradish. 

Still another variation may be obtained by finely mincing 
some olives, mixing them with mayonnaise and with cream, 
and spreading them over nicely sliced bread. Lay in between 
a slice of beef or mutton and a thin piece of seasoned 
tomato. When the bread is spread with some savory butter 
and covered with sliced cold roast beef and with either a small 
leaf of lettuce or with a bit of sliced cucumber, the sandwich 
is appetizing. 

Savory butters are most easily prepared. Many of them 
demand the fresh butter. Caviar butter, for instance, needs 
two tablespoonfuls of fresh butter which should be creamed, 
then mixed with one teaspoonful of lemon juice, a dash of pa- 
prika, and three tablespoonfuls of caviar paste. Curry butter 
is made by creaming one tablespoonful of curry powder. Sar- 
dine butter makes a good sandwich filling all by itself. To 
make it, remove the skin and bone from three large sardines. 
Pound them to a smoothness and add a little lemon juice, cay- 
enne, and one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Cream two 
tablespoonfuls of fresh butter and add, mixing all together very 
thoroughly. Sometimes some chopped olives are added to this 
butter, which is then used on the bread, the sandwich filling 
proper being composed of sardines boned and skinned and fla- 
vored with lemon juice. 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 263 

Peanuts mixed with mayonnaise dressing are much liked 
for afternoon sandwiches. Take the freshly roasted nuts and 
chop or roll them very fine before mixing with the dressing. 

Another excellent sandwich spreading for white or brown 
bread is made by mixing chopped olives and small crisp cucum- 
ber pickles — equal parts of these — with a seasoning of capers. 
Stir them together with a thick mayonnaise and spread on the 
bread. A vegetable coloring made from spinach will give a 
green color to the sauce, if that is sought. 

Dates and figs chopped very fine and moistened with hot 
water and lemon juice may be spread on thin slices of bread 
and sprinkled with finely chopped nuts. Finely minced ginger 
and candied orange peel may be sprinkled on Neufchatel cheese 
which has been moistened with a little butter or rich cream and 
spread on buttered slices of bread. 

Another filling for sandwiches is Oriental preserved ginger 
chopped fine and softened by mixing with a little cold cream. 
Candied orange peel and candied cherries may also be used in 
this way. 

Caviar Sandwiches 

Take a one-quarter pound box of Russian caviar and the 
juice of half a lemon and as much olive oil as you have lemon. 
Alternately drop the oil and lemon juice into the caviar until 
all is used. Then whip it until you have a firm white paste. 
Follow general directions for making a sandwich, but do not 
butter the bread. Spread the caviar quite thickly on the 
bread. 

Cheese Sandwich 

Pound one-quarter of a pound of American cheese in a 
mortar with two ounces of butter and one teaspoonful of 
dry mustard. "When thoroughly blended, add a little tar- 
ragon vinegar. Spread on thin slices of bread and it is ready 
to serve. 



264 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

Roquefort Cheese Sandwich 

To three parts of the green of Roquefort cheese use one part 
of butter, a little olive oil, pepper, a little salt, and a dash of red 
pepper. Mix all into a paste and spread on thin slices of but- 
tered bread. 

Chopped Chicken Sandwich 

Take the white meat of chicken, chop it very fine, and mix 
it with mayonnaise dressing and a few olives chopped very fine. 
Spread the mixture between evenly sliced pieces of buttered 
bread. Use enough mayonnaise to make a chicken paste. 

Chicken and Almond Sandwich 
Chop the white meat of a chicken very fine and add half a 
pound of finely chopped almonds, two teaspoons of salt, one gill 
of sweet, thick cream, and a saltspoon of pepper. Mix these 
ingredients until you have a smooth paste. Whole wheat 
bread is best for these sandwiches. 

Indian Sandwiches 

Cut the white meat of a cooked chicken in small pieces. 
Take almost as much cooked ham and four freshened anchovies 
and cut in small pieces. Mix two cups of veloute sauce with 
one dessertspoonful of curry powder which has been blended 
with a little water. Stir over the fire until it becomes a thick 
sauce. Then add the chicken, etc., and the juice of half a 
lemon. Cut some thin slices of bread with a circular tin cutter 
about one and a half inches in diameter. Fry them in clarified 
butter until a light brown. Place one-half of the pieces on a 
tin sheet, spread with a thick layer of the chicken mixture. 
Then cover with the pieces of bread. Cream some grated Par- 
mesan cheese and butter to a paste, roll into round balls. 
Place one on the top of each sandwich. About five minutes 
before serving place them in the oven and warm thoroughly. 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 265 

Lettuce and Mayonnaise Sandwiches 
Season the yolks of seven hard-boiled eggs with salt and 
pepper, powder them, and then mix with enough mayonnaise to 
make a thin paste. Have slices of bread sparingly spread with 
the mayonnaise, cover each one with some of the small leaves 
from the heart of the lettuce. Over the lettuce spread the egg 
mixture. Follow directions about cutting them. Serve as 
soon as possible. 

Salmon Sandwiches 
Take a nice solid piece of boiled salmon, mince it very fine, 
and season to taste with pepper, salt, and a little Worcester- 
shire sauce. Mix all into a paste with melted butter. Make 
a highly seasoned French dressing of vinegar, oil, pepper and 
salt, and pour over cucumbers which have been peeled and 
sliced very thin. Then set them on the ice for fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Evenly spread two thin slices of unbuttered 
bread with the salmon mixture. Put a slice of cucumber 
between them and shape sandwich according to the general 
rule. You may prepare your bread spread with salmon one- 
half or three-quarters of an hour before serving, but the 
cucumbers should be added at the last moment. Canned 
salmon may be used. If it is, use the butter sparingly. 

Sandwiches of Fillets of Sole, Lobster, or Salmon 

Cook the fillets of sole in a saucepan with a little clarified 
butter, pepper, salt, and lemon juice. When done, put them in 
press between two dishes. When cold, divide each fillet into 
four pieces, trim, and put in a bowl with a French dressing 
made of white pepper, salt, vinegar, and oil. Have some small 
oval rolls at hand, cut off the tops and remove the crumbs, 
moisten the bottom of each roll with a little of the dressing, 
place a piece of sole on this, add a little mayonnaise sauce, 
cover with the tops, and serve. Sandwiches of lobster and 



266 MRS. seely's cook book 

salmon are prepared in the same manner. If desired each one 
may have a little finely chopped onion sprinkled over it before 
the mayonnaise is added. 

Sardine Sandwiches 

Take as many boneless sardines as are required, open each 
one lengthwise, being careful not to break them, and place the 
halves on a fine wire broiler. When they have broiled a little 
on each side, set them away to cool. When cold, squeeze a 
little lemon juice over them, and cut off the tails. If fresh 
butter is used on the bread, sprinkle a little salt over the sar- 
dines while they are hot. Allow two halves to a triangle of 
bread, and make according to directions. Ordinary canned 
sardines may be used without broiling, but they are apt to be 
very oily. 

Sandwiches a la Victoria 

Have at hand one dozen or more very small, round rolls, 
cut a small piece from the end of each one, remove the crumbs, 
and fill with the following mixture : Remove the white meat 
from one good-sized cooked chicken, have almost as much ham 
as you have chicken, and freshen eight anchovies and drain 
them. Chop all very fine and mix thoroughly. Add enough 
mayonnaise, flavored with a few chopped chives, to make 
a thick paste. Fill each roll, replace the ends, and serve 
on a folded napkin. Lobster may be used in place of the 
chicken. 

Baskets of Olives 

First have hard-boiled eggs from the end of which you chip 
a piece so that the egg will stand. Halve the eggs. Next 
pound to a paste in a mortar the flesh of olives, a quarter as 
much ham and chicken, butter to help the paste, and the yolks 
of the whites you purpose to use as baskets. 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 267 

Having well mixed these, stand the whites in a dish, fill up 
their hollows with the mixture, heaping it high and rounding 
it over mountain form with a spoon, drop over the baskets any 
piquant sauce you like, and serve. In the mixture allow about 
three olives to two eggs. 

Baked Eggs 

Take six eggs, two tablespoonfuls of chopped chicken, two 
tablespoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, one tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley, one-half teaspoonful of ground mace, salt 
to taste, and a very small dash of cayenne pepper. Boil the 
eggs fifteen minutes, remove the shells, cut them in half, 
remove the yolks, and mash them fine. Add all the other 
ingredients, mix thoroughly, and fill the hollowed whites. Heap 
in pyramid shape, brush over with yolk of raw egg, and put 
in the oven to brown. While they are browning, broil a slice 
of ham and cut it in as many squares as you have eggs. Make 
a cream sauce, serve the eggs on the squares of ham, and pour 
the sauce round them. 

Egg Chops with Tomato Sauce 

Mix one-half cup of finely chopped ham and one-half cup 
of finely chopped chicken with enough white sauce to keep 
them together. Form them in the shape of good-sized lamb 
chop. Chop four hard-boiled eggs very fine and season them 
with a little salt and white pepper. Mix with enough white 
sauce to make them the same consistency as the chicken and 
ham and give them the same shape. Place one on the top of 
each ham and chicken chop, dip in beaten egg, and roll in 
cracker crumbs, then in egg and cracker crumbs again. Fry 
in deep hot fat. When brown, drain on brown paper. Arrange 
on platter. Pour tomato sauce round the edge and serve. 
Have extra tomato sauce in sauc^-boat.

Egg Croquettes 

Cool six hard-boiled eggs, chop them very fine, and season 
them with a little salt and white pepper. Mix them with 
enough white sauce to make them keep together and form 
them into croquettes. Roll them in beaten egg, then in 
cracker crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat. Garnish with pars- 
ley and serve white sauce in sauce-boat. 

Devilled Eggs 

Take twelve eggs, one teaspoonful of French mustard, two 
tablespoonfuls of cold tongue chopped fine, one tablespoonful 
of olive oil, one-half teaspoonful of onion juice, and salt and red 
pepper to taste. Boil the eggs fifteen minutes and place them 
in cold water; this prevents them from turning dark. Take 
off the shells, cut lengthwise, and remove the yolks, being 
careful not to break the white. Rub the yolks to a smooth 
paste with the mustard and oil, then add the chopped tongue, 
salt, and red pepper. Mix thoroughly, fill the hollowed whites 
with this mixture, and serve on a bed of water-cress or salad. 

Eggs in Nest of Spinach 

Boil four quarts of spinach, chop it very fine, season with 
salt and pepper, rub it through a puree sieve, mix it with a 
little butter, and add more salt and pepper if necessary. Do 
not have it too moist. Have at hand some very finely cooked 
ham and some veloute sauce. Cut some rings of bread. 
Spread the spinach on the bottom and sides of each one. 
Break an egg in the centre of each one. Place in the oven, 
cook for a few minutes. Mix the chopped ham and veloute 
sauce to a very thick cream, spread over the top, replace in the 
oven, and cook five or six minutes more. Serve with a cream 
sauce. 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 269 

Eggs a la Suisse 

Spread the bottom of dish with fresh butter, cover this 
with thin slices of Gruyere cheese, break eight eggs over the 
cheese, the same as for poaching, season with salt and white 
pepper, then pour a scant gill of very thick cream on the sur- 
face, sprinkle with Gruyere cheese, and bake in hot oven for 
fifteen minutes. Rub a salamander over the top, serve with 
thin pieces of dry toast. 

Egg Balls 

See Mock-turtle Soup, p. 82. 

Egg Timbale 

Break six eggs in a bowl, season with salt and white pepper, 
whip until very light, add one gill of cream, and pour in small 
buttered timbale moulds. Place the mould in a pan of water 
and then in an oven, and poach the eggs until firm. Invert 
the moulds on hot platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with 
Bechamel sauce. 

Curried Eggs 

Mix two tablespoons of corn-starch or wheat flour, a pinch 
of salt, and two teaspoons of curry to a smooth paste with a 
little milk, and pour into one scant quart of boiling milk. 
Stir until the mixture thickens. Then having carefully broken 
your eggs, slip them into the boiling milk. Let them cook 
until the white sets, which will be about two and a half min- 
utes. Then lift the eggs out with a ladle, la} r each on a bit of 
toast neatly trimmed, pour over it a good ladleful of the curry 
and milk, — enough, that is, for the toast to absorb, — and serve 
hot. 

Poached Eggs 

The beauty of a poached egg is to have the yolk blushing 
through the white. Have a pan of fresh boiling water, break 



270 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

the egg in a saucer, pull the pan to one side, drop in the eggs, 
one at a time. Then stand the pan over a moderate fire. As 
soon as the water boils, the eggs are done. Remove, trim off 
the ragged edges, and serve on hot buttered toast. 

Poached Eggs with Mushrooms 

Put a quarter of a pound of mushrooms in a saucepan. Add 
salt, pepper, a little lemon juice, and a tablespoon of butter. 
After the mixture has cooked slowly for fifteen minutes, add a 
third of a wine-glass of wine and a gill of Bechamel sauce, and 
boil for a moment longer. 

Pour the sauce in the midst of ten or twelve freshly poached 
eggs, heaping the mushrooms in a mound in the centre. If the 
mushrooms are of the button variety, a button may be placed 
in the centre of each egg. 

To boil and poach Eggs, according to Directions issued by the 
Department of Agriculture of the United States 

" The directions given for preparing soft-cooked, medium- 
cooked, and hard-cooked eggs vary. The methods described 
in standard cookery books without doubt give the desired 
results if sufficient care is exercised. The chief difficulty 
encountered by most cooks is to secure uniform results, espe- 
cially with soft-cooked and medium-cooked eggs. It must be 
remembered that such results cannot be expected when condi- 
tions vary. The time of cooking, the amount of water used, 
the number, size, and freshness of the eggs, and the kind of 
vessels used are important factors. Thus, eggs which have 
been kept in an ice-chest require more heat to warm them 
before cooking begins than do those which have been kept at 
room temperature. Again, so apparently trivial a detail as 
the sort of vessel used (whether earthen or metal) or the place 
where the vessel stands during cooking may produce very dif- 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 271 

ferent results. Many persons prefer to have eggs cooked at table 
in a chafing-dish or other suitable vessel. In such cases the con- 
ditions may be controlled with comparative ease, and uniform re- 
sults obtained with a little practice if sufficient care is observed. 

"The following methods of preparing soft-cooked and 
medium-cooked eggs have been found to give uniform results 
in laboratory tests at the University of Illinois : Using a gran- 
iteware stewpan of one quart capacity, one pint of water was 
heated over a gas flame; when the water boiled the gas was 
turned off, and an egg which had been kept in a refrigerator 
was dropped into the water. Without disturbing the vessel 
it was covered closely, and the egg allowed to remain in the 
water six minutes. It was then soft-cooked. As shown by 
tests when the egg was dropped into the water, the temperature 
fell almost at once to 185° F., and then slowly to 170-171° F. 
If the egg remained in the water eight minutes, it was medium- 
cooked. In this case the temperature of the water at the end 
of the cooking period had fallen to 162-164° F. 

" Uniform results can be obtained in the kitchen as well as 
in the laboratory if sufficient attention is given to detail. Bear- 
ing clearly in mind the end desired, each cook must experiment 
for herself, as it is impossible to give directions which will 
apply to all cases. 

" The same changes which have been noted above as taking 
place in egg yolk and white, when heat is applied, in preparing 
boiled eggs, take place when other methods of cooking are fol- 
lowed, though they are not always apparent. 

" Poached or dropped eggs are removed from the shell and 
then cooked in water. Thudichum recommends the use of 
salted water to which a very little vinegar has been added. 
The reason for this is, perhaps, that acetic acid (vinegar) tends 
to precipitate albumen, that is, to prevent a loss due to some 
of the egg being dissolved in the water. Flavor may also be 
one of the objects sought."

Scrambled Eggs on Canapes 

Select four large, heavy mushrooms and four a little 
smaller. Remove the stems, peel, wash and dry, and chop 
them very fine. Put one tablespoonful of butter in a pan, and 
when it has melted add one teaspoonful of finely chopped green 
onions. Cook slowly for three minutes, but do not let them 
brown. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook two or three 
minutes more. Stir constantly, adding one tablespoonful of 
finely chopped parsley. Cook for a few minutes. Season with 
half a saltspoonful of salt and one-quarter of a saltspoonful of 
white pepper. Remove from the range, stir in a small piece 
of fresh butter. Mix thoroughly, then add six eggs, one salt- 
spoonful of salt, and half a one of pepper. Beat briskly for one 
minute. Pour in a hot saucepan with half a tablespoonful of 
butter and stir constantly over a slow fire for three or four min- 
utes. The mixture must be in small pieces and cooked quite rare. 
Have ready the eight mushrooms broiled. Arrange the larger 
of the broiled mushrooms on thin slices of warm bread. Fill 
each one with the egg, cover with the smaller boiled mushrooms. 

This dish must be served very hot and the mushrooms must 
be cooked first, as the eggs must be served as soon as they are 
cooked. 

Scrambled Eggs with Peas 

Take six eggs, one tablespoon of butter, three tablespoons 
of milk, salt and pepper to taste, and one-half pint of cooked 
peas. Heat the butter and milk in an omelette pan. Break 
the eggs in a pan and stir till the mixture thickens. Have 
the peas very hot in another pan. Drain off all the liquid 
from the peas. Stir them in the eggs, season, and serve hot. 

Plain Omelette 
Beat separately the yolks and whites of eight eggs until 
very light. Then mix them together thoroughly, add a little 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 273 

salt and white pepper, and one tablespoonful of cream. Heat 
the omelette pan, put a good-sized piece of butter in, and, 
when it has become boiling hot, pour in the eggs. Slightly 
shake the pan until the eggs begin to stiffen. When suffi- 
ciently brown, fold double and serve at once. When an ome- 
lette stands, it becomes heavy. 

Oyster Omelette 

Chop one dozen large, fresh oysters in small pieces, 
sprinkle half a teaspoonful of salt over them, and let them 
stand in their own liquor, in a cool place, for half an hour. 
Beat six eggs, the yolks and whites apart; the former to a 
smooth paste, the latter to a solid froth. Add to the yolks a 
tablespoonful of rich, sweet cream, pepper and salt in sufficient 
quantity, and then lightly stir in the whites. Put an ounce 
and a half of butter in a hot frying pan, and, when it is thor- 
oughly melted and begins to fry, pour in the egg mixture, and 
add as quickly as possible the oysters. Do not stir, but with 
a long-bladed omelette knife lift, as the eggs set, the omelette 
from the pan, to prevent its scorching. In five minutes it will 
be done. Place a hot dish, bottom upward, over the omelette, 
and dexterously turn the pan over, having the brown side of 
the omelette uppermost upon the dish. Serve without delay. 

Spanish Omelette 

Take one teaspoonful of chopped onion and one tablespoon- 
ful of green pepper. Be sure both are chopped very fine and 
cook them until they are a delicate brown. Scald and remove 
the skins of three tomatoes, cut up and add to the mixture. 
Cook all for ten minutes, or until the tomatoes are done. 
Break six eggs in a bowl, beat them well and season. Mix in 
about one-half of the tomato, pepper, and onion. Put one 
tablespoonful of butter in an omelette pan and let it come to a 
boil. Put in the egg mixture ; and when it begins to set, put 



274 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

in the centre the rest of the tomato mixture. Fold it over and 
turn on to a hot platter. Pour some of the tomato sauce 
round it and garnish with fried bread. 

Tomato Omelette 
Make the omelette as above directed and have at hand a 
pan of finely stewed and seasoned tomatoes. Just before turn- 
ing, spread one-half the omelette thickly with the tomatoes. 
Drop over the other side of the omelette and serve at once. 

Egg Marmalade, a Jewish Receipt 
Clarify one pound of sugar in half a pint of water till it 
becomes a thick syrup. While clarifying it, add one ounce of 
sweet almonds, blanched and pounded. Let the mixture cool 
and then stir in gently the yolks of twenty eggs, which have 
been previously well beaten and passed through a sieve. Take 
care to stir continually the same way. When well mixed, 
place over a slow fire, stirring all the time to prevent burning. 
Flavor with vanilla or what you please. Wine or brandy 
might be used for flavor. 

Eggs en Gocotte 
Take two shallots, one onion, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
two tablespoonfuls of mushrooms, one tablespoonful of parsley, 
one-half cup of bouillon. Chop the shallots and onions very 
fine. Put butter in saucepan; and when it is melted, stir in 
shallots and onions. Cook slowly for five minutes. Add the 
mushrooms, parsley, and bouillon, and boil five minutes more. 
Put one tablespoonful of the mixture into a baking shell, 
break an egg in each one, then cover with the mixture, and 
bake in a hot oven for four minutes. 

Nested Eggs 
Take as many eggs as you want nested and strain off the 
whites, being very careful not to break the yolk, which you

SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 275 

leave in the shell. Set the shells holding the yolks in a cool 
place until you are ready to use them. Take as many rounds 
of toast as you have nests to make. Spread with pounded 
chicken livers, beat the whites to a very stiff froth, heap on 
the toast, then make a hollow in the centre. Carefully drop 
in the yolks. Set in a very hot oven for three minutes, or 
until they are a very light brown. Sprinkle a little chopped 
parsley over each one and serve. 

Egg Baskets 

From hard-boiled eggs cut a thin slice off either end so 
that the halves will stand upright. Having halved the eggs, 
mix the yolks with some finely chopped ham, or chicken, or 
tongue, allowing a tablespoonful of the meat to a yolk, and 
mix smoothly together with salt, pepper, mustard, and melted 
butter. Form the paste into balls, which will be about the 
size of the original yolk, and lay in the hard basket-form 
whites. Pour over all a white sauce, set in the oven for a 
few moments, and send to the table garnished with parsley. 

Stuffed Eggs 

Let the eggs boil until they are hard and cut them in half. 

Take out the yolks and mix them with cold chicken, chopped 

very fine, pepper, salt, a piece of butter, and parsley, if you 

choose. Place the mixture in the hard whites, uniting the two 

parts ; roll in the white of an egg and drop into hot fat and 

fry till light brown. Take them from the fat and drain. 

Make a sauce of cream or rich milk, thickened with flour, add 

the yolk of an egg, stir till smooth, pour over the eggs and 

serve. 

Eggs en Marinade 

Take six eggs, one pint of tarragon vinegar, twenty-four 
whole cloves, half a teaspoonful of mustard, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper. Boil the eggs fifteen 



276 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

minutes. Remove the shells and stick four cloves in each egg. 
Pat the vinegar on to boil, rub the mustard, salt, and pepper 
to a paste, and add to the vinegar. When boiling, cook one 
minute. Put the eggs in a glass fruit jar, pour over the boil- 
ing vinegar, cover and let stand for two weeks. These are 
nice to serve as an accompaniment to broiled steak. 

Pickled Eggs 

Boil the eggs from twenty minutes to half an hour. Re- 
move the shells and put them in an earthen jar. Cover them 
with hot vinegar, in which has been boiled peppers, allspice, 
coriander seeds, cardamom, and cloves (half an ounce to two 
dozen eggs), or merely use plain, hot vinegar, and let them 
stand twenty-four hours before using. 

Creamed Cheese Balls to serve with Salad 

Chop very fine one small, green pepper, which has been 
parboiled, and core and seeds removed, and a very little 
pimento. Put in a mortar one-half pound of cream cheese, 
work until it is creamy, then add the chopped mixture, a dash 
of cayenne, and one teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar. Work 
into long strips about an inch in thickness. Put in the ice-box 
to harden. Have some nice, finely shredded celery, one red 
apple cut the same way, one cup of mayonnaise dressing. 
Arrange nice, crisp leaves of lettuce round your .bowl, then set 
in the celery and apple already mixed with the mayonnaise. 
With scissors cut the cheese mixture into little balls all round 
the dish. 

Cheese Croquettes to serve with Salad 

Mix one tablespoonful of melted butter and one tablespoon- 
ful of flour with one teacup of milk. Place on the fire to let it 
come to a boil. Season to taste and stir in the beaten yolks 
of two eggs. Set away to cool. When thoroughly cold, mix 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 277 

with two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese — American or Par- 
mesan — and a dash of cayenne. Form into croquettes, dip 
into beaten egg, roll in fine cracker crumbs, and fry in hot fat. 

Cheese Timbale 

Mix one cup of cream, one tablespoonful of butter, and two 
tablespoonfuls of flour together, and stir over a moderate fire 
until the mixture comes to a boil, then stir in five tablespoon- 
fuls of grated Parmesan cheese. Strain through a puree sieve 
and set away. When cold, stir in three well-beaten eggs and 
salt and white pepper to taste. Grease some small timbale 
moulds. Decorate the inside with truffles. Pour the mixture 
in, then set in pan of water, and bake in hot oven for ten 
minutes. Serve with cheese sauce. 

Pot Cheese 

Place over the fire a pan of milk which has soured and 
thickened. When it has become scalding hot, ladle the curd 
and whey into a muslin bag, and hang up the bag to drain for 
an hour or two. Then take the curd from the bag, moisten 
with thick cream, mix in a small quantity of salt, work well 
with the hands, and either form in a mound, in a glass dish, or 
roll in balls. Keep well covered, in a cool place, and serve 
cold. 

Fondue of Parmesan Cheese 

Mix two ounces of flour with two ounces of butter, a very 
little salt and white pepper, and half a pint of milk. Stir over 
the fire until it boils. Work it quickly with the spoon until it 
is perfectly smooth, then add six ounces of Parmesan cheese 
and the well-beaten yolks of six eggs. Whip the whites quite 
firm and lightly stir them in. Fill a souffle case with this 
mixture. Bake in quick oven and send to the table as soon as 
it is ready. 



278 MBS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

Golden Buck 

Heat one egg in a small saucepan. Add to it five ounces of 
soft American cheese broken in small bits, one level table- 
spoonful of butter, one-third of a teaspoonful of salt, a level 
teaspoonful of mustard, a dash of cayenne pepper, and five table- 
spoonfuls of milk. Toast five slices of bread, keep them warm. 
Place the saucepan containing the cheese mixture into another 
of boiling water and stir constantly until the cheese is almost 
creamy. Set the pan where the contents will keep warm and 
yet not cook any more. Poach or drop ten eggs in boiling 
salted water. Spread the cheese mixture on the toast, arrange 
on a warm dish, putting two poached eggs on each slice of 
toast. Serve at once. 

Gherkin Buck 

Convert into a soft pulp, by a constant stirring in a saucepan 
over a fire, a half pound or so of good American cheese well 
sprinkled with pepper and wet with ale. To a pound of cheese 
allow a teacup of ale. When very hot, which will be in from 
three to five minutes, pour over hot toast, and upon the top of 
each piece of toast lay a thin slice of broiled bacon. Serve hot. 

Ramekins, a Jewish Dish 

Mix together three eggs, one ounce of warmed butter, and 
two ounces of a fine cheese grated. Bake in small patty pans. 

Welsh Rarebit 

One pound of soft American cheese, one tablespoonful of 
butter, one-half teaspoonful of dry mustard, one-fourth salt- 
spoonful of cayenne, one tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, 
one gill of beer, and some slices of toast. Put the seasoning, 
butter, and beer in the chafing dish. When the butter is melted, 
add the cheese cut in small dice, — to grate it is better, — stir 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 279 

all the time, and add a little more beer if it is needed. When 
the cheese is melted and creamy, serve at once on the toast. 
Milk may be used in place of beer. 

Welsh Rarebit 

Take four ounces of cheese, half an ounce of butter, a spoon- 
ful of made mustard, two tablespoonfuls of cream, cayenne and 
black pepper to taste. 

Grate or chop the cheese in a bowl and rub all the ingre- 
dients to a uniform paste, adding a tablespoonful of milk, ale, 
porter, beer, or Champagne. Make a slice of rather thick toast. 
Dip it an instant in boiling water and place in the oven. 

Transfer the prepared cheese mixture to a saucepan and 
stir over a gentle heat until melted, then heat up quickly and 
pour upon the toast, and serve. 

Swiss Rarebit 

Take as many eggs as you wish — the number being based 
on the number of your guests — and weigh them. For your 
cheese take a third of the weight of the eggs and for butter a 
sixth of the weight of the eggs. Beat the eggs in a saucepan, 
grate or cut in small pieces the cheese, add that to the eggs, 
stirring all the time, and then add the butter. Stir well over a 
good fire until the mixture is thick and smooth. Add little 
salt, a large dash of pepper, and serve in a hot dish. This is 
best cooked in a double kettle. 

Forcemeat of Bread 

Cook two finely chopped onions with one ounce of butter for 
five minutes. Soak one loaf of stale bread in water for half 
an hour. Squeeze it dry and put it in a bowl with three raw 
eggs, one tablespoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of white pep- 
per, a tablespoonful of sage, a scant half teacupf ul of grated nut-

Forcemeat of Chicken 
Remove the raw white meat from a tender fowl weighing 
about four pounds. Mortar the meat well and rub through a 
fine sieve. Weigh it. There should be about half a pound. 
Place it in a mortar and in small portions rub in two table- 
spoonfuls of butter. Stir until it is well mixed. Then add 
the beaten whites of four eggs, one teaspoonful of salt, a quarter 
of a teaspoonful of white pepper, and a dash of cayenne. Then 
add one pint of whipped cream, measuring it after it is whipped. 
Mix well and put on ice for one hour. This forcemeat may be 
used many ways, — for borders, covering chops, tongue, quenelle, 
or to stuff boned squab. 

Chicken Forcemeat Balls 
See Mock Turtle Soup, p. 80. 

Forcemeat of Chicken Liver 
Have at hand six chicken livers, one pint of cream or 
chicken stock, one-half pint of stale bread crumbs, three eggs, 
one tablespoonful of salt, one-sixth of a teaspoonful of pepper, 
eight tablespoonfuls of butter, and one-eighth of a teaspoonful 
of ground mace. Wash the livers, put them in a pan, and cover 
with boiling water. Let them boil for half an hour. When 
cold, pound to a smooth paste and rub through a puree sieve. 
Mix the bread crumbs and cream together and cook them slowly 
until a smooth paste is formed. Remove from the fire, add the 
butter to the paste, let it cool slowly, then add the liver, season- 
ing, and the eggs which have been well beaten. Mix thoroughly 
and set away to cool.

with their proportion of fine bread crumbs. Season with salt, 
pepper, and some spice like nutmeg, if you wish, and mix in 
last the yolks of eggs — enough to make the stuffing plastic. 
Roll it in any agreeable form, fry it in butter, and use it as a 
garnish for poultry or game.

CHAPTER XI 

HOT PUDDINGS, CUSTARDS, SOUFFLES, ETC. 

Almond Pudding, a Jewish Receipt 

Beat up the yolks of ten eggs and the whites of seven. Add 
half a pound of sweet almonds pounded finely, half a pound of 
white sugar, half an ounce of bitter almonds, and a tablespoon- 
ful of orange-flower water. When thoroughly mixed, put in a 
well-buttered pudding dish and bake in a brisk oven. Before 
serving, strew powdered sugar over the top, or pour over clari- 
fied sugar with orange-flower water. 

Baked Apples 

Wash the apples and core them with an apple corer. Set 
them in a deep pan, sift over them sugar enough to make quite 
sweet, and fill the pan half full of water. Turn them over after 
baking a short time and bake slowly in a steady oven an hour 
to an hour and a half. Set a pan of water in the upper oven 
when you put the apples in the stove. 

Buttered Apples 
Pare six or eight apples of a firm flesh but of a good cooking 
sort and an agreeable tart. Cut out the core without piercing 
the outer flesh and fill in the centre with fresh butter. Set the 
apples in a porcelain-lined stewpan just large enough to hold 
them in a single layer, add a little water and stew them gently, 
turning them if necessary. When they are tender and quite 
done through, strew upon them as much sugar as will sweeten 
the dish highly, adding a teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon. 

284

earthen baking dish, sweeten and spice to taste, cover with 
water. Lay a cover on the baking dish and bake the apples till 
tender. 

Old-fashioned Boston Apple Pudding 

Peel a dozen and a half of good tart apples and take out the 
cores, cut them small and put them in a porcelain stewpan that 
will just hold them with a little water, a little cinnamon, two 
cloves, and the peel of a lemon. Stew over a slow fire till quite 
soft, then sweeten with sugar and pass through a sieve. Add 
the yolks of four eggs and the white of one, a quarter of a 
pound of good butter, half a nutmeg, the peel of a lemon grated, 
and the juice of a lemon. Beat all well together, line the inside 
of a deep pie dish with puff paste, put in the pudding, and bake 
half an hour. 

Apple Meringue, Plain 

Peel, core, and slice ten or twelve good-sized apples. Cook 
them until they are of a good consistency with three ounces of 
granulated sugar, two ounces of butter, and the chopped rind of 
a lemon. When thoroughly cooked, shape in a dome form and 
cover with meringue. Fill a pastry bag with meringue and 
decorate the surface. Sprinkle with sugar and bake in a mod- 
erate oven until a delicate brown. Decorate with currant jelly. 

Bread Pudding 

Take a loaf of French bread and cut it in thin slices. But- 
ter and mix the slices with four ounces of raisins and two 



286 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

ounces of citron cut in fine shreds. Boil a pint and a half of 
milk with six ounces of granulated sugar. Remove from the 
fire and add the well-beaten yolks of six eggs and a little finely- 
chopped lemon rind. Strain the mixture over the bread, let it 
stand for ten minutes, and bake in pudding dish for half an hour 
until it is light brown. Serve hot with any kind of pudding 
sauce. 

Bread Pudding 

Soak a pint of fine bread crumbs in a pint of milk, and when 
soft add three tablespoons of cocoa well mixed with a little 
water. To another pint of milk add half a cup of sugar and 
three well-beaten eggs. Blend all the ingredients and add half 
a teaspoon of salt. Pour into a well-buttered pudding dish, 
set the dish in a pan of hot water, and bake an hour. Serve 
with a cream either whipped or not whipped, and flavored with 
vanilla. 

Cabinet Pudding 

Have at hand one and a half ounces of candied orange peel, 
four dozen sultana raisins, four ounces of currants, one pint of 
milk, four eggs, the grated rind of one lemon, three tablespoon- 
f uls of granulated sugar, and a few slices of sponge cake. Rub 
a pudding mould with melted butter. Then cut the orange 
peel into thin slices and arrange in the bottom of the mould. 
Fill in the spaces with raisins and currants. Arrange a few 
slices of sponge cake, moisten them with a few drops of melted 
butter, and sprinkle them with currants. Proceed in this 
manner until the mould is nearly full. Mix the milk with the 
grated lemon rind, sugar, the eggs, which should be well beaten, 
and a little bit of grated nutmeg. Strain and pour into the 
mould, which should be quite full. Tie a piece of buttered 
paper over it and let it stand for two hours. Then tie it 
tightly in a cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and cook for 
one hour. Remove from the water, let it stand a minute or

two, and then remove the cloth. Invert it on a dish, and serve 
with sweet sauce in a separate dish. In place of the lemon 
rind, any desired flavoring may be used, and it will be much 
richer if cream is used instead of milk. 

Cream of Chestnuts with Caramel Sugar 

Cook tender, in enough water to cover them, one pound of 
shelled and peeled chestnuts with a scant one-quarter of a va- 
nilla bean. When cool, pound them in a mortar and rub through 
a puree sieve. Mix with the well-beaten yolks of four eggs, 
five entire eggs well beaten, half a pound of granulated sugar, 
and one pint of milk. Mix thoroughly and again rub through 
a puree sieve. Cover the bottom of a timbale mould with one 
gill of caramel sugar. When cold, butter the sides of the 
mould and fill it with the chestnut mixture. Set the mould in 
a pan with hot water to half its height. Place it on top of the 
range, and when the cream comes to a boil, cover it with a 
paper, and set the pan in a slack oven where the mixture will 
cook without boiling for one hour, or until it is firm to the 
touch in the centre of mould. Serve, pouring over it the cara- 
mel sugar, which is in the bottom of the mould. 

To make Caramel Sugar 

Mix one pound of granulated sugar with a gill of cold water, 
boil over a brisk fire until it has passed the clear brittle state, 
and is a light brown. Place in a pan of cold water to prevent 
its turning any darker. Use as soon as possible. 

Chestnut Pudding 

Boil twenty-five chestnuts, remove the shells, and rub the 
pulp through a sieve. Mix with one-half pint of cream two 
ounces of butter, three ounces of granulated sugar, and a little 
salt and vanilla to taste. Stir these ingredients over the fire 



288 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

until the preparation begins to thicken, then stir it briskly to 
prevent it from sticking to the pan. As soon as it leaves the 
sides of the pan, remove from the fire, and add the well-beaten 
yolks of four eggs and the whites of three eggs whipped firm. 
Butter a plain mould and fill it with the mixture, fastening the 
cover on securely. Steam for one hour and a half. When 
cooked, invert it on a dish, pour some warm diluted apricot jam 
over it and serve. 

Chocolate Blanc-mange 

Soak seven sheets of sheet gelatine in half a cup of cold 
water. Boil together for five minutes one quart of hot milk, 
one cup of sugar, two ounces of grated chocolate, and a little salt. 
Flavor with vanilla after adding the dissolved gelatine, stirring 
constantly. Wet the mould with cold water, pour in, and set 
away to harden. 

Chocolate Pudding 

Soak one pint of bread crumbs in one quart of milk. See 
that the bread is thoroughly dissolved. Mix one ounce of 
grated chocolate with three tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar 
and one tablespoonful of boiling water. Stir constantly over a 
brisk fire until it becomes smooth. Remove from the fire, stir 
in a few spoonfuls of bread and milk. Stir until it is smooth, 
and then mix with the rest of the bread and milk. Beat the 
yolks of four eggs and the white of one egg together, and mix 
with one-quarter of a cup of granulated sugar and one teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Stir into the bread mixture. Pour into a pudding 
dish and bake in slow oven for forty minutes. Beat the whites 
of three eggs to a stiff froth, stir in three tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar, and flavor with vanilla extract. Spread this 
over the pudding and bake twenty minutes longer with the 
oven door open. Whipped cream is very nice served as a 
sauce. This pudding may be served hot or cold.

Chocolate Pudding 

To a little more than a pint of milk add three tablespoons 
of grated chocolate and beat together in a double boiler. 
When thoroughly heated, add two tablespoons of corn-starch 
wet with a little cold milk. Take from the fire and add the 
yolks of four eggs in which a cup of sugar has been beaten, 
put in a pudding pan, set this pan in another pan of hot water, 
and bake in the oven till the eggs are set. Make a meringue 
of the whites of the eggs and one cup of sugar, spread over the 
top, and brown. Vanilla flavoring should be used in the pud- 
ding and meringue. 

Coooanut Custard 

Boil one quart of milk, and at the boiling-point add three 
tablespoonfuls of corn flour, blended in a little water. Remove 
the saucepan from the fire and stir in one-quarter of a pound 
of butter. Let it stand until perfectly cold. Beat up sepa- 
rately the yolks and whites of six eggs until very light. To 
the beaten yolks add three-quarters of a pound of sugar and the 
grated pulp of one cocoanut. Put this mixture into the milk 
with the whites of the eggs. Line a dish or dishes with pie 
pastry, fill with the custard, and bake. Serve hot. 

Cocoanut Pudding 

In one boiling quart of milk gradually stir a scant three- 
quarters of a cup of farina. Let this boil fifteen minutes, then 
add one cup of grated cocoanut and three well-beaten eggs. 
Stir briskly to prevent the eggs curdling. Butter a melon 
mould and line with very fine bread crumbs. Pour the mix- 
ture into it, place the mould in a pan of water, and bake in a 
moderate oven for three-quarters of an hour. Serve hot with 
wine sauce.

Let one quart of milk come to a boil. Cool the milk 
a little, pour it gradually over six well-beaten eggs, stir- 
ring all the while. Add a pinch of salt and sugar to taste. 
Pour into a deep pan. Grate nutmeg thick over the top. Set 
the pan in the oven in another pan in which is water. Set a 
square pan of water in the upper oven. Bake in a moderate 
heat a light brown. When done, a knife will come out clear. 

Custard Caramel 

Mix one cup of granulated sugar, half a cup of water, and 
two teaspoonfuls of vinegar together. Boil until, when tested 
in cold water, it hardens. When partially cool, line an oval 
mould with the mixture. Make a custard of one quart of milk, 
six eggs, and vanilla to taste. Fill the mould. Bake in mod- 
erate oven till firm to touch. Save the caramel that is left after 
lining the mould, thin it with water, and when the custard is 
inverted on the dish, pour the liquid over it. 

Compote of Green Currants 

Simmer until tender one pint of green currants (stripped from 
the stalks) in a syrup made of half a pint of water and five 
ounces of sugar. Boil the syrup before adding the currants.

Serve with boiled rice and a dish of pulverized sugar, if more 
sweetness is wished 

Compotes of other fruits may be used in this way, such as 
green apricots cherries, damson plums. The sugar must be 
in proportion to the tartness of the fruit. 

Fig Pudding 

Take half a pound of chopped suet, four eggs well beaten, 
one pint of milk or cream, half a pound of figs cut in small 
pieces, one pound of flour, and three teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. Sift the flour and baking powder together, add suet,

serving, have a large deep pan filled with very hot fat. With a 
spoon and the forefinger of the left hand drop large nutmeg- 
sized bits of the paste into the fat, fry slowly until crisp and 
expanded four times the original size. Drain, dish upon a 
folded napkin, sprinkle with sugar, and serve hot. 

Marrow Fritters 
Dip slices of cold marrow pudding in a beaten egg, roll in 
fresh bread crumbs, and fry until light brown in deep hot fat. 
Sprinkle with sugar, and serve separately on a folded napkin 
with Madeira sauce. 

Strawberry Fritters 

Have large, ripe strawberries, roll them in melted peach mar- 
malade or strawberry jam, then in powdered macaroons. Dip 
in sweetened flour batter and fry in deep hot lard. Drain on 
brown paper, roll in powdered sugar, place on a folded napkin, 
and serve. 

Sweet Flour Batter

ing water. Beat till it is light and smooth, and flavor with 
vinegar to taste. Place in a dish and grate nutmeg over the 
top, covering well. 

Indian Meal Pudding, Baked 

Take one pint of new milk, half a pint of water, and mix and 
scald. Turn the hot mixture gradually on six tablespoonf uls of 
meal. Put in a bit of butter the size of an egg, a little salt, 
three tablespoonfuls of sugar, two of molasses, and one egg. 
Beat all together and bake in a slow oven two or more hours. 

Indian Meal Pudding, Boiled 

Take two cups of Indian meal, one cup of wheat flour, two 
eggs, salt, and sour or buttermilk to make a batter, which should 
not be too thick, but rather thin, to allow for the swelling of the 
meal. Boil about three hours in a pudding boiler. 

The best sauce for this pudding is scraped maple sugar and 
cream. By some a thick sour cream is preferred. 

Lamplioh, a Jewish Receipt 

Mix together half a pound of currants, the same quantity of 
raisins and sugar, a little citron, ground cloves, and cinnamon, 
and eight apples finely chopped. Have ready a rich puff paste 
cut in small triangles. Fill the pieces with the fruit, bringing 
the edges of the paste together, and lay them like puffs in a 
deep dish, putting them closely together. When the dish is full, 
pour over one ounce of fresh butter melted in a teacup of clari- 
fied sugar and flavored with essence of lemon. Bake in an 
oven not too brisk.

Marrow Pudding with Sauce 

Chop fine one pound and a half of beef marrow and twelve 
ounces of fine bread crumbs. Mix them thoroughly with half 
a pound of granulated sugar, half a pound of candied citron, 
candied lemon and orange peel cut in fine shreds, half a pound 
of currants, four well-beaten eggs, half a gill of brandy, one 
gill of Madeira wine. Butter a large round mould not too high, 
fill it with the mixture, and bake on a baking sheet, in a moder- 
ate oven for one hour. Invert on a dish, cover with the follow- 
ing sauce, and serve very hot : — 

Sauce 

Yolks of six eggs, three ounces of sugar, half a pint of 
Madeira wine. Beat the mixture over the fire with an egg- 
beater until it is thick and frothy. Serve at once. 

New England Pandowdy 

Fill a deep pudding dish (the dish should be earthen or 
porcelain lined) with well-peeled and cored apples of a variety 
that will cook up soft and retain a pleasing tart. Put in water 
enough to last during the cooking of the apples and give a 
"juice" for the eating, but not enough to make the compote 
watery. Over the apples lay a baking powder biscuit crust — 
a crust well shortened, but not so saturated with baking powder 
as anxious or careless cooks are apt to make it. Bake in a 
moderate oven till the apples and crust are done. If the crust 
cooks before the apples, invert a pan over the dish, not forget- 
ting a pan of water in the upper oven. Serve with a sauce of 
thick cream into which a cupful of sugar has been beaten, or 
maple sugar is stirred. 

Some cooks dust the apples with sweetening before putting 
on the crust. Peaches may be used instead of apples,

Baked Pears 

With plenty of water stew the pears till tender. Then 
place them in a pan. Add the juice in which they were boiled, 
making the pan more than half full. Set in the oven and bake 
quite soft, turning them once, and always set the pan of water 
in the upper oven to protect the fruit. 

Plum Pudding 

Three pounds of chopped suet, three pounds of brown sugar, 
three pounds of currants, three pounds of sultana raisins, three 
pounds of candied lemon and orange peel, three teaspoonfuls 
of salt, three ounces of mixed ground spices, three pints of 
brandy, one pint of black molasses, one pound and a half of 
bread crumbs, one pound of flour, and twenty eggs. Butter 
the moulds, tie in cloths, and steam six hours. The above 
receipt will fill twelve good-sized moulds. One half or less 
that quantity may be used. After being steamed the puddings 
will keep a long time, if set in a cool place. 

Plum Pudding 

One pound of brown sugar, one pound of raisins, one pound 
of currants, one pound of sultana raisins, one pound of suet, 
half a pound of citron, half a pound orange peel, six large apples, 
five eggs, one large cup of milk, one large cup of flour, one 
small cup of bread crumbs, one pint of Sherry, one pint of 
brandy, one tablespoonful of ground cinnamon, one tablespoon- 
ful of ground cloves, one grated nutmeg, and one teaspoon 
of salt. Chop the suet and apples, which have been peeled, in 
small pieces, cut the large raisins in half, the orange peel in 
small pieces, and slice the citron as thin as possible. Have the 
eggs well beaten. Stir all the ingredients in a stone jar. This 
will make more than one mould. Butter as many moulds as

the yolks of the eggs, beaten in milk, with a little sugar added 
while cooking. 

Pennsylvania Quinces 

Rub the fir thoroughly from the quinces, core them, stuff 
the centre with sugar, put in a baking pan with a little water, 
and bake till tender. If they tend to dry on top, baste and 
cover them with an inverted pan. Serve with a sauce of cream 
flavored with brandy, wine, or vanilla. 

Raised Rum Baba 

Dissolve one compressed yeast cake in half a cup of warm 
water. Let it stand in a warm place for thirty minutes. 
When the yeast floats to the top, add four ounces of flour and 
a little more water to make it a soft batter. Let it stand in 
a warm place till it rises very light. In another bowl place 
one pound of flour, six ounces of butter, and two ounces of 
sugar. Mix thoroughly, and then stir in a pint and a half of 
warm milk which has been boiled and partially cooled. Next 
add the three eggs, one after the other, and one wine-glass of 
rum. Mix well. Add one ounce of currants with three ounces 
of raisins and half an ounce of citron cut in small pieces. Let 
this mixture stand one hour before adding the yeast batter. 
Work them together thoroughly. Fill a well-buttered mould 
about half full, allowing the dough room to swell. Bake in a

itself out. 

Strawberry Shortcake 

Put one quart of sifted flour in a large earthen bowl, add 
to it one-half teaspoonf ul of salt and three heaping teaspoonf uls 
of baking powder. Mix thoroughly, and then cream it with 
two heaping teaspoonfuls of butter. When this is done, stir in 
enough rich milk to make a soft dough. Butter three round 
pans, the same as for layer cake. Roll the dough on a lightly 
floured board until it is half or three-quarters of an inch thick. 
Cut it the same size as the pans and place it in them. Bake in 
a quick oven for eighteen minutes. Remove from the pans ; 
and when partially cool, butter the top of each layer. Prepare 
two quarts of nice ripe strawberries as follows : If necessary, 
wash and drain thoroughly in a colander. Place in an earthen 
bowl and cover them with powdered sugar. It depends upon 
the sweetness of the berry as to the quantity of sugar to use. 
Crush the berries with a potato masher so that they may be 
thoroughly mixed with the sugar. Do not mash them to a 
pulp. Place one layer of cake in a deep round dish, spread 
it with the strawberries, cover with another layer, treat this 
in the same manner ; also the third layer. Garnish the dish 
with whole strawberries and serve with plain rich cream or 
whipped cream.

Strawberry Shortcake of the Oneida Community 

With a quart of flour sift thoroughly three teaspoons of 
baking powder and rub in one ounce of butter and a pinch of 
salt. Wet with a pint of sweet milk, stirring with a spoon. 
Do not roll out the paste, but spread it on tin pie plates, aiding 
by patting with the hand if necessary until the dough is about 
half an inch thick. Bake slowly at first till the cake rises a 
little and then hasten the baking, allowing in all about twenty- 
five minutes for the biscuit to bake. When it is thoroughly 
done, take a sharp knife and split it and spread each half upon 
its soft side with butter. Lay one-half on a generously large 
dish, and over it spread the strawberries which have been 
previously sugared, mashed a little, and mixed with cream. 
Having well covered one-half of the crust, lay on the other half 
and spread berries and cream over it as upon the first. If your 
crust is in small cakes and you have two, make your cake of 
four layers rather than of two. Work fast and don't lose a 
minute, for shortcakes should be served with the quickness of 
griddle cakes. Sweeten the fruit before you begin making the 
dough — say an hour before use. 

Peach Shortcake 

Make precisely as the above, using instead fine luscious 
peaches, peeled and quartered.

cup of sugar, a little salt, any spice you wish, and a few bits of 
butter. Upon this spread a paste made as you make a straw- 
berry shortcrust. Bake until the apples are done and the crust 
is a light brown. Loosen the crust, turn the pudding dish 
upside down over a plate or platter, and have the crust and 
apples inverted. Separate into little squares and serve with 
scraped maple sugar and cream. 

Souffle with Apricot Sauce 
Twelve eggs, one pound of granulated sugar, vanilla to 
taste, and one teaspoonful of corn-starch dissolved in a little 
cold milk. Divide the whites of the eggs from the yolks. Beat 
the eggs till firm and white, then add the sugar, corn-starch, 
and vanilla. Beat thoroughly. Have the yolks well beaten, 
and with a spoon carefully stir them with the whites. Bake 
in souffle dish in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. 

Apricot Sauce 
Stew some apricots, add sugar to taste. When thoroughly 
cooked, rub them through a puree sieve. Strain the syrup, and 
then add a little maraschino or other liqueur to fancy. Serve 
with the souffle. 

Cheese Souffle 

Beat a quarter of a pound of butter, melted with the yolks 
of six eggs. Season with pepper and cook it over a moderate 
fire till it becomes creamy. Be sure to stir it all the time and 
do not let it boil. When it is creamy, take it from the fire and 
mix in three-eighths of a pound of finely grated Swiss cheese 
and Parmesan cheese. Do not have the mixture any thicker. 
Slowly stir in the well-beaten whites of three eggs and then 
stir in two spoonfuls of whipped cream. Pour into the souffle 
pan and put the pan on a flat sheet of tin. Bake in a slack 
oven about ten or fifteen minutes. Before removing from the 
oven, sprinkle well with grated cheese. Serve at once.

been grated very fine. Beat these together for five minutes. 
Beat the whites of the eggs till they are stiff and lightly stir 
them with the yolks. When the mixture is smooth and light, 
pour it into a buttered tin and bake in a quick oven. It must 
be served as soon as it is cooked, else it will fall. 

Lemon Souffle 

To the well-beaten yolks of six eggs add a scant tablespoon- 
ful of powdered sugar. Beat twenty minutes, stir in the juice 
and grated rind of one lemon. Ten minutes before serving, 
beat the whites of six eggs until they are light and add to the 
yolks. Mix thoroughly and pour in a baking dish. Bake in a 
quick oven. When cooked, sprinkle with granulated sugar and 
serve at once. 

Lemon Souffle 

Boil one cup of milk or cream with half a tablespoonful of 
butter. Mix one cup of sifted flour with one cup of boiled 
milk. Stir it into the boiled milk. Keep stirring till all is 
free from the bottom of the saucepan. When cool, stir in half 
a tablespoonful of butter which has been creamed, six table- 
spoonfuls of granulated sugar, and the yolks of eight eggs 
stirred in one by one. Flavor with wine and the juice of one 
lemon. Then add the stiffly beaten whites of eggs. Mix 
thoroughly, pour into dish, and bake for thirty minutes. 

Prune Souffle 
Stew one pound of prunes till very soft. Then rub them 
through a colander and sweeten to taste. Beat the whites of 



HOT PUDDINGS, CUSTARDS, SOUFFLjES, FTC. 303 

six eggs very stiff and add one teaspoonful of vanilla. Now 
add the strained prunes and beat together very thoroughly. 
Pour it into the dish you are to serve it in and bake in moder- 
ate oven for ten minutes. Any fruit may be used instead of 
prunes. 

Custard Souffle 

Rub two scant tablespoons of butter to a cream, add two 
tablespoons of flour, and pour in gradually one cup of hot milk. 
Cook eight minutes in a double boiler, stirring often. Separate 
the yolks and whites of four eggs. Beat the yolks with two 
tablespoons of sugar, add to the milk, and set away to cool. 
Thirty minutes before serving, beat the whites very stiff, cut 
them lightly into the custard, and bake in a buttered dish in a 
moderate oven. 

Cream Sauce 

A quarter of a cup of butter, half a cup of pulverized sugar, 
two tablespoons of wine, and two tablespoons of cream. Cream 
the butter and sugar well, and just before serving place the 
bowl over hot water and stir till smooth and creamy. 

Suet Pudding 

Mix one cupful of finely chopped suet with one cup of sweet 
milk, one cupful of raisins, seeded and rubbed with a little 
flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one small teaspoonful of soda dis- 
solved in one cup of molasses, and three and a half cups of flour. 
Place in buttered mould, cover tightly, and steam three hours. 
Unmould and serve hot, with hard sauce. 

Suet Pudding 

Mix one cup of finely chopped suet with one egg and one 
cup of sweet milk, one cup of seeded raisins dredged with flour, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one cup of molasses, three cups of flour, 
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and ginger to taste. Put 



304 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

in a buttered pudding boiler of tin, cover to exclude all steam 
and water, and boil three hours. Invert the boiler, and serve 
hot with hard sauce or liquid brandy sauce. 

Peach Tapioca 
Pour over one-third of a cup of granulated tapioca enough cold 
water to soften it. Add to a quart of water in a double boiler 
the dissolved tapioca and boil until it is clear. When clear, 
take from the fire and flavor with a little fresh lemon, sugar 
to make quite sweet, and salt so that it will not taste fresh. 
Let the tapioca remain rather thick. Take one can of peaches, 
lay the peaches in a pudding dish, and sift sugar over them. 
Mix the strained juice of the peaches with the tapioca to make 
a proper consistency and pour over the peaches, covering them 
well. Set in a moderate oven and bake five or ten minutes. 
Serve with cream for a sauce. 

Strawberry Tapioca 

Is prepared after the manner of peach tapioca. The straw- 
berries should be set on the stove, sweetened to taste, and scalded 
only a moment or two. Place them in a pudding dish, pouring 
over them the tapioca. Bake five or ten minutes. 

Tapioca Cream 

Boil one quart of milk in a double kettle and add four table- 
spoonfuls of tapioca, which should have been well soaked in 
water. Cook until the tapioca is transparent, adding a good 
pinch of salt. When the tapioca is cooked, take the mixture 
off the fire, and that moment add three eggs well beaten and 
sugar to taste. Any flavoring — bitter almond, vanilla, lemon 
— may be used. 

Tapioca Pudding 

Wash three ounces of tapioca and boil it slowly for fifteen 
minutes with one quart of milk, stirring it occasionally. When 



HOT PUDDINGS, CUSTABDS, SOUFFLES, ETC. 305 

partially cool, add two ounces of butter, one-quarter of a pound 
of granulated sugar, and three well-beaten eggs. Season with 
vanilla. Butter a deep dish, cover the edge with puff paste, 
put the pudding in it, and bake in moderate oven for half an 
hour. 

Virginia Pudding 

Five eggs, one pint of milk, one gill of cream (or an ounce 
of butter), three tablespoons of flour, and a little salt. Reserve 
the white of the eggs for the hard sauce. Bake slowly one 
hour.

Almond Custard 

Scald, blanch, and pound very fine three ounces of almonds 
and only three bitter almonds. Mix thoroughly with eight 
custard cups of boiling cream. Place in a saucepan with the 
yolks of eight eggs, three ounces of granulated sugar, and one 
teaspoon of orange-flower water. Mix well over the fire to keep 
the mixture warm, but do not let it boil. Pour into custard 
cups. Set the cups in a pan with boiling water to half their 
height. Take the froth from the surface with the edge of a 
small piece of paper. Cover and cook slowly for twenty min- 
utes. Let them cool in the pan. Wipe the cups clean and 
dry, and, if desired, serve with a dish of roasted almonds. 

Banana Pudding 

Scald one quart of milk, add the well-beaten yolks of three 
eggs, one tablespoon of corn-starch, and granulated sugar to 
taste. Boil long enough to make a nice thick cream. Thinly 
slice three bananas, arrange in a pudding dish, then pour the 
boiled liquid over them. Make a meringue of the whites of 
the eggs. Cover the top and bake all in moderate oven until 
a nice brown. Serve when it is quite cool. 

Bavaroise with Chestnuts 

Remove the shells from one pound of fresh chestnuts. Put 
them with some water in a saucepan and cook over a slow fire 

306 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 307 

for two hours. When the water becomes black, replace it with 
clean boiling water. When the chestnuts are tender, drain, 
skin, and pound them in a mortar with two gills of sugar syrup, 
reduce to a paste, and pass through a pur^e sieve. Place the 
yolks of four eggs in a bowl and beat them up with four ounces 
of granulated sugar. Boil one pint of milk with half a split 
vanilla bean, remove the bean and pour the milk on the eggs 
and sugar. Place over the fire and beat with a whisk until it 
begins to thicken. Remove and add an ounce and a half of 
gelatine, previously dissolved in a little cold water. When this 
is stirred in, strain it through a sieve and add it to the chestnuts. 
Place the mixture on ice and beat well until cold, then pour it 
into a fancy mould packed in ice. Let it stand for two hours. 
Just before serving, dip in hot water and invert the mould on a 
cold dish, and garnish with chestnuts glazed in the following 
manner : Select the necessary number of chestnuts, cut a small 
slit in each one, arrange on a tin sheet, sprinkle with salt, and 
bake in an oven. When tender and cooled, remove the shells 
and skin. Dip in a syrup composed of one cup of granulated 
sugar and one gill of water, boiled until, when tested in cold 
water, it is brittle. Drain the chestnuts and arrange on oiled 
paper to dry. 

Maraschino Bavarian Cream 

Whip one pint of cream until it is like snow. Take care 
not to overdo it, else it will be butter. Stir in one and a half 
ounces of gelatine which has been dissolved in water and then 
strained. Add one gill and a half of genuine maraschino, the 
juice of one lemon, and four ounces of pounded loaf sugar. 
Mix well together and pour the cream into a mould previously 
oiled slightly with sweet almond oil. Set the mould in cracked 
ice, and, when the cream has become firm, invert on a dish. The 
mould being oiled prevents the necessity of dipping it in warm 
water. 



308 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Vanilla Bavaroise 

Boil one pint of milk with one-half of a split vanilla bean. 
Mix four well-beaten egg yolks with six ounces of sugar, add 
the boiling milk, and stir over a moderate fire without its com- 
ing to a boil. Remove from the fire, and as soon as it begins to 
thicken, take out the vanilla bean and stir in one ounce of gela- 
tine which has been dissolved in a little water. When this is 
melted, pass the whole through a fine wire sieve and let it cool 
on the ice. As it commences to thicken, mix in three pints of 
cream whipped and thoroughly drained. Fill a mould with this 
mixture, cover with a paper the same shape as the top, fasten 
the cover securely, and pack in ice for two or three hours. At 
the last moment dip the mould in hot water and invert on a 
cold dish. 

Chocolate Bavaroise 

A chocolate bavaroise may be made the same as above, 
adding two ounces of chocolate dissolved in a little water just 
before the mixture is strained. 

Biscuit G-laoe 
Mix the yolks of eight eggs with one pint of rich cream and 
four ounces of powdered macaroons, ten ounces of granulated 
sugar, and a very little pinch of salt. Stir the whole in a stew- 
pan over the fire until the egg is sufficiently set or is quite thick. 
Strain through a wet cloth, and when cool add two wine-glasses 
of maraschino. Freeze in the usual way. Just before serving, 
stir in one-half pint of whipped cream. Fill small paper cases 
and sprinkle each one with powdered macaroons. 

Birds'-nest Pudding 

Make an orange jelly. Invert a moderately deep pie dish 

in a round earthen basin — one that will hold about two quarts. 

Pour the jelly into the basin, covering the pie dish. Stand it 

in a cool place to harden. Next cut the orange peel in very 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 309 

narrow strips. Boil one cup of granulated sugar in half a cup 
of water until it hardens when tested ; to test, drop a little in 
cold water. Dip the strips of orange peel in this syrup and 
place on greased paper to harden. Scald one pint of milk and 
stir in four tablespoons of corn-starch blended with a little 
water. Stir constantly while it boils and until it thickens, then 
add one-quarter of a cup of granulated sugar and flavor with 
vanilla. Have ready some eggshells that have been emptied 
from a small hole in the top, fill each one with the liquid and 
set away to harden. They should rest in a pan of meal or flour, 
so as to be upright while hardening. Have ready one pint of 
whipped cream. Turn the jelly out on a round glass dish, care- 
fully remove the pie dish, and garnish around the space left by 
the pie dish with the strips of orange peel. Fill the space inside 
the strips with the whipped cream. Carefully remove the shells 
from the corn-starch eggs and arrange these in the centre, and 
serve. 

Chantilly Pudding 

Beat the yolks of four eggs with one cup of powdered sugar 
until they are very light and creamy, then add the grated rind 
of one lemon. Whip the whites of the four eggs until they are 
very stiff, then gradually stir in the yolks. Use a wire whisk 
and cut through the mixture. Do not stir more than neces- 
sary. Add two gills of flour which has been sifted twice. 
Butter a cylinder mould and dredge it with sugar. Pour in 
the mixture, filling the mould about three-quarters full, allow- 
ing it room to rise. Bake in a moderate oven twenty to twenty- 
five minutes. Turn it out of the mould and set away to cool. 
Whip very stiff one pint of rich cream, sweeten with a table- 
spoon of powdered sugar, and flavor with one tablespoon of 
Madeira. Then fill up the hollow of the pudding with the 
whipped cream, giving it the shape of an individual charlotte. 
Pour the rest of the whipped cream into a bowl, flavor it with 



310 MES. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

strained strawberry juice to color it pink. Put the cream into 
a paper cornucopia and form it into rosettes around the pud- 
ding. Place in ice-box for one hour. Fresh strawberries may 
be passed round with it. 



Charlotte Busse 

Line the bottom of a charlotte mould with white paper and 
the sides with lady's fingers. Boil half a pint of milk with 
one-quarter of a Tanilla bean. Beat the yolks of three eggs 
with three ounces of sugar and add the boiling milk. Stir 
over a moderate fire until it begins to thicken. Do not let it 
boil. Remove the vanilla bean and add one sheet of clear 
gelatine, moistened in a little cold water and dissolved in one- 
half gill of boiling water. Rub the whole mixture through a 
fine strainer, set it away until it is slightly thick, and mix it 
with a pint and a half of whipped cream. Pour into the char- 
lotte mould, cover the top with paper, and set on the ice for an 
hour or more. When ready to serve, invert on a dish. Have 
a cover for the top made of the lady's finger pastry, decorate it 
with icing, and, if desired, candied cherries, etc. 

Charlotte Busse 

Dissolve a fourth of a package, or two teaspoons, of gelatine 
in a fourth of a cup of cold water, and add it to half a pint of 
milk heated and three-quarters of a cup of sugar. Whip half 
a pint of rich cream, add to the gelatine and sugar, and stir in 
later the beaten whites of the eggs. Flavor with vanilla. 

Charlotte a la Parisienne 
Cut horizontally, in half-inch slices, a sponge cake, and 
cover each slice with a different kind of preserve. Pile the 
slices in their original form, and spread over the whole cake a 
stiff icing. One kind of preserve, instead of several, may be 
used for this charlotte, and pound cake instead of sponge cake.

Chocolate Blanc-mange 

Soak one ounce of gelatine for fifteen minutes in one cup of 
cold milk, then add two cups and a half of boiling milk. Mix 
a quarter of a pound of grated chocolate with half a cup of 
cold milk and add it to the gelatine with six tablespoons of 
granulated sugar. Place this in a saucepan over the fire and 
stir constantly until it boils. Remove from the fire, stir in 
one tablespoon of vanilla extract, and when cooled pour into 
the moulds, which have previously been rinsed with cold water 
and sprinkled with granulated sugar. Set in cold place until 
firm. Serve with liquid cream sauce. 

Cornucopias 

One egg will make twelve cornucopias. Mix with it just as 
much powdered sugar and just as much flour as the egg meas- 
ures in a cup. Stir until smooth. Butter some tin sheets. 
Spread the mixture very thin and a spoonful at a time on the 
sheets. Allow sufficient space for them not to touch. When 
baked in a quick oven, they should be the size of a saucer. 
Remove from the sheets and quickly twist them in the shape 
of a cornucopia. Fill each one with whipped cream. One 
must work rapidly, else the cake will harden. 

Caramel Custard with Sauce 

Half a cup of sugar, six eggs, two tablespoons of water, half 
a teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of vanilla, and one quart of milk. 
Put the sugar in a pan over the fire and stir until it melts and 
is a light brown. Add the water and stir into a part of the 
milk, which has been warmed. Beat the eggs, add the salt 
and vanilla, and the rest of the milk; strain into the milk 
which has been combined with the sugar and pour into a 
mould. Set the mould in a pan of warm water and bake 
thirty or forty minutes. To find out if the custard is done, 



312 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

cut in it with a knife. If the knife comes out clean, it is done. 
Serve cold. 

Caramel Sauce 

Put half a cup of sugar into a pan and stir over the fire 
till brown. Add half a cup of boiling water and simmer ten 
minutes. 

Coffee Flummery 

Soak four sheets of gelatine in two scant pints of water over 
night. The next morning set the gelatine over the fire to melt 
and add a cup of coffee, made of the strength of two table- 
spoons of ground coffee. Set away to cool, having sweetened 
to taste. When the jelly begins to set, beat the whites of two 
eggs and a small half cup of sugar and add it to the jelly, 
then beat all until solid and white. Serve cold. 

Croquante of Oranges 

Remove the peel and white skin from six oranges. Then 
divide them by pulling them in small sections, taking care not 
to break the skin which envelops the pulp. Put half a pound 
of the finest lump sugar into a sugar boiler, with just enough 
water to cover it, and boil it down until it becomes brittle. To 
test it, when it begins to boil up in big bubbles, take a little on 
the point of a knife and instantly dip it in cold water. If the 
sugar becomes set, it is sufficiently boiled and will easily snap 
in breaking. Remove from the fire. The pieces of orange, 
stuck on the point of a small wooden skewer", must be slightly 
dipped in the sugar and arranged at the bottom and round the 
sides of a plain circular mould, which has been rubbed lightly 
with olive oil. When the pieces of orange are arranged and 
the sugar has become firm by cooling, just before sending to 
table fill the inside of the croquante with whipped cream, 
sugared and flavored with a glass of maraschino and some 
whole strawberries. Invert on a dish and serve. 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 313 

Fanchonette 

Crush two cups of red raspberries and cook them with one 
cup of granulated sugar until they are thick. Add the juice of 
half a lemon. When thoroughly cooled, stir in four finely 
crushed lady's fingers. Beat this mixture, a spoonful at a time, 
into the stiffly beaten whites of four eggs. Line a mould with 
blanched almonds and fill it with the mixture. Set this mould 
in a pan of boiling water and bake in the oven for twenty-five 
minutes. When cool, invert it on a dish and serve with cus- 
tard sauce. 

Gooseberry Pool 

Cut the ends and stems off large, ripe gooseberries and put 
them in a jar or bowl with a little water and a little moistened 
sugar. Set the jar or bowl in a saucepan of boiling water and 
cook the fruit until it is soft enough to mash. Then rub it 
through a colander, and to every pint of pulp add one pint of 
milk, or milk and cream mixed. Sweeten it to taste. 

Gooseberry Fool 

Top and stalk a quart of green gooseberries and stew them 
with a little water in an earthen dish till they are plump and 
tender. Put them through a fine sieve and sweeten the jam to 
taste and put it in the dish in which you wish to serve it. 
Whip a quart of thick cream till it is stiff, stir in a wine-glass 
of brandy and, if you wish, a little nutmeg. Heap the cream 
upon the jam and serve cold. 

Another Kind of Fool 

Another kind of fool may be made by taking a quart of 
strawberries and raspberries, a pint of each, mashing them, 
straining them, sweetening them, not cooking the pulp, but 
beating it with cream, after the manner of strawberry fool. In 
this the brandy may be omitted,

Apple Jelly 

Take a pound of granulated sugar, put it in a porcelain 
kettle with a pint of cold water, and let it boil till it is a rich 
syrup. Into this syrup drop as many quarters of apples as the 
sugar will absorb, adding also the juice of two lemons. Boil 
until the whole is quite thick, pour into a mould, and set on 
the ice. Serve piled high and set about with whipped cream. 

Jelly a la Macedoine 

Dissolve an ounce and a half of gelatine in one quart of 
water, add three-quarters of a pound of granulated sugar, and 
the juice of two lemons. Mix in a saucepan with the whites of 
two eggs which have been well beaten. Stir over a slow fire 
until the mixture comes to a boil. As soon as it boils, add a 
few drops of cold water, skim off the froth, and strain through 
a wet cloth. When partially cool, add one pint of Sherry. 
Pack a round jelly mould in a pail of broken ice. Pour in 
a little jelly, and when that has set add a layer of preserved 
fruit, such as peaches, apricots, plums, etc. Then cover with 
more jelly. Continue until the mould is full, taking care to 
have each layer of jelly set, and alternating with different 
kinds of fruit. When all is well set, — it takes about two 
hours, — dip the mould in tepid water and invert on a dish. 
The preserved fruits should be well dried before putting into 
the jelly, as moisture would prevent the jelly from congealing. 
Fresh fruit may be used. 

Coffee Jelly 

Make one pint and a half of strong coffee, sweeten to taste, 
dissolve one-quarter of a pound of sheet gelatine in water, 
strain it, and mix with the coffee liquid. This jelly need not 
be cleared. Pour into a mould or moulds and when cold and 
firm serve with whipped cream. 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 315 

Lemon Jelly 

When lemon jelly is desired, make the same as in the first 
wine jelly receipt given below, but omit the wine flavoring, 
and substitute the grated rind of two lemons before cooking 
the liquid. After it is strained, add the strained juice of five 
lemons. 

Whipped Lemon Jelly- 
Mix one quart of water with half a pound of granulated 
sugar, the grated rind of four lemons, the juice of six large 
lemons, and one ounce and a half of gelatine, previously dis- 
solved and strained. Stir over the fire until the sugar and 
gelatine are thoroughly melted and the liquid is lukewarm. 
Strain through a fine sieve. When the jelly begins to congeal, 
beat it with a wire whisk until it is frothy, then pour it into a 
mould and pack it in cracked ice. Serve very cold. 

Orange Jelly- 
Dissolve one ounce and a half of gelatine in a scant half 
pint of boiling water, then strain. Mix three teacups of 
orange juice with one teacup of lemon juice, strain, and add to 
the gelatine. Sweeten to taste with loaf sugar and boil five or 
ten minutes. Beat the whites of two eggs with the eggshells, 
stir in the mixture, and strain through a jelly bag. Rinse a 
mould with cold water, pour the jelly into it, and set in cold 
place till it becomes cold. 

Wine Jelly 

Mix one box of Cox's gelatine with one pint of cold water 
and let it stand ten minutes, then pour in one quart of boiling 
water and stir until all is dissolved. Into a separate vessel put 
one pint of Sherry, one lemon, the rind cut up as for lemonade, 
the white and shell of one egg, a little nutmeg, and about half 
a dozen cloves. When the gelatine is cold, add this mixture to 



316 MBS. seely's cook book 

it. Boil it five minutes without stirring. Remove from the 
fire and let it stand five minutes to settle, then strain through 
a flannel bag, pour it into moulds, and set in a cool place. 

Wine Jelly- 
Soak half a pound of gelatine in enough water to dissolve it. 
Add to it two pounds of granulated sugar, the juice of three 
lemons, the whites of two eggs, and two quarts of water. Stir 
constantly over a clear fire until it is nearly boiling. Place at 
the side of range, and when nearly cold strain it through a wet 
cloth. Flavor to taste with Madeira or any wine you desire. 
Pour into a mould previously dipped in cold water, and when 
cold and firm invert on a dish. 

Wine Jelly- 
Four pints and three-quarters of water, one pint and one- 
quarter of Sherry, three sliced lemons, two ounces of gelatine 
soaked in the water, three and a half cups of sugar, the whites 
and shells of three eggs. Stir all together and boil ten minutes 
without stirring. If this receipt is too sweet, lessen to three 
cups of sugar and taste. Set a colander over a crock or pan, 
lay a wet piece of cheese-cloth over it, pour the jelly in and let 
it drip through ; never squeeze it. Wet a dish with cold water 
and pour in the jelly when cool, and set it on ice till it hardens. 
For serving, take out the jelly with a tablespoon and slightly 
break it and pile in the dish. 

Lady Washington Pudding 

Sift four ounces of flour into a bowl, make a hollow in the 
centre, and put in the yolks of two eggs, three ounces of butter, 
the finely grated peel of half a lemon, and one tablespoon of

paste with the whites of two eggs. Add to the other mixture 
and work it with a wire whisk for five minutes, Place it on a

pastry board and work it for a few minutes. Form it in an 
oblong ball and place it on the ice for one hour. Then roll out 
the paste till it is one-fourth of an inch thick and cut it into a 
round piece — as large a piece as you wish. Lay it on buttered 
paper on a baking sheet. Brush over with beaten egg and 
bake in a medium hot oven till it is a fine golden brown. 
When it is cold, put one quart of strawberries in the centre. 
Sprinkle four tablespoons of powdered sugar over them. Whip 
one pint of cream and color it with strained strawberry juice. 
Whip another pint. Put a part of each in separate cornuco- 
pias and make a border of fancy rosettes, first one of white, 
then one of pink round the edge. Put the rest of the cream, 
which has been sweetened with three tablespoons of sugar and 
flavored to taste with vanilla, in fancy shapes all over the straw- 
berries, making even waves as you go along. By using these 
waves the cake can be cut evenly and neatly. It is a good 
plan to cut the cake before decorating, as the effect is spoiled 
if the cake is cut way through after the decoration is put on. 
Place some small meringue shells filled with pink cream round 
the edge of the dish. 

Lemon Fromage 
Dissolve one cup of granulated sugar in one pint of water. 
Add the peel of one lemon and the juice of three lemons. Boil 
five minutes ; add one ounce of gelatine which has been soaked 
in half a pint of water. Stir all together until the gelatine is 
dissolved, then strain. When the liquid is cold and begins to 
thicken, stir in a pint of whipped cream, pour into a form, and 
place on ice for two hours or more. 

Matrimony 

Pare and cut in small pieces two dozen peaches, cover them 
thickly with sugar, and let them stand three or four hours. 
Beat them in a quart of sweetened cream and freeze.

Melrose Pudding 

The whites of six eggs, one cup of powdered sugar, three- 
fourths of a cup of flour, half a teaspoon of cream of tartar. Beat 
the whites very stiff, lightly stir in the sugar which has been 
sifted, then add the cream of tartar dissolved in a little warm 
water. Stir in the flour, which has been sifted twice, and one 
teaspoon of vanilla. Dip a fancy shaped cake pan in cold 
water, dredge it with sugar, and pour in the cake mixture. 
Bake in a slow oven thirty minutes. Make the following fill- 
ing : Cut very fine three marrons, three candied plums, ten 
candied cherries, and one slice of candied pineapple. Soak 
them in maraschino for one hour. Whip half a pint of cream 
very stiff and stir in the candied fruit. Put in a cool place or 
on ice for one hour. Take your cake, and with a fancy cutter 
or a pastry wheel cut out the top. Scoop out the inside. At 
the bottom put some marmalade or strawberries that have been 
crushed and sweetened. Then pour in your cream mixture, 
replace the top of the cake, and cover with some of the whipped 
cream colored with strained strawberry juice. Pour the cream 
through a paper cornucopia and give it fanciful shapes. Spin 
a little sugar and put round the dish. 

Nesselrode Pudding 

Boil three dozen French chestnuts, and when they are done 
peel, pound in a mortar, and rub them through a sieve. Put 
this pulp in a stewpan with the yolks of eight eggs, one pint 
of cream, one pint of pineapple syrup, a little bit of salt, and 
vanilla to taste. Stir the mixture constantly over the fire 
until the eggs are sufficiently set, then strain it through a wet 
cloth. Cut in small pieces four ounces of citron, six ounces of 
pineapple — cooked in the syrup above alluded to — six ounces 
of candied cherries, and four ounces of raisins. Soak them 
three or four hours in two ounces of maraschino. Freeze in 



COLD PUDDINGS, CBEAMS, MEBINGUES, AND ICES 319 

the usual manner. "When about half frozen, add half a pint of 
whipped cream and the fruit. When the pudding is thor- 
oughly frozen, pack it in a mould and keep it covered with 
cracked ice until served. 

Meringues 

Have at hand one pound of sifted powdered sugar and the 
whites of twelve eggs. Beat the whites with a wire whisk 
until they become a perfectly smooth, substantial froth. Then 
with a spoon lightly mix in the sugar. Do not work the mixture 
any more than is necessary, else it will become soft and the 
meringues will be difficult to mould. The firmer the mixture, 
the better shape the meringues will be. Cut some heavy white 
paper in strips about two inches wide. Then take a tablespoon 
and gather it nearly full of the mixture by working it up at the 
side of the bowl in the form of an egg. Drop this slopingly on 
one of the strips of paper, at the same time drawing the edge 
of the spoon round the outer base of the meringue, so as to give 
it a smooth and round appearance — make it resemble an egg as 
near as possible. Place each meringue at least two inches and 
a half apart. As each band is filled, place it close beside the 
others on the table. When all the mixture is used, shake some 
rather coarse sifted sugar over the meringues and let them 
stand three minutes. Take hold of one of the bands at each 
end, shake off the loose sugar, and place the band on a board. 
Treat each band the same way. Place the board, or boards, 
side by side in a very moderate oven and bake slowly until the 
meringues are a light fawn color. This will probably take 
fifty minutes. When done, carefully remove each meringue 
from the paper; with a desert-spoon scoop out the white part 
inside, keeping them nicely smooth. Arrange them on a tin 
baking sheet and put them in the oven to dry. Great care 
must be taken not to brown them any more. Just before serv- 
ing, whip some cream very stiff, flavor it with sifted powdered 



320 MRS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

sugar and vanilla, or any kind of liquor. Put a spoonful in 
each meringue, join two together, and arrange on a napkin in 
the form of a pyramid. Instead of the whipped cream you 
may use any kind of preserve or ice-cream. The board men- 
tioned above should be of well-seasoned wood and about one 
inch thick, its size proportioned to your oven. You must have 
ample room for turning the boards about. 

Apple Meringues 

Peel and core six nice greening apples and make a good-sized 
space in the middle of each apple. In a saucepan put two cups 
of water, one cup of granulated sugar, two whole cloves, and a 
little dash of nutmeg. When this comes to a boil, put in the 
apples and cook them till they are tender. Test them with a 
broom whisk. When one side is done, turn the apples and 
have care not to break them. When they are cooked, take 
them out of the syrup and set them away to cool. Strain the 
syrup and save it for further use. Into a bowl sift half a 
pound of granulated sugar. Beat the whites of two eggs to 
a very stiff froth and add the sugar by degrees, cutting the 
whites down and folding them over. When the granulated 
sugar is mixed in, add four tablespoons of powdered sugar. 
Put your apples in a baking dish, fill the centres with straw- 
berries which have been sprinkled with powdered sugar. When 
the apples are filled with the strawberries, cover each one with 
meringue. Put them in a slow oven for thirty minutes or more 
to color them a light brown. Do not take them out till they 
are thoroughly dry. Should the oven be too hot, the meringue 
will spoil. Take them from the oven, and when thoroughly 
cold with a long-bladed knife turn the shells apple side up. 
Whip a pint of rich cream, put it in a pastry bag, and form a 
rosette on each apple. Mount a strawberry on top and serve 
on fancy papers. The syrup the apples were cooked in may be 
used for bread pudding, sauces, baked apples, or deep apple pie.

Boiled Meringue Shells 

Boil half a pound of granulated sugar and a quarter of a 
pint of water for ten minutes until they form a large ball. 
You test the sugar by dipping a spoon in cold water and then 
taking a little of the boiled sugar and dropping it into a bowl 
of cold water. Then by taking the sugar between your fingers 
if you find it forms a ball, it has cooked to the right degree. 
Add the well-beaten whites of three eggs to the hot sugar, and 
stir constantly till it begins to cool. Then set it on the ice for 
ten minutes. Have a board well oiled with olive oil. Put a 
sheet of white paper over it. On this drop the sugar in spoon- 
fuls, either large or small as you wish. Put them one inch 
apart, so they will not adhere to each other. Bake in a slow 
oven until they are a delicate brown. Fill with cream, and 
serve as above. 

Lemon Meringue 

Dissolve two cups of stale bread crumbs in one quart of 
milk, add one cup of sugar, the beaten yolks of four eggs, and 
the grated rind of one lemon. Beat all together until very 
light, then pour in a buttered baking dish and bake in a mod- 
erate oven for half an hour, or until firm. Beat the whites of 
the four eggs with four tablespoons of powdered sugar and the 
juice of one lemon to a stiff froth and spread over the pudding. 
Place in a quick oven and bake to a light brown. This pud- 
ding may be served cold or hot. 

Strawberry Meringue 

The whites of seven eggs, seven tablespoons of powdered 
sugar, a quarter of a teaspoon of salt, and half a cup of pre- 
served strawberries. Beat the eggs to a stiff froth, then with 
a spoon gradually beat the powdered sugar and salt into the 
froth. Butter a two-quart pudding dish and line the bottom 
with meringue. Drop in the preserves by the half spoonful, 



322 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

alternating the fruit and froth until all is used. Bake in a 
moderate oven twenty-five minutes. Serve very cold with 
whipped cream. 

Porto Rico Witches 

Cut in thin slices, pound, sponge, or other cake, and spread 
half of each slice with guava jelly, or with strawberry, raspberry, 
or currant jelly if wished. On the jelly strew thickly fresh 
grated cocoanut. Press over it the other half of the slice and 
trim the whole to a good form. Pile the slices in mountain 
form upon a dish covered with a white napkin and garnish with 
sprigs of myrtle or other tropical green. 

Pudding a la Prancaise 

Six ounces of crumbs, four ounces of flour, six ounces of beef 
marrow, six ounces of chopped apples, two ounces of mixed 
chopped peel, four ounces of apricot jam, two ounces of raspberry 
jam, five eggs, and half a pint of milk. Mix well, boil for three 
hours, and serve with liquid brandy sauce. 

Creamed Rice ~- 

Boil one cup of rice in a little milk until it is well cooked. 
Use a double boiler. "While the rice is hot, stir in a quarter of 
a box of gelatine, already dissolved in milk, and sweeten to taste. 
When cold, mix in one pint of whipped cream and vanilla too 
taste. Dip a melon mould in cold water, drain, and fill it with 
the rice mixture. Set on ice five or six hours. 

Rice Timbale 

Line a timbale mould with puff paste and set on the ice to 
cool. Cook two ounces of rice in one cup of milk until per- 
fectly smooth, add the yolks of two eggs, and four tablespoons 
of granulated sugar. Mix thoroughly and strain through a 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 323 

puree sieve. Stir in the well -beaten whites of the two eggs, and 
when cool, line the mould, which has already been lined with 
paste, with rice. Set in a cool place. Peel and quarter and 
remove the cores of two nice apples, place in a saucepan with 
two gills of water and four tablespoons of powdered sugar. 
Boil until the apples are tender and stir in six or seven pre- 
served apricots, six spoons of marmalade, and a little Sherry. 
When this mixture is cold, place in the centre of the mould. 
Spread more rice on top and cover all with puff paste cut to fit 
the top. Place in an ice-box for half an hour, then place the 
mould in the oven and bake for thirty minutes, or until the 
paste is a nice brown. Chill it thoroughly, turn it on a dish, 
and serve with whipped cream. 

Iced Rice Pudding a la Cerito 

Wash and parboil a quarter of a pound of rice. Drain it, 
and put it in a saucepan with one pint of milk, half a pint of 
cream, six ounces of granulated sugar, a little salt and vanilla 
to taste. Boil over a slow fire until the grains are almost dis- 
solved, stirring it lightly at times while it is cooking. When 
done, add the yolks of three eggs and stir thoroughly to mix in 
the eggs and to break up and smooth the rice. Pack the mix- 
ture in a fancy mould with a hollow centre and freeze. Pre- 
pare oranges in the following way: Remove the rind and white 
pith, cut the fruit in half, remove the core and seeds, leaving 
only the transparent pulp. Place them in a saucepan with half 
a pint of syrup made as follows: Cook half a pound of granu- 
lated sugar and a scant half pint of water till you have a smooth 
syrup. In this boil the oranges three minutes, then drain them 
on a sieve. Boil the syrup down to half its quantity, stir in two 
wine-glasses of curacoa, and three tablespoons of apricot jam. 
Mix thoroughly and pour over the oranges. Invert the mould 
on a plate, fill with the oranges and syrup, and serve.

Snow Eggs 
Have at hand four eggs, three gills of milk, sugar to taste, 
and flavoring of lemon rind or vanilla. Put the milk in a sauce- 
pan with enough sugar to sweeten it and add the rind of half 
a lemon. Let this steep slowly at the side of the range for half 
an hour. Then remove the peel. Separate the yolks from the 
whites of the eggs and whisk the whites to a perfectly stiff 
froth, or until there is no liquid remaining. Bring the milk to 
a boiling point, drop the snow, — a tablespoon at a time, — and 
keep turning them until sufficiently cooked. Then place them 
in a glass dish. Beat up the yolks of the eggs, add them to the 
milk. Mix thoroughly and then strain through a wet cloth. 
Put into a bowl, and set the bowl in a saucepan of boiling water. 
Stir it one way until the mixture thickens. Do not allow it 
to boil, else it will curdle. Pour this custard over the eggs. 
They should rise to the surface. Set in a cool place until served. 

Snow Pudding 

Soak two teaspoons of gelatine in a little cold water, add one 
pint of hot water in which one cup of sugar has been dissolved, 
and the juice of two lemons. Beat the whites of two eggs, add 
and beat the whole mixture half an hour, or until it sets. 

Savarin a la Creme 

One-half cup of butter, one cup of granulated sugar, half a 
cup of milk, three eggs, one large cup of flour, and one tea- 
spoon of baking powder. Flavor with a little rum. Cream the 
butter and sugar, then the well-beaten yolks of the eggs, mix 
thoroughly and stir in the milk. Sift the flour and baking 
powder together and add to the mixture. Lastly, add the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs and the rum flavoring. Bake 
in a round buttered pan in a moderate oven forty minutes. 
This mixture will make two medium-sized cakes. When baked 
and thoroughly cool, cut out the top crust, remove the inside of 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 325 

the cake, and fill with fresh fruit of all kinds cut into small 
pieces, and mixed thoroughly with half a cup of maraschino. 
Decorate with whipped cream and some of the fresh fruit. 

Waffle Charlotte a la Tortoni with Glaze 
Make a batter of the following: Sift two cups of flour with 
one heaping teaspoon of baking powder and rub into it two 
tablespoons of butter. When well mixed, add one cup of milk, 
half a teaspoon of salt, three eggs, one after the other, stirring 
in one thoroughly before the next is added. Have your waffle 
iron hot and well greased, pour your mixture into a pitcher, and 
pour on the waffle iron. Turn every minute or two until both 
sides are a delicate brown. When all are baked, set aside for 
future use. Make the following preparation: Put in a double 
boiler the yolks of six eggs, two tablespoons of granulated sugar, 
three tablespoons of maraschino, and two tablespoons of Madeira. 
Put over the fire and stir five minutes, or until it begins to 
thicken. Then set it away in ice water to cool. When cold, 
thoroughly mix it with a pint of whipped cream, two tablespoons 
of powdered sugar, and one teaspoon of vanilla. Set in a cool 
place until wanted. Make a glaze of sugar and dip each side 
of the waffle in it. Lay one waffle in the bottom of the dish 
you are to serve it in and make a circle all round the dish. 
When firm on the dish, fill in with the Tortoni mixture. Set 
away to cool. Take a glass of red currant jelly, cook for 
twenty minutes, or until it will thread when pulled. Pull while 
it is hot into wicker and work round the waffles three rows 
deep, one at the bottom, one in the middle, and one on the edge, 
giving the appearance of a basket. 

To make Glaze to join Waffles 
Place one cup of granulated sugar over the fire with three 
teaspoons of water. Cook ten minutes. Dip in edges of the 
waffles and join while hot.

Having washed and thoroughly chilled fine cantaloupes, cut 
them in halves and remove carefully all seeds and stringy part 
clinging to the seeds. Pack the halves with ice-cream, garnish 
with cold peaches cut in quarters, eighths, circles, or any shape 
your fancy directs, and serve at once. Other fruit may be used 
instead of peaches, the seasons and the interchange of markets 
sometimes permitting strawberries.

water. Mix the juice of ten oranges with one pint of sugar and 
one quart of cold water. Add the gelatine and freeze. 

Frozen Oranges 
In eight even-sized smooth oranges cut an inch wide round 
hole on the stem side. Take out the pulp with the small end 
of a teaspoon. Soak the skins in cold water, drain, and scrape 
the inside smoothly without injuring the peel. Cut candied 
fruits such as citron, angelica, raisins, orange peel, etc., in small 
pieces and soak in maraschino. Mix these with enough orange 
ice to fill the oranges. Fill each orange. Cover with the

Baked Pears 

Wipe some large, sound, iron pears and arrange them in a 
porcelain baking dish with the stalk ends upward. Pour a little 
water over them and enough good molasses to sweeten them 
thoroughly. Bake in slow oven several hours. If baked 
slowly, they will be juicy, sweet, and tender in flesh and skin. 
They gain in flavor if they are basted now and then with the 
molasses and water in which they cook. If the oven is hot, put 
a cover over the dish while they are baking. 

Creamed Pineapple 

Chop, or better grate, a fine fresh pineapple and add to it 
the juice of a lemon. Take half a box of gelatine which you 
have thoroughly dissolved in a cup of cold water — if necessary 
by setting the cup in a dish of hot water for a time — and pour 
over the pineapple. Stir it well and set it on ice till a trifle 
stiff. Then add the beaten whites of four eggs. Mould and 
serve with whipped cream sweetened and flavored to taste. 
Instead of the pineapple, strawberries may be used, or peaches, 
or red raspberries. If you use the berries, crush them, while 
the peaches may be cut small with a silver knife. Chill 
thoroughly and serve. 

Pineapple Syllabub 

Beat the whites of three eggs stiff, and to them add gradu- 
ally three tablespoons of powdered sugar and a couple of tea- 
spoons of Sherry, or, if you prefer, a teaspoon of Sherry and one

Strawberry Ice 

Dissolve two sheets of gelatine, moistening with a little cold 
water and adding a scant pint of boiling water. Add a quart 
and a half of cold water, four cups of sugar, the juice of three 
lemons, and two boxes of fine ripe berries, well crushed. This 
quantity will make a three-quart freezer full. 

Strawberry Ice 

Put one quart of fresh strawberries in a bowl and over them 
sprinkle two cups of powdered sugar. Let them stand two 
hours, press them through a fine sieve, add the juice of two 
lemons, a pint of water, and strain and freeze.

Cut up in fine pieces a slice of candied pineapple, some candied 
cherries, pistachio nuts, some candied plums, — pink, green, and 
white, — and a few raisins. In all have four ounces. Cover 
them with maraschino or Sherry, according to taste. Let them 
stand two hours. In a saucepan put one cup of granulated 



334 .MRS. beely's cook book 

sugar and half a cup of cold water and cook steadily over a slow 
fire ten minutes. Test it by dropping a little of the syrup in 
cold water. When you can form it ioto a soft ball, the syrup 
has reached the right degree. Have the whites of three eggs 
beaten so you can cut them with a knife. Pour the hot syrup 
slowly into the whites, stirring constantly. Place the bowl in 
cold water and stir the mixture until it is cold. Whip a pint 
of cream until it is stiff and flavor with one tablespoon of 
vanilla. Drain your candied fruits and stir them into the 
whipped cream. Put this mixture in the mould you have lined 
with strawberry ice. Put some more strawberry ice on top. 
Cover it securely and pack closely in rock salt and ice. Let 
it stand four hours. When wanted, dip your mould in tepid 
water, remove the cover, and turn your cream on a dish. Put 
a garland of candied fruit around the edge. 

Strawberry Punch 
Hull a quart of fine fresh strawberries, cover them with three 
cups of sugar, and set them away till the sugar has drawn out 
their juice, and they stand in a red syrup. Then put the syrup 
and berries through a fine sieve and add a claret glass of sweet 
wine and a cup and a half of water. Stir well together and 
freeze. Serve in punch or lemonade glasses.

rich raisins. When the mixture is nearly frozen, add these 
fruits, turn the freezer a few minutes longer, then let it stand 
until wanted. When ready to serve, have at hand a large flat 
dish of shredded cocoanut. Take a spoonful of the cream at a 
time, mould it into the shape of an egg, then roll it in the 
shredded cocoanut. Spin some sugar, form into a nest, and 
place your eggs in it. This cream may be made with plain 
marrons or chestnuts in place of the candied fruits. 

Vanilla Ice-cream 

To one pint of whipped cream add one pint of milk and a 
tablespoon of vanilla. Sweeten to taste, taking care not to put 
in too much sugar. Freeze so that it will be perfectly smooth. 

Walnut and Fig Ice-cream 

Heat two and a half cups of milk, having reserved cold half 
a cup to mix with the other ingredients. A part of this half 
cup of cold milk use for dissolving a tablespoon of gelatine, and

CAKES, FILLINGS, AND ICINGS 

Icing for Cakes 
One pound of sugar in half pint of hot water. Let it boil 
ten minutes, or until it becomes a small ball. Remove at once, 
pour it on to a well-oiled marble slab. When nearly cold, work 
it with a wooden spoon until it becomes white, then work with 
the hands until it is a creamy substance. Place in double boiler 
and stir over the fire until it is dissolved. Color any sbade 
required. Pour over the cake while it is liquid and hot. 

Clear Icing 
Sift in a bowl half a pound of powdered sugar, add the whites 
of two eggs. Stir a few minutes, then add the juice of half a 
lemon. Stir until perfectly clear and smooth. 

Royal Icing 
Place the white of an egg in a bowl, add a little lemon juice 
or any other flavoring, and a few drops of water. Stir in the 
powdered sugar until it becomes of the right consistency to 
spread upon warm cake. Pile in the centre of the cake and 
with a wet knife smooth over the top and sides of the cake. It 
will settle into a smooth and glossy surface. 

How to use a Pastry Bag 
Hold the top of the pastry bag in the right hand and with 
the thumb and first finger of the left hand hold the funnel or 
end. Press with the right hand and guide with the left. Hold

Almond Cake 

Take one pound of powdered sugar, one quart of flour, sifted 
twice with two rounded teaspoonfuls of Cleveland's baking 
powder, one-quarter of a pound of butter, seven eggs, whites 
and yolks beaten separately, one large cupful of almonds, 
blanched, pounded, and flavored with one teaspoonful of rose 
water, and one-half teaspoonful of the essence of bitter 
almonds. Cream the butter and sugar, beat the whipped 
whites into the mixture, alternately adding the almond paste. 
Beat for two minutes, then add the yolks, and lastly the sifted 
flour and baking powder. Bake in a hot oven. 

To blanch Almonds 

Pour boiling water upon them, and slip off the skins. Set 
them in the sun or an open oven to dry and crisp before they 
are pounded in a mortar. Add the essence while they are 
being pounded. Flavor the icing with rose water and a little 
essence of bitter almonds. 

Almond Cakes 

Have at hand three ounces of flour, four ounces of granu- 
lated sugar, one ounce of ground or finely pounded almonds, 
the yolks of three eggs, the whipped whites of two and one 
whole egg, half a small glass of good brandy, a little salt, two 
ounces of chopped almonds mixed with one ounce of powdered 
sugar, and quarter of the white of an egg. Cream the butter 
with a wooden spoon, then gradually add the flour, sugar, 
ground almonds, — a few bitter ones may be pounded with them 
if desired, — brandy, eggs, and salt. Then lightly stir in the 
whipped whites. Pour into a buttered pan. Have the dough 
one inch thick. Bake until a light brown. When nearly done, 
spread the prepared chopped almonds over the top, then put 
the cake back again in the oven to finish baking. When done, 



338 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

the almonds should be a light fawn color. Carefully turn the 
cake out of the pan. When cold, cut it in bands about one 
inch or inch and a half wide. Out the bands into diamond- 
shaped cakes. Place some whipped cream in the centre of a 
dish and arrange the cakes around it. Currants or sultana 
raisins may be added to the above cake, and it may be flavored 
with any essence or liqueur in place of the brandy. 

Angel Cake 

The whites of eleven eggs beaten to a stiff froth, one tum- 
bler of white sugar, one tumbler of flour, sifted four times, the 
last time sifted into the mixture, an even teaspoon of cream 
of tartar, vanilla flavoring. To the whites add the sugar, next 
the flavoring, then sift in the flour with the cream of tartar in 
it. Do not butter the tin. Put in a round pan with a tin roll 
in the centre and without paper in the bottom. Bake in a 
moderate oven till a straw comes out clear, which will be in 
twenty or twenty-five minutes. It should be very light-col- 
ored and delicate. 

Angel Cake 

The whites of nine fresh eggs, one cup and a quarter of 
sifted, granulated sugar, one cup of sifted flour, half teaspoon- 
ful of cream of tartar, a pinch of salt, added to the eggs before 
beating. After sifting the flour four or five times, measure 
and put aside one cup, then sift and measure one cup and a 
quarter of granulated sugar. Beat the whites of the eggs 
about half, add the cream of tartar, and beat until very stiff. 
Stir in the sugar, then the flour very lightly. Put in a pan in 
a moderate oven at once. The cake will bake in thirty-five to 
fifty minutes. 

Angel Cake

teaspoonful of vanilla. Beat the whites of the eggs to a very- 
stiff froth, then gradually stir in the sugar, which has been 
sifted, and add vanilla to eggs and sugar. Stir the cream of 
tartar and flour together and sift three times and add to the 
above mixture. Bake in moderate oven forty minutes. 



Betsy 

Cream one pound of butter and one pound and a quarter of 
sugar. Add four eggs, two and a half pounds of flour, two 
teaspoons of ginger, to your taste of caraway seeds, and half a 
teaspoon of saleratus. Roll very thin, cut in long strips, and 
bake a delicate brown. 



Birthday Cake with Glaze 

One cup of butter, two cups of sugar, five eggs, three cups 
of flour, one heaping teaspoonful of baking powder, one cup 
of milk, one teaspoonful of rose water. Sift the sugar, then 
measure it. Wash the butter once in ice water until it is white 
and creamy, dry it in a towel and add it to the sugar. Rub 
both to a creamy substance and stir in the yolks of the eggs, 
one by one. Beat all until light and foamy. Stir in one cup of 
sifted flour, then add the milk, then another cup of sifted flour. 
Mix well and stir in the last cup of flour which has the baking 
powder sifted with it. When well mixed, add the well-beaten 
whites and the rose water. Butter a large round cake tin and 
line the bottom with paper. Pour in your mixture and bake 
in moderate oven for one hour. When you remove it from the 
oven, be sure it is thoroughly cooked. Test it by putting a fine 
broom whisk through the centre of the cake. If the whisk 
comes out dry, the cake is done. Stand the pan on a wire 
sieve until the cake is partially cool. Make a glaze for the 
top of the cake as follows : — 



340 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

To make Glaze for Birthday Cake 
In a saucepan put one cup of granulated sugar with four 
tablespoonfuls of water. Boil ten minutes slowly, or until it 
reaches a large ball. Have the white of one egg whipped very 
stiff, and slowly pour the hot sugar into it, stirring constantly. 
While hot, pour it slowly and thinly over the cake. Do not 
use a knife, as it will make the surface rough. Let it dry, 
which will be almost immediately. Make the following icing 
for decorating : — 

To make Icing for Birthday Cake 
Half a pound of powdered sugar, whites of two eggs, juice 
of one lemon. Beat the eggs for two minutes until stiff and 
by degrees add the sifted sugar, stirring all the time with a wire 
egg-beater. When all the sugar is used, beat well for five min- 
utes with a Dover egg beater, so the icing will be thoroughly 
smooth. Put a fancy tube in a pastry bag and fill the bag with 
the icing. Make a paper funnel with a very small opening and 
fill also with icing. With the paper funnel trace any design 
you desire on the cake, commencing at the extreme edge. 
Leave space in the centre for the initials or date. Follow up 
the paper funnel with the pastry bag and with this fill out the 
design. You must work rapidly, so the tracing of icing will 
not harden before the decoration is filled in. Color the 
remainder of the icing pink and put, on the initials or date. 
Have some pink and white candied rose leaves, dip them in 
sugar syrup to make them stick, and put them round the lower 
edge of your cake. Before you begin to decorate the cake, 
place it on a round board, a little larger than the cake, and cov- 
ered with a fancy edged paper. 

How to write the Initials on Birthday Cake 
Reserve about one-quarter of your icing, stir in a drop of 
cochineal to color it pink. Make a three-cornered paper funnel,

fuls of Royal baking powder. Bake in cake tins lined with 
buttered paper. Mix half a pint of apricot jam with a little 
maraschino or Sherry and rub well till smooth. Lay the cakes 
together before quite cold with the mixture between. Ice over 
with royal or water icing and decorate.

Layer Cake 

Cream one pound of butter with one pound and a half of 
powdered sugar. Add the yolks of three eggs and stir for half 
an hour, then add one-quarter of a pound of grated almonds, 
— remove the skins before grating, — two scant cups of flour, 
and the well-beaten whites of two eggs. Bake in four buttered 
tins, round or square, and spread each layer with any filling 
that is desired. 

Chicago Loaf 

Cream one pound of sugar and half a pound of butter. Add 
eight eggs beaten stiff, one pound of flour, one pound of raisins, 
a glass of wine, and the grated rind and half the juice of a fine 
lemon. 

Macaroons 

Pour boiling water over half a pound of almonds, remove, 
the skins, and plunge them into cold water. Drain thoroughly 
and put in the oven. When dry, pound them in a mortar until 
they become a paste, gradually adding the white of one egg. 
Then add one pound and a half of powdered sugar. Again 
pound thoroughly, gradually adding the whites of two eggs. 
Spread a piece of white paper on a tin sheet, form your mixture 
in little rounds, a little smaller than a twenty -five cent piece. 
Place them on the paper about one inch and a half apart. Bake 
them in a slow oven for about twelve minutes, at the end of 
that time they should be well colored. Remove from the oven. 
When they become cold, turn the papers over and moisten with 
a little water, the macaroons can then be easily removed. 

Maple Sugar Cake with Filling 

Cream one cup of granulated sugar with a lump of butter 
the size of an egg, stir in the yolks of two eggs and the white 
of one, and then add two small cups of flour with two teaspoon-

Spread the following filling between each layer : — 

Filling for Maple Sugar Cake 

Boil one cup of maple syrup until it hairs off the spoon. 
Then add the well-beaten white of one egg. Stir until smooth. 

Maple Sugar Cookies 

Take one cup of butter, one cup of sour milk, three cups 
of shaved maple sugar, two eggs, and one teaspoonful of soda. 
Make the dough stiff enough with flour to drop off a spoon. 
Roll out, and bake in quick oven. 

Green Mountain Boys 

Two pounds of flour, half a pound of butter, half a pound 
of brown sugar, a pound and a half of maple syrup, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt. These cakes should be dropped on greased 
paper and baked. The thickness of the dough depends upon 
the thickness of the syrup ; if it is thin, add flour ; if too thick, 
add maple syrup till of the right consistency. 

Soft Molasses Cake 

Three cups of molasses, one cup of butter, two cups of boil- 
ing water, one teaspoonful of baking soda dissolved in a little 
water, three teaspoonfuls of ground ginger, and five cups of 
sifted flour. Mix thoroughly, and bake in a hot oven.

of oatmeal, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Let the 
dough get cold, then roll very thin and bake in a hot oven. 

Plum Oake 
Six eggs, half a pound of butter, half a pound of powdered 
sugar, twelve ounces of flour, one wine-glass of cognac, a quar- 
ter of an ounce of ground allspice, the finely chopped rind of a 
lemon, two pounds of mixed fruits, such as sultana raisins, cur- 
rants, sliced citron, and orange peel. Stir the butter to a cream 
in a warm earthen bowl, using a wooden spoon. Add the 
sugar and stir for ten minutes, and then, one by one, stir in the 
six egg yolks. Stir again for five minutes and then add half 
of the flour. When this is mixed, put in the fruits and brandy 
and mix again. Beat the egg whites to a hard froth, add to the 
mixture, and stir all thoroughly with the rest of the flour and 
a little salt. Line a buttered mould with a well-buttered paper, 
pour in the mixture, and cook in a moderate oven for one hour 
and a half. Cool, peel off the paper, and ornament with white 
sugar icing. 

Pound Cake 

One pound of sifted flour, one pound of granulated sugar, 
one pound of eggs, a scant pound of butter, a tablespoonful of 
brandy, and one-half teaspoonf ul of mace. Cream the sugar and 
butter and beat the yolks and whites of the eggs separately. 
Just before mixing, whip the brandy and spice into the sugar 
and butter. Then stir in the yolks and beat hard for two min- 
utes. Add the whites of the eggs and flour alternately, whip- 
ping with long side strokes lightly and quickly. The heavy 
work is done before these go in. Do not stir the batter after 
these are added. A pound-cake batter should be stiffer than 
that of a cup or a sponge cake. Bake in small greased tins, or 
in square, flat pans, in a steady oven. Test the oven with a bit 
of letter paper before putting the cake into it. If in five min- 
utes the paper is a light yellow, the oven is all right.

Princess Cakes 

First make a paste as follows : Place half a pound of flour 
on a board, make a hollow in the centre, and put in it half a tea- 
spoonful of salt with a little water to melt it, and add the yolks 
of four eggs. Work the whole well together, at first rubbing 
the ingredients between the hands. Finish working the paste 
by pushing it from you with the palms of the hands. Sprinkle 
with a few drops of water and knead it into a ball. This paste 
must be very stiff. Roll it out very thin, cut into bands, and 
shred them very fine. Spread these shreds on a sieve to dry for 
a short time, and then put them into a saucepan with half a pint 
of boiling cream, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, three 
ounces of granulated sugar, and half a small glass of brandy. 
Cover the pan with a lid and boil the contents very slowly un- 
til the shredded paste has absorbed the liquids. Remove from 
the fire and add the yolks of three eggs. Stir the whole well 
together and then put the preparation in two buttered tins. 
Have it about one-eighth of an inch thick. Bake in a moderate 
oven until a deep yellow. Spread one layer with jam or any 
desired filling, cover with the other layer, and then cut them 
with a tin cutter in small fancy shapes. 

Silver and Gold Cake together 

One pound of granulated sugar, half a pound of butter, 
three-quarters of a pound of flour, the whites of ten eggs, one 
teaspoonful of bitter almond or lemon flavor. Put the butter 
in a bowl and work it with a wire whisk until creamy. Add 
the sugar and work well for five minutes. "When all is light 
and foamy, add the well-beaten whites and mix well. Sift 
your flour twice, stir it into the mixture, add flavoring, mix 
well, and stir in two drops of rose water. 

In another bowl put one pound of granulated sugar and 
half a pound of butter. With a wire whisk beat to a cream.

Beat the yolks of ten eggs very light, and to them add the 
juice of two lemons and the grated rind of one orange. Beat 
all thoroughly and stir with the butter and sugar. Sift twice 
three-quarters of a pound of flour with one scant teaspoonf ul of 
dry baking soda, add to the mixture, and beat all till very 
light. Butter a square or a round tin, dredge it with flour, 
put your mixtures in, a spoonful at a time, first the white and 
then the yellow, and so on, till your cake pan is full. Bake in 
a moderate oven forty minutes. If your cake gets too brown 
on top, put a piece of heavy white paper over it. Ice with 
clear white icing. Add a little orange paste to some of the 
icing, and ornament the border of the cake with it. Put orange 
leaves in the centre. These leaves can be made by taking white 
rose leaves, covering the surface of each with orange icing, and 
laying them in the crystallized sugar, according to the direc- 
tions in birthday cake.

The whites of seven small eggs and the yolks of five, one cup 
of granulated sugar, two-thirds of a cup of flour, one-third of a 
teaspoon of cream of tartar, and a pinch of salt. Sift, measure, 
and set aside the flour and sugar as for angel cake. Beat the 
yolks of the eggs thoroughly, then after washing the beater, 
beat the whites about half, add the cream of tartar, and beat till 
very stiff. Stir in the sugar lightly, then the beaten yolks 
thoroughly, then add the flour. Put in a tube pan and in the 
oven at once. Bake thirty-five to fifty minutes. 

White Cake 

One cup of milk, one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three 
cups of flour, the whites of eight eggs, two teaspoons of baking 
powder, a little salt, bitter almond flavoring. When this receipt 
is used for layer cake, between the layers and on top of the cake 
use thin icing (not the boiled icing) with fresh cocoanut on 
the icing. 



CHAPTER XIV 
BREADS, PASTES, AND PIES 

Bread 

Fikst of all sift your flour, and be sure you do not leave it 
in a damp place. Let it stand for an hour before you begin to 
make your bread. Put one yeast-cake into one cup of tepid 
water and let it stand in a warm place — not too hot, and in 
about fifteen minutes, if your yeast is good, it will come to the 
surface. At this point add a tablespoon of flour, mix well, and 
let it stand until you are ready to use it. Boil your milk and 
let it get cool, not chilled. Have your flour sifted in a pan — 
not too much, so that you can work it well. Always measure 
your milk. To one yeast-cake you can safely add two quarts, 
or three if the yeast is good and fresh. To the flour add 
one tablespoon of butter, one-half tablespoon of lard, one table- 
spoon of sugar, and one tablespoon of salt. Mix well with the 
flour. Make a hole in the centre and add the milk, next add 
the yeast which you have in the cup to the milk. Mix all well 
together in the bread-pan, adding flour so that you can handle 
it easily. Take it out, lay it on a board, and work well until it 
does not stick to the hands or board, and feels like velvet in 
your hands. When your bread is thoroughly mixed, there will 
appear little bubbles in the dough. Put it back into the pan 
and let it rise over night. In the morning form it into loaves, 
without using any flour or kneading it. Put it into pans and 
let it rise well. Bake in a moderate oven one hour and a half. 

The longer the bread bakes, the sweeter and more wholesome 
it is. A good baker can always tell when bread is well baked

by the sweet odor which comes from the bread on opening the 
oven door ; or if, by taking it in your hand and putting it to 
your ear, you do not detect any hissing, then your bread is 
thoroughly baked. The secret of making good bread is, first, 
have fresh yeast ; second, have your milk of an even tempera- 
ture, neither too hot nor too cold ; third, kneading it well ; 
fourth, keeping it in a warm place, and not forcing it to rise ; 
fifth, having your oven moderate, so that it bakes slowly and 
thoroughly all the way through. 

French Bolls 

One pint of milk, one yeast-cake, whites of two eggs, one 
tablespoon of butter, one tablespoon of sugar, one tablespoon of 
salt, two pounds of flour, or about that quantity. Put your 
yeast-cake in one cup of tepid water and let it stand one hour. 
This is a good way to test yeast ; when it rises to the top, it is 
good. At this point add one heaping tablespoon of flour and 
let it stand until it is required. Scald the milk and let it get 
cold, but not chilled. Sift the flour into a bowl, pour the milk 
in the centre, then add salt, sugar, and butter. It is a good 
plan to add the butter to the milk when it is nearly cold. Next 
add the whites of the eggs, which must be whipped very light. 
Mix well without adding any extra flour, and lastly add the 
yeast. Mix all together with a wire whisk until it is so that 
you can work it with your hands. Then take it out of the bowl 
and work well on a board until it will not stick to the hands or 
board. Put back into the pan and let it rise. When light, take 
out small pieces, roll with the hands on the board, and put them 
in pans close together, so they will keep their shape, and let 
them rise until they are very light ; brush them with egg and 
bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. Before you take 
them out, brush off with melted butter, and give them a few 
minutes more in the oven. Serve, hot, Small rolls may be tied

Parker House Bolls 

One quart and a half of flour, one tablespoon of lard, three 
gills of boiled milk cooled, one-half cup of granulated sugar, 
and three-quarters of a cake of yeast dissolved in quarter of a 
cup of water. Make a hole in the centre of the flour and put 
in the other ingredients. Mix as if making sponge and let it 
rise over night, keeping it moderately warm. In the morning 
knead thoroughly and leave it to rise till noon, then cut with 
a biscuit cutter. Spread one-half of each biscuit with butter, 
and fold over. Place in a pan and leave to rise until nearly 
time to serve. Bake in hot oven for twenty minutes. 

Bolls 

Half a yeast-cake, one pint of milk, one quart of flour, one 
tablespoon of lard. Mix thoroughly and set in a moderately 
warm place until very light. Then knead the dough a little, 
make it into rolls, and place in pans. When they have risen, 
bake in quick oven. 

Potato Yeast 

One quart of potatoes sliced, two quarts and a half of warm 
water, a small bag of hops tied in a cloth. Boil slowly until the 
potatoes are soft. Place in a colander three heaping iron table- 
spoons of flour and over it pour the potatoes and water boiling 
hot. Mash this through the colander, strain, and mash again 
through the colander to avoid lumps. Pour this into a pan or 
crock and add to it one cup of white sugar, one iron tablespoon 
of salt, and one teaspoon of ginger. Let this cool until just 
tepid and add one cake of Fleischman's yeast dissolved. Set 
to rise in a warm place. When very light, bottle.

one tablespoon of butter and one of lard. Pour the mixture 
into the hot fat and with a fork lightly stir in the butter and 
lard. Bake in a steady oven, not too hot, or the bread will 
crack. When the bread is brown, stand the tin on an inverted 
pie plate and bake five or six minutes longer. 

Waffles 

Three eggs, one pint of milk, half a cup of butter, flour 
enough to make a thin batter, two teaspoons of baking powder 
sifted in the mixture, a little salt. Mix well and bake on a 
well-greased waffle iron. See that the iron is hot before pour- 
ing in the batter. 

Waffles 

Cream one-half pound of butter, stirring one way. Add 
one tablespoon of flour and one egg. Mix thoroughly, then 
add another tablespoon of flour and one egg. Continue this 
till eight of each have been stirred in. Always beat the same' 
way. Flavor with a little orange juice. Have the waffle iron 
hot and well greased. Drop the dough and bake to a light 
brown. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and cinnamon. Serve 
hot. 

Batter Cakes 

Two pints of flour, three eggs, one even teaspoon of soda, 
one teaspoon of melted butter, and a little salt. Place the 
flour in a saucepan — tin for lightness, and with a handle, as 
easier to manage. Separate the whites and the yolks of the 
eggs and add the yolks, without beating, to the flour, then stir 
in the buttermilk, mixing slowly. When half mixed, drop in 
the melted butter and beat the mixture hard and smooth. 
Add more buttermilk, finishing it by leaving the batter rather 
thick, as the whites of the eggs will thin it still more. Then 
add the soda, dissolved in cold water, and lastly the beaten 



BREADS, PASTES, AND PIES 369 

whites. Take out the spoon and stir in by lightly beating the 
whites in the batter with a fork. When baking, lay the spoon 
on a plate, that is, do not lay it again in the batter, as it will 
make the cakes heavy. 

For the griddle use beef suet which has been tried out and 
is hard. Waffles are made by this same receipt. 

Wheat Flour Griddle Cakes 

Mix one pint of milk with three eggs, the yolks and whites 
beaten separately. Add four tablespoons of melted butter. 
Sift one and a half cups of flour with one and a half teaspoons 
of baking powder. Add to the above and bake on a hot 
griddle. 

Buckwheat Cakes 

Dissolve half of a compressed yeast-cake in a cup of water, 
mix it with one pint of water, a pinch of salt, and enough buck- 
wheat flour to make a stiff batter. Mix at night, and set the 
batter in a moderately warm place where it will rise. In the 
morning stir the batter briskly, add a tablespoon of molasses 
to make the cakes brown. Should the batter be a little sour, 
dissolve one-quarter of a teaspoon of soda in a little warm 
water and stir it in well. 

St. Louis Buckwheat Cakes 

One pint of buckwheat, one handful of Graham flour, half 
a cup of home-made yeast, salt. Add enough tepid water to 
make a moderately thick batter and beat well. Set this to rise 
early in the evening in a warm place. In the morning add a 
pinch of soda, dissolved, and one tablespoon of molasses and 
stir well. Bake on a griddle greased with beef suet. 

Buckwheat, being heavy, requires all night to lighten. Be 
sure the batter is not too thick when you are ready to bake. 
If it is, add water to thin it.

Mix thoroughly a pint of meal, half that quantity of flour, 
two teaspoons of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Pour 
over this gradually and stir in a quart of fresh milk heated and 
a heaping iron spoon of butter, dripping, or lard. Mix thor- 
oughly again and beat well. Drop with a spoon and bake on 
a hot griddle. An egg or two is sometimes added to this 
receipt. If the corn meal swells a great deal and absorbs the 
milk so that the batter is too thick, add more milk. 

Hoe Cakes 

Mix together a pint of freshly ground yellow corn meal, a 
teaspoon of salt, and two teaspoons of sugar. Over the mixture 
pour enough boiling water to wet it, but not enough to make 
it spread. The water should be boiling, and the meal will 
swell and absorb it if it is hot. Stir well one way. Rub a 
piece of fat bacon over a hot griddle, drop the batter on it 
from a spoon, and gently flat the cake till it is not more than 
half an inch thick. Cook to a golden brown on both sides. A 
small piece of butter may be laid upon the cake as it is turned, 
or the butter may be omitted and the cakes sent to the table 
for dressing. Such cakes are often eaten with scraped maple 
sugar and cream, or again with butter and maple syrup. 

Barley Meal Scones 

In making barley meal scones, proceed as in making cream 
scones, or merely mix fine fresh barley meal with a teaspoon of 
salt and enough hot milk to make a stiff paste. On a floured 
board roll out this paste and cut it in cakes. Bake in a quick 
oven or on a hot griddle upon which fat has been rubbed. 
Serve hot, and buttered if you choose.

Cream Scones 

Having brought to the boiling-point in a saucepan a pint of 
cream, sift in flour enough to make a thick batter and add a 
teaspoon of salt. Put the paste upon a floured board, roll it to 
the thickness of a quarter of an inch, cut in small cakes, and 
cook on a hot griddle ten or fifteen minutes. When brown on 
one side, turn them lightly and brown on the other. Serve on 
a folded napkin. 

Oatmeal Wafers 

Make a batter or dough by stirring together oatmeal, hot 
water, and a little salt. Take the batter on a well-floured 
board, knead it, roll it as thin as possible, cut out in round 
cakes, and cook them till brown and crisp on a griddle. When 
they have browned on one side, they should be turned lightly 
and browned on the other. 

Rice Griddle Cakes 

Wash and scald one cup of rice and drain, and cover with 
boiling water. Cook about half an hour, or until the grains 
are tender. Drain in a colander. Prepare the following bat- 
ter : Sift one teaspoon of baking powder with one cup of flour 
and add a pinch of salt. With this mix one pint of milk with 
three well-beaten eggs and add three tablespoons of melted 
butter, and just before baking stir in the rice. Spread in 
spoonfuls on well-greased hot griddle and brown on both sides. 

Rye Drop Cakes 

Beat separately the yolks and whites of five eggs. Stir 
them together and then stir in one pint and a half of rye flour, 
one pint and four spoonfuls of milk, a pinch of salt, and a piece 
of soda as large as a pea. Put in hot earthen cups and bake.

Flannel Cakes 

Pour one pint of hot milk over two ounces of butter, add 
five eggs, one pint of cold milk, flour enough to make a stiff 
batter, one teaspoon of salt, and two tablespoons of yeast. Set 
the batter in a warm place and let it rise for three hours. 
Butter a griddle and drop on in small cakes. 

Puff Paste 

One pound of butter, one cup of ice water, one pound of 
flour, half a teaspoon of salt. Wash the butter in ice water 
until it is of a creamy substance. Pat it out in a long narrow 
strip with the hand, put it in cheese cloth, and lay flat on the 
ice. Weigh the flour and sift it into a bowl and add salt. 
Mix well and then add water gradually. Mix well, using up 
all your flour. Put your pastry on a board and work well for 
ten minutes, or until it is tough and will not break when 
pulled. The best way to work it is to slap it well on the board 
and to pound it with the rolling pin. By the time your paste 
is well pounded little puffs will appear — this is a very good 
way to test it. Put your paste in the ice-box for twenty min- 
utes, then put it on a board, and with your hands draw it out 
a little longer and wider than your butter. Lay the butter in 
the centre of the paste and fold up, first from the right, then 
from the left, then from you, then next to you. Dust your 
board lightly with flour and turn the folded side of the paste 
on the board. Roll it out, taking care that the butter does not 
come out. Fold it up, giving it three folds, and put it on the 
ice for twenty minutes. Roll out twice more and fold up as 
directed, put it on the ice again for twenty minutes, roll out 
twice more, folding as before. This makes the fourth rolling. 
Put it away in the ice-box until it is well chilled. Cut the 
patties the same size. Take one piece of paste and brush it 
with ice water, then take the second piece and with a small

cutter cut a hole in the centre; place it on top of the first 
piece, and brush the top and side with the yolk of a well- 
beaten egg. After your patties are in the baking pan, give 
them one hour in the ice-box before you place them in a hot 
oven. Bake about twenty-five or thirty minutes. Care and 
judgment must be used while they are baking. 

Cheese Straws 

Use two ounces of butter, two ounces of grated American 
cheese, four ounces of flour, and one egg, salt and white pepper 
to taste, and a dash of cayenne. Work the ingredients with 
your hand ; they become a smooth dough. Roll the dough 
out thin, cut in straws four inches long, and bake on tin sheets 
in a quick oven. 

Cheese Biscuit 

Over puff paste, well rolled out, grate as much well-flavored 
cheese as will thickly cover the paste. Dash upon the cheese 
a slight dust of cayenne, fold the paste over, and roll out thin. 
After you have cut the biscuit in the shape you choose, brush 
them with a paste brush dipped in beaten egg and bake a light 
brown in a quick oven upon a floured baking sheet. 

Cheese Pudding 

With two beaten eggs stir half an ounce of melted butter 
and half a gill of cream. When these are well mixed, add a 
tablespoon of sifted bread crumbs and half a pound of grated 
cheese. Mix thoroughly and bake in a dish lined with puff 
paste. 

Cream Cannelons 

Roll out puff paste very thin, cut it in strips, say two by 
three inches, and roll them round floured round sticks, making 
the edges of the paste meet and forming a continuous paste 



374 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

roll, or, if you like, you may wrap it so that it will have the 
twist of a corkscrew. Bake, and after the baking and the can- 
nelons are cool, remove the sticks. The centres may then be 
filled with whipped cream. Preserves and jellies are also used 
as a filling. To heighten their appearance, the cannelons may 
be brushed with the white of an egg, dusted with sugar, and 
heated again to form a glaze. 

Pastry Roulade 

Roll puff paste very thin, cut it in strips four inches long 
and one and a half inches wide. Roll on sticks which are 
about as large in circumference as a five-cent piece, and which 
you buy for the purpose. Place on a tin sheet and bake in a 
quick oven. Fill with whipped cream, apple sauce, or cream 
and preserves mixed together. 

Log Cabin Dessert 

Cut strips of pastry three inches long and one inch wide. 
"When baked, spread each strip with jam and place them on a 
dish, log cabin style. Fill the centre space with whipped cream. 

Metropolitan Cake 

Roll puff paste about a quarter of an inch thick and cut out 
two pieces each about eight inches square. Take one square 
and spread the centre with marmalade of apricots or peaches. 
Take the other square, brush the under part with cold water, 
and place it on the marmalade. Press the edges of pastry to- 
gether. Brush the top with beaten egg. Bake on baking sheet 
in moderate oven for fifteen minutes. Sprinkle with powdered 
sugar. 

Pastry Ramekins 

Roll some puff paste rather thin, sprinkle it with Parmesan 
cheese, then fold it over. Repeat this three times. Cut with 



BREADS, PASTES, AND PIES 375 

a paste cutter any shape desired, brush these pieces with the 
yolk of an egg, and bake in a quick oven. When done, serve 
them at once. 

Surprise Pastry 

Roll puff paste out thin and bake in two round jelly tins. 
Slice peaches, bananas, or any kind of fruit, and put between 
the layers. Cover the whole completely with whipped cream. 

Maorotes, a Jewish Receipt 

Take one pound of French roll dough, six ounces of fresh 
butter, two eggs, and as much flour as will be necessary to knead 
these together. Roll it in the form of a long French roll and 
cut off thin round slices. Set them at a short distance from 
the fire to rise, and when light fry in the best Florence oil. 
When nearly cold, dip them in clarified sugar flavored with 
essence of lemon. 

Pie Pastry 

Have at hand two quarts of sifted flour, one cup of lard, one 
of butter, one tablespoon of salt, two of sugar, and one cup and 
a half of cold water. Put one cup of the flour into a bowl with 
the salt, sugar, lard, and butter. Chop until all are thoroughly 
blended and then pour in the water gradually. When it is 
well mixed, you should have a stiff paste. Sprinkle some of the 
flour from the half cup on a board, put the paste on it, and roll 
it with a floured rolling pin until it is about one-quarter of an 
inch thick. Fold the paste over and roll it out again. Do this 
three or four times. Then put it on ice, so that it will become 
chilled. Lard may be omitted and all butter used ; if so, you 
will need two cups and a half instead of one cup of butter. 
Lard makes the paste richer and more tender, but butter gives 
it the good flavor. Use as little flour as possible on the mould- 
ing board. 



376 MBS. SEELY'S cook book 

Pie Pastry 

Mix one very full hand of flour, or two handfuls for an 
upper and an under crust, and a little salt. Some time before 
making the pastry, place lard in a bowl with a good piece of ice 
and water. When the lard is very firm, take one heaping table- 
spoon of lard to each handful of flour. Mix quickly with a 
spoon and handle as little as possible, that the heat of the hand 
may not affect it. Wet with the ice water just soft enough to 
roll easily. Use a good deal of flour in rolling and a heavy 
rolling pin, and fold and roll the crust twice. Bake in a well- 
heated oven. Pastry is best baked as quickly as possible, with- 
out turning. 

Apple Pie 

Slice the apples and rinse them in cold water. Set on the 
stove with a very little sugar and stew until they are half done. 
Place in the crust, add water, and bake. When done, with a 
sharp knife remove the upper crust, sweeten to taste, add a good- 
sized piece of butter, and if desired, nutmeg. Return the crust, 
and when cold sift over the pie powdered sugar. 

To prepare Fruit for Pies 

Always stew the fruit before placing it in a pie or a crust. 
Sugar and flavor and sprinkle over it a little flour before putting 
on the upper crust. 

Cream Pie 

Pour one pint of cream over one cup of sugar. Add the 
beaten whites of four eggs and a pinch of salt. Flavor with 
nutmeg and bake without an upper crust. 

Lemon Pie 

Dissolve two tablespoons of corn- starch in a little cold water 
and stir it into one pint of boiling water. Beat well the yolks 



BREADS, PASTES, AND PIES 377 

of three eggs with half a cup of granulated sugar, add the 
grated rind of one lemon and the juice of two lemons, and stir 
into the corn-starch. Line a pie dish with pastry, fill with the 
lemon mixture, and bake in a moderate oven. Beat the whites 
of the eggs to a stiff froth with half a cup of sugar, flavor with 
lemon. Spread the meringue over the pie and place in a quick 
oven long enough to become a delicate brown. 



Lemon Pie 

Grate the rind and squeeze the juice of two large lemons, add 
three cups of sugar, four eggs, yolks and whites beaten sepa- 
rately, four tablespoons of flour, two teacups of water, and the 
last thing the whites of the eggs. Bake without an upper 
crust. 

Lemon Pie 

First grate the rind of a fine large lemon, take out the pulp 
and chop it with a chopping knife. Then mix one cup of water, 
one cup of sugar (or half a cup of molasses and half a cup of 
sugar), one tablespoon of flour dissolved, and set this mixture 
in a pot of hot water over the fire to thicken, stirring constantly. 
When well thickened, pour it over the chopped lemon. After 
it cools a little, add one beaten egg. Bake in a deep pan with 
both upper and under crust. Make a rich pastry for it. 



Orange Pie 

Take two fine oranges and grate the rind and all except the 
leathery dividing skin of the centre, carefully taking out all 
the seeds. Add one cup of sugar, three tablespoons of cream, 
and the yolks of three eggs. Make a meringue of the whites 
of the eggs and a little sugar. Bake with an under crust.

Potato Pie 

Take one pound of Irish potatoes rubbed through a colander, 
one pound of sugar, a quarter of a pound of butter, six eggs, 
the whites well beaten, and the grated rind and peel of one 
lemon. Let the hot potatoes fall from the colander on the butter 
and mix well. Add the yolks of the eggs and the sugar well 
beaten together, the lemon, and lastly the whites of the eggs 
stirred in lightly. Pour into a paste-lined dish and bake. This 
receipt makes two pies. 

Pumpkin Pie 

Mix one quart of milk with two teacups of strained boiled 
pumpkin, one cup of granulated sugar, three well-beaten eggs, 
one teaspoon of ground cinnamon, one teaspoon of ginger, and 
salt to taste. Line pie dishes with pie pastry and fill with the 
mixture. Bake in a hot oven. 

Mince Pie 

One bowl of cooked beef, chopped fine, one bowl and a half 
of chopped suet, one bowl and a half of chopped apples, half a 
cup of melted butter, two bowls of sweet cider, two bowls of 
granulated sugar, one bowl of Port wine, one bowl of brandy, 
one bowl of stoned raisins, one and a half bowls of currants, 
half a bowl of citron that has been cut thin and in small pieces, 
ground cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg to taste. Mix well and 
bake in pie paste. 

Mince Pie 

Boil a beef's tongue two hours, then skin it and chop it as 
small as possible. Chop very fine three pounds of fresh beef 
suet, three pounds of good baking apples, four pounds of cur- 
rents which have been washed, picked over, and dried, and one 
pound of raisins, cleaned and stoned. Mix all these well with 



BREADS, PASTES, AND PIES 379 

one pound of powdered sugar, half an ounce of mace, half an 
ounce of grated nutmeg, and a quarter of an ounce each of 
cloves and cinnamon ; add one pint of French brandy. Make 
a rich puff paste, lay the mince meat on the under crust, and 
upon the meat spread bits of candied citron and orange peel 
and then cover with an upper crust and bake. 

The mince meat should be kept in an earthen jar when await- 
ing use. Do not add the citron or orange until you bake.

Salted Almonds 

Shell the necessary quantity of almonds and pour boiling 
water over them. Then remove the skins. For each cup of 
almonds add one tablespoon of olive oil. Mix them well and 
let them soak for an hour. Sprinkle them with salt, a table- 
spoon to each cup. Bake in moderate oven until they are a 
delicate brown. While baking, occasionally shake the pan. 

Candied Rose Leaves 

Put half a pound of granulated sugar, three drops of lemon, 
and half a cup of water in a saucepan. Let the liquid boil to a 
crack. Test by dropping a little in cold water. When it will 
snap apart and stick to your fingers, it is done. Remove from 
the fire. Stir and rub against the side of the saucepan until 
cool — not cold. The constant stirring and rubbing make the 
liquid white and granular. Dip each rose leaf in this, roll 
round, and spread on a well-oiled board to dry. 

Syrup to Fasten Rose Leaves to Cake 

Boil one cup of granulated sugar and four tablespoons of 
water until, when tested, the syrup sticks to your fingers and 
forms a thread. Dip the ends of the leaves in this and with a 
brush moisten the cake where the leaf is to be applied.

Candy Dough 

In one glass put the white of an egg, in another one put an 
equal quantity of water. Mix them slowly with half a pound 
of icing sugar and stir until it is dough-like. 

Almond Creams 

Blanch the almonds and cover them with candy dough. 
The outsides may be varied in looks to suit the taste. 

Cream Dates 

From fresh dates take out the stones. Lay a roll of candy 
dough in its place, press together, and lay away to stiffen. 

Chocolate Creams 

Boil together for five minutes half a cup of cream and two 
cups of granulated sugar. Set the dish in another of cold water 
and stir till the cream is hard enough to make into balls, first 
flavoring with vanilla. Melt the chocolate, and dip in the balls. 

Chocolate Cream Caramels 

Put twelve ounces of chocolate in a saucepan with one pint 
of chocolate syrup — sold by any grocer, or made after receipt 
on page 395, — and one tablespoon of vanilla. When the liquid 
begins to melt, add one pint of rich cream and one pound and a 
half of granulated sugar. Let all come to a boil, and when it 
begins to boil, stir it constantly until it becomes a large ball — 
which will be in about ten minutes. Pour into slightly oiled 
pans or on a marble slab. This caramel will take a long time 
to cool. Cut in long strips, then across in inch squares. Fold 
each one in oil paper as you cut it.

Cream Candies 

Melt four cups of sugar and two cups of water. Add three 
heaping tablespoons of arrowroot and a pinch of cream of 
tartar. Boil up and pour into buttered moulds. 

Cocoanut Drops 

Take one pound of grated cocoanut, half a pound of pulver- 
ized sugar, and the whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth. 
You must have enough of the white of egg to wet the sugar and 
cocoanut. Beat well together and drop on buttered plates in 
drops the size of a five-cent piece, and bake. 

Cocoanut Drops 

One cocoanut grated fine, half a pound of pulverized sugar, 
and the whites of two eggs beaten to a froth. Drop on buttered 
paper and bake in a quick oven. 

Walnut Creams 

Take perfect half meats of walnuts, press on either side of a 
candy dough marble, and set away to harden. 

Hickory Nut Kisses 

Beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, add one pound 
of granulated sugar, and one cup of hickory nut meats chopped 
rather fine. Drop from teaspoons upon buttered paper and bake 
fifteen minutes in a moderate oven. 

French Nougat 

Pour boiling water over half a pound of almonds. Let them 
stand for five minutes. Remove the skins, and wash them. Cut 
each one in eight long strips, then put them in the oven to dry. 



CANDIES, PRESERVES, AND PICKLES 383 

In a copper or enamelled saucepan put five ounces of granulated 
sugar and stir carefully over the fire until colored brown, then 
add your almonds, which should be slightly brown and very hot. 
Mix all well together. Rub a little oil over a pan and pour in 
the mixture. Cut into pieces about four inches long and two 
inches wide. When cold, they are ready for use. 

Pudge 

Two cups of granulated sugar, half a cup of milk, a piece 
of butter a little larger than an egg, a little salt, and seven tea- 
spoons of Baker's cocoa. Boil twelve minutes. Add three 
teaspoons of vanilla and stir for three minutes. Remove from 
the fire. Pour, caramel thickness, into buttered tins. When 
partially cold, mark off in squares. 

A College Girl's Pudge 

Take two cups of granulated sugar and one cup of milk, 
and after heating add two heaping tablespoons of chocolate 
and a piece of butter the size of an egg. Boil for twenty or 
thirty minutes. To test it, stir a little in a saucer. If it 
hardens when cold, it is fudge. As you take it from the fire, 
you may add a teaspoon of vanilla and some walnut meats, say 
a cup to the above proportions, or not, just as you please. 
Either with or without, it is fudge. When it is once off the 
fire, stir the mixture till it begins to stiffen, pour it in shallow 
buttered pans, mark off into squares, and set away to cool. 

Maple Sugar Fudge 

Follow the above receipt except in case of sugar. In this 
receipt take a cup and a half of maple sugar and half a cup of 
granulated sugar, and proceed as above directed.

Butter Scotch 

Melt together two tablespoons of sugar, three of molasses, 
one of water, and two of butter. Pour in a buttered dish and 
set away to cool. 

Sugared Popcorn 

Take one cup of brown sugar, three tablespoons of water, 
and a lump of butter. Let the mixture boil until it holds 
together in water. Then add three quarts of popped corn and 
stir well. Care should be taken to use a kettle large enough 
to hold the corn. 

Candied Popcorn 

Cook one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, and three cups 
of molasses together until the mixture hardens in water, then 
stir in the popped corn. 

Old-fashioned Cough Candy 

Pour over a gill of whole flaxseed half a pint of boiling 
water. In another dish, holding a cup of slippery elm, pour also 
enough boiling water to cover. Let these stand for two hours, 
then strain both into a porcelain kettle containing a pound and 
a half of granulated sugar wet with the juice of two lemons. 
Press the strainer holding the seed and the elm in order to get 
their healing substances. Boil the mixture till it candies, and 
then pour it on pans on which buttered paper has been spread. 

St. Louis Molasses Candy 

Put one tablespoon of butter, one cup of sugar, and two 
tablespoons of water in a kettle. When the mixture boils, add 
half a cup of molasses. Boil fifteen or twenty minutes, or 
longer, according to test. Add nut meats just before pouring 
in buttered tins. Spread it as thin as possible.

Glazed Fruits 

Put two pounds of cut sugar and two gills of cold water in a 
sugar boiler over the fire and boil until the top is covered with 
large bubbles. Test it by dropping a little into cold water. 
When it snaps, it is done. Wipe the sides of the boiler occa- 
sionally to remove the sugar that is apt to collect. Remove the 
boiler from the fire and dip the fruits in the sugar. Then lay 
them on a dish rubbed with a little olive oil. 

Cranberry Jelly a la Cereal 

Put one quart of cranberries with three cups of sugar and 
half a cup of hot water in a porcelain-lined saucepan over a 
slow fire for ten minutes, or until the sugar is thoroughly melted. 
Do not let them boil. Be careful not to stir them. Shake the 
saucepan back and forth on the range. When the sugar is 
dissolved, and the syrup is a bright red, pour the jelly in moulds 
to jell. The berries must be whole. 

Cranberry Jelly 

One quart of cranberries, one pint of granulated sugar, and 
half a pint of water. Cook the cranberries in the water for 
twenty minutes. Then rub through a fine sieve and add the 
sugar. Cook ten minutes longer. Do not add more or less of 
the liquid or sugar, or the jelly will not mould. It should boil 
all the time it is cooking. The time during which an article is 
coming to the boiling-point cannot be counted by any rule. 
The moment the liquid has cooked ten minutes, turn it into a 
mould and set it in a cool place for twelve hours or more. 
Cranberries should always be cooked in porcelain. 

Currant Jelly 

Remove the leaves, not the stems, and carefully pick over 
and wash the currants. Drain thoroughly. Put them in a

386 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

porcelain-lined preserving kettle and stew until they are reduced 
to a soft pulp. Rub the pulp through a colander. Then strain 
twice through a flannel bag. Be sure to get all the juice. 
Measure it, and to one pint of juice have one pound and a 
quarter of granulated sugar. Put the sugar where it will 
become thoroughly warmed, — on the shelf over the range is a 
good place. Boil the juice eighteen minutes after it begins to 
boil. Remove, and gradually stir in the warm sugar. Stir until 
the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, or when it jells the sugar 
will come to the top. Pour into jelly glasses and set in a cool 
place. The second or third day, soak pieces of white paper in 
alcohol, brandy, or whiskey, put them on the jelly, and cover 
the glasses with paper or tin cover. 

Preserved Apples 

Peal, core, and chop two pounds of fine acid apples. Mean- 
while have boiling two pounds of sugar, three gills of water, 
and two ounces of ginger. When this syrup is thick, stir in 
the two pounds of chopped apples and boil till the apples are 
thick and clear. 

Brandied Peaches 

Select ripe White Heath peaches, rub each one smooth and 
clean, and boil until tender in syrup made as follows : A pound 
and a half of granulated sugar thoroughly dissolved in one 
quart of hot water. When the peaches are cooked, you can 
test them with a broom straw. Place them on a dish to cool. 
If you desire them extra strong of spirits, cover them with pure 
spirits or white brandy. When they have cooled, drain them 
and ascertain their weight. To one pound of fruit have half 
a pound of granulated sugar. Dissolve the sugar in a little 
water, place it on the stove and let it come to a boil, skim it, 
and to each pint of sugar syrup add one pint of fresh brandy 



CANDIES, PRESERVES, AND PICKLES 387 

or spirits. Place the peaches in glass jars, fill each one with the 
hot syrup. The jars must have air-tight covers and be sealed 
while the contents are very hot. 

Brandied Pears 
Peal the pears and follow the receipt for peaches. 

Brandied Plums 

Prick the plums and proceed as for brandied peaches, cook- 
ing the fruit less. 

Spiced Pears 

Take one teaspoon of whole cloves,. one tablespoon of all- 
spice, and one tablespoon of cinnamon. Crush them slightly 
and boil one minute in a quart of vinegar and a pint of sugar 
mixed. Select a fine variety of pear, halve them, taking out 
the seeds, boil them in water until nearly tender, and finish 
them in the syrup, cooking them not too soft. Cover them 
well with syrup and place them in small, stone jars. Tie a cover 
over the jar. 

Spiced Peaches 

Are made the same as spiced pears, except that they are not 
boiled in water. The syrup will cook them sufficiently. 

Black Raspberry Jam 

Take one crate of berries, and, dividing them, crush one-half, 
heat in a preserving kettle, and then put them through a sieve. 
Add the liquid to the other half of the berries, set them over 
the fire, add a quarter of a pound of sugar to each box of berries, 
and boil till the jam is thick. Put in glasses, cover with para- 
fin, and set away for use. 



388 MBS. SMELT'S cook book 

Red Raspberry Jam 

Take twelve boxes of berries, the juice of seven fine lemons, 
and ten pounds of sugar. Cook thoroughly in a preserving 
kettle and put in glasses, as in above receipt. 

Rhubarb 

Wash and cut in small pieces one pound of fresh rhubarb. 
Put in a baking dish with one cup of sugar, a cup of water, 
the thinnest possible shaving of lemon peel, and a bit of ginger. 
Cover and bake. When quite tender, remove from the oven 
and set aside to cool, removing the bits of lemon peel. Put 
two tablespoons of gelatine to soak in cold water and then 
dissolve it in a little hot water. Add to the rhubarb with 
a tablespoon of lemon juice. Pour into a mould and let it 
harden on the ice. Serve with whipped cream. 

Rhubarb Jelly 

Rhubarb jelly is made by putting the rhubarb, cut in small 
pieces, to cook in just enough water to cover it. Add a bit 
of lemon peel and cook slowly for ten minutes. For every 
pound of the rhubarb — weighed before it is cooked — add half 
a pound of sugar. Add gelatine enough to make a good, firm 
jelly when cold. 

Strawberry Preserves 

Weigh one pound of granulated sugar to one pound of 
large, ripe strawberries. Hull the berries, and, if it is nec- 
essary, wash them before hulling, and drain and thoroughly 
dry them. Place the sugar in a preserving kettle, with just 
enough water to prevent the sugar sticking to the bottom, and 
boil until it becomes a thick syrup. Skim off the scum that 
comes to the top. When the syrup is thick and clear, drop in 



CANDIES, PRESERVES, AND PICKLES 389 

enough berries to float on the top, but not to crowd them. 
Let them boil twenty minutes. Remove them carefully — do 
not break them — and put them in air-tight jars. Boil the 
syrup for half an hour and while hot strain over the berries. 
Seal the jars and set them in a cool place. 

Wintergreen Berry Jam a la Polonaise 

After cleaning the berries, scald them for a moment, then 
take half a pound of sugar to one pound of berries, and cook in 
a porcelain kettle until the berries are clear and transparent. 
Grate orange rind very fine and add as a flavoring to taste. 
The berries should be stirred while cooking to prevent burning. 

Chili Sauce 

Chop and boil together two hours six dozen large, ripe toma- 
toes, one dozen green peppers, one dozen white onions, twelve 
tablespoons of salt, twenty-four tablespoons of brown sugar, 
twelve teaspoons each of ginger, cloves, and cinnamon. The 
kettle used here, as in cooking all acids, should be porcelain. 
While hot pour in bottles and seal hermetically. 

Chili Sauce 

Have at hand eighteen ripe tomatoes, six onions, six small 
red peppers, nine tablespoons of sugar, two cups of vinegar, 
and salt to taste. Peel the tomatoes and onions and remove 
the seeds and core from the peppers. Chop all very fine, add 
the sugar and salt, and boil in a porcelain kettle until the 
sauce becomes thick. While hot pour in air-tight jars. 

Pepper Hash 

Take one good-sized cabbage chopped fine, remove the 
seeds and core from twelve green peppers and two red peppers, 



390 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

chop them, also two small teacups of grated horseradish, two 
ounces of whole cloves, two ounces of white mustard seed, half 
an ounce of celery seed, and about two quarts of cider vinegar. 
Sprinkle the chopped cabbage with salt. Let it stand for an 
hour. Then with the hand squeeze out all the water. After 
chopping the peppers, cover them with salt. Let them stand 
one hour. Press all the water from them through a colander 
or sieve, using a spoon, for the liquid would burn the hands. 
Mix all together and cover with vinegar. 

Cucumber Fickle 

Make a brine strong enough to hold up an egg. When 
boiling hot, pour over six hundred pickles and four green pep- 
pers. The pickles must be covered with the brine. Let them 
stand for twenty-four hours. Drain and thoroughly dry each 
one, then cover with boiling vinegar, and stand for twenty- 
four hours. Drain, heat fresh vinegar, and add the following 
ingredients to it: One ounce of whole cloves, one ounce of cin- 
namon sticks, one ounce of whole allspice, two quarts of brown 
sugar, half a pint of whole mustard seed, and four tablespoons 
of whole celery seed. While this mixture is boiling hot, pour 
it over the cucumbers. Place in a stone crock or glass jars. 
Remove the cores and nearly all the seeds from the peppers. 

Stuffed Cucumbers 
Pack medium-sized cucumbers in dry salt. In two weeks 
take them from the brine, soak them three days in fresh water, 
changing the water each day. Without rinsing, place them in 
a kettle in layers, between each layer add sliced onion, red 
(Chili) pepper, strips of horseradish, and a small quantity of 
sugar. When the kettle is half full, place in the middle a 
small quantity of whole spice — cinnamon, allspice, and cloves 
(less of cloves) — tied in a cloth. Cover with cold vinegar. 



CANDIES, PRESERVES, AND PICKLES 391 

Stand on the stove and let them slowly come to a boil, and at 
once take them off and place in jars. 

Open the cucumbers lengthwise, cut a small piece out of 
each half, fill the opening with strips of horseradish and black 
and white mustard seeds, wet with olive oil. Put the two 
halves together and tie with narrow strips of cheese-cloth. 
Put the cucumbers back in the vinegar to keep until needed. 
Serve after cutting and removing the binding. 

French Pickle 

Three quarts of sliced green tomatoes, one quart of sliced 
white onions, and three quarts of peeled and sliced cucumbers. 
Place all in a stone jar and sprinkle with one cup of salt. Let 
them stand twenty-four hours, then drain off the water and 
add half an ounce of celery seed, a quarter of an ounce of 
cloves or mace, one teacup of white mustard seed, and half a 
cup of black pepper. Blend one tablespoon of tumeric with a 
little water and two tablespoons of ground mustard. Add to 
the pickles and cover with one gallon of the best cider vinegar. 

Oil Pickle 

Peel and slice rather thick one hundred large cucumbers. 
Place them in a colander with salt between the layers. Put 
one-third as many white onions as you have cucumbers in a 
colander, and treat in the same manner as the cucumbers. Let 
them stand for three hours. Mix one-half pound of Coleman's 
mustard the same as you would for table use. Spread a layer 
of cucumbers in the bottom of a stone jar, then a layer of 
onions, then mustard, then moisten with olive oil. You will 
need one quart of oil for the above quantity. Spread another 
layer of cucumbers, onions, etc., and continue until the jar is 
two-thirds full. Cover all with cold vinegar. Tie a cloth 
over the jar and set in a cool place for a month or six weeks.

Green Tomato Pickle 

Half a peck of green tomatoes, a dozen onions, half a dozen 
red peppers, half a dozen green peppers, half a pound of white 
mustard seed, and two ounces of celery seed. Slice the toma- 
toes in a stone jar and sprinkle salt between each layer. 
Cover with boiling water and let them stand over night. In 
the morning drain them thoroughly and scald them in a 
liquid made half of vinegar and half of water. Drain again. 
Place in a stone jar alternate layers of the tomatoes and the 
mixture of the mustard and celery seed, the sliced onions, and 
the peppers from which the seeds and cores are removed. 
Cover with vinegar. 

Green Tomato Pickle 

Take a peck of green tomatoes, two large green peppers, 
four large onions, a scant cup of grated horseradish, an ounce 
each of ground allspice, cinnamon, and white pepper, and a tea- 
cup of brown sugar. Cut the tomatoes in thin slices and 
place them in an earthen crock in layers. Sprinkle each layer 
lightly with salt and in the morning drain off the water. 
Remove the seeds and cores from the peppers, chop the onions, 
peppers, and tomatoes in small pieces, mix with the other 
ingredients in a porcelain-lined kettle, cover with cider vine- 
gar, and stew gently until tender. Place in an earthen crock 
or in glass jars. Keep in a cool place. 



CHAPTER XVI 

BEVERAGES 
Beverages 

Always observe the following rules when compounding 
any cold beverage : — 

Be sure to serve it ice cold and not too sweet. Have one 
piece of ice as large as possible, to use in the pitcher or bowl 
intended for serving. Small pieces of ice melt quickly and 
weaken the beverages. The sugar, fruit, and all ingredients, 
except the wine, ice, and carbonated water, should be mixed 
thoroughly and placed in the ice-box for at least three-quarters 
of an hour before they are served. Fifteen minutes before 
serving add the wine, except Champagne, stir well, and pour 
into the pitcher or bowl in which a large piece of ice has just 
been placed. Champagne and any carbonated water should not 
be added until just before serving. 

Barley Water 

Wipe very clean two tablespoons of pearl barley. Put it in 
a quart jug with three or four lumps of sugar, a pinch or two 
of salt, and a strip of lemon peel. Fill up the jug with boiling 
water and shake the mixture gently for some minutes. Then 
cover it and let it stand until perfectly cold. In twelve hours 
it will be fit for use. Made in this way the barley water will 
be comparatively clear and soft and pleasant to drink. 

If the flavor of lemon is unpalatable to the invalid, or the 
sugar makes it too sweet, these ingredients may be omitted or 
modified. 

393 



394 MBS. seely's cook book 

A glass of • calf 's-f oot jelly added to the barley is much 
appreciated by some. After the barley water has been poured 
off, the jug may be filled a second time with boiling water. 

Barley Water 

Put two ounces of well- washed pearl barley in a porcelain- 
lined saucepan with a quart of water, the grated rind and juice 
of a lemon, and two ounces of seeded raisins. Boil steadily 
until the liquor is reduced one-half. Strain and sweeten while 
warm. 

Barley Negas 

Boil two tablespoons of barley in a quart of water. Add 
a pint of Sherry, the juice of half a large lemon, a dash of nut- 
meg, and sweeten to taste. 

A Bishop 

Stick cloves in the rind of a lemon or orange and roast it 
a long time before a slow fire. Put equal quantities of cinna- 
mon, cloves, allspice, and mace into a little water, and boil 
them until the whole strength is extracted. Boil a bottle of 
Port or claret wine and put the roast lemon and spice into it. 
Sweeten, and add the juice of half a lemon and grate in some 
nutmeg. Serve hot with the lemon and spice floating in it. 

Blackberry Cordial 

Heat the berries, press them through a colander, and strain 
the juice. To three pints of juice use one pound of sugar. 
Tie in a small bag the whole spice of cinnamon, clove, and 
allspice. Use clove very sparingly. Boil fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Add California brandy to taste. 



BEVERAGES 395 

Caudle 

Mix two tablespoons of oatmeal in a quart of water with a 
blade or two of mace and a piece of lemon peel. Stir often, 
and let the mixture boil twenty minutes. Strain and sweeten, 
and add a little white wine, nutmeg, and a little lemon juice. 

Chocolate Syrup 

Mix three tablespoons of scraped chocolate with one pint of 
boiling water. Let the mixture boil up, then add one pint of 
sugar, and boil three minutes. When cold, add one tablespoon 
of vanilla. 

Put two tablespoons of the syrup and two of cracked ice in 
a glass, and fill the glass with milk. Add two tablespoons of 
whipped cream. Stir well. 

Brandy Cocktail 
Fill a small bar glass one-third full of shaved ice, and on it 
place three or four dashes of gum syrup, two dashes of Angos- 
tura bitters, one wine-glass of brandy, and one or two dashes 
of curagoa. Shake well together, strain into a cocktail glass, 
twist a small piece of lemon rind in it, and serve at once. 

Holland Gin Cocktail 

Fill a small bar glass one-third full of shaved ice, add two 
or three dashes of Boker's bitters, one wine-glass of Holland 
gin, and one or two dashes of curagoa. Shake, and strain into 
a cocktail glass, twist a small piece of lemon rind in it, and 
serve at once. 

Manhattan Cocktail 

Take two dashes of curagoa or maraschino, one pony of rye 
whiskey, one wine-glass of vermouth, three dashes of Boker's 
bitters, and two small lumps of ice, put into a small bar glass, 
shake well, and pour into a claret or cocktail glass. If one 
prefers it rather sweet, add two dashes of gum syrup. 



396 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Martini Cocktail 

Put two small lumps of ice in a small bar glass, add one 
dash, of Boker's bitters, two dashes of maraschino, one pony 
of Old Tom gin, and one wine-glass of vermouth. Shake 
thoroughly and strain into a large cocktail glass. Put a 
quarter of a slice of lemon in the glass and serve. If pre- 
ferred very sweet, add 'two dashes of gum syrup. 

Tom Gin Cocktail 
The same as Holland gin cocktail, except the substituting 
Tom gin in place of the Holland gin. 

Whiskey Cocktail 

Take three or four dashes of gum syrup in a small bar glass, 
filled one-third full of shaved ice, add two dashes of Boker's 
bitters, and one wine-glass of whiskey. Shake, and strain into 
a cocktail glass. Twist a small piece of lemon rind in it and 
serve at once. 

Boiled Coffee 

Use as much ground coffee as is needed, allowing one table- 
spoon of coffee to one cup of boiling water. Place on the range, 
and when it comes to a boil, uncover and remove from the fire. 
Let it stand two or three minutes, then cover it, and replace 
over the fire. The instant it boils, remove and let it stand 
five minutes. It is then ready to serve. Sometimes an egg 
is beaten up and with a little cold water is mixed with the 
coffee before the boiling water is poured on. This is to clear it. 

Black Coffee 
Place six tablespoons of ground coffee in the strainer of 
a drip coffee-pot. Pour over it three cups of boiling water. 
Let it stand a minute or two after it has drained and then 
serve. The coffee must be ground very fine and the water 
must be boiling. 



BEVERAGES 397 

Austrian Coffee 
A coffee of the above name, sometimes served at teas and 
receptions, is a cold, strong coffee, creamed and sweetened. It 
is served in small glasses, with a tablespoon of ice cream added 
to each glass after the coffee is put in. 

A Breakfast Coffee 

Three-quarters of a teacup of ground coffee, Java and 
Mocha mixed. Three-quarters of a pint of cold water. Stir 
together the yolk and white of an egg, and pour a third with 
a piece of the shell into the coffee. Mix well, add a pint and 
a half of boiling water, and boil quickly five minutes. Stir 
the coffee, set back, and boil slowly ten or fifteen minutes 
more, and add a little cold water to settle. Strain into the 
cups. 

Cold Cocoa 

To make one cup, mix one heaping teaspoon of cocoa with 
sugar to taste in a little hot water. Then fill the glass with 
rich cold milk or cream. 

Cider Cup 

Fill a pitcher with cracked ice and over it pour one quart 
of cider, add one small spoonful of sugar, and one bottle of 
club soda. Decorate the top with different kinds of thinly 
sliced fruits and a bunch of young mint. Serve at once. 

Champagne Cup 

Two gills of brandy, two gills of red curacoa, one gill of 
green Chartreuse, a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, and the 
juice of five lemons. After mixing, pour into a pitcher in which 
there is a large piece of ice. Then add a quart and a half of 
Champagne and one quart of Apollinaris. 



398 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Claret Cup 

Ice the claret in the bottle, also the club soda. Do not 
put ice in the pitcher. Mix one teaspoonful of crushed mint 
juice with the juice of one lemon, one teaspoonful of sugar, two 
ponies of brandy, two ponies of curacoa. When thoroughly 
mixed in a glass pitcher, add one bottle of claret and one bottle 
of club soda fresh from the ice, the thin peel of a whole lemon, 
a few slices of orange and pineapple, and decorate the top with 
a bunch of young mint, which has been slightly dampened and 
sprinkled with powdered sugar it give it a frosted appearance. 

Claret Cup 

Five lumps of sugar dissolved in water, one liqueur glass 
of Medford rum, one quart of good claret, one orange and one 
lime sliced thin, and the juice of one lemon. Place the paring 
of a cucumber and a large piece of ice in a good-sized pitcher, 
stir thoroughly, and after a few moments remove the cucumber 
rind. Then add one bottle of club soda and place a bunch of 
mint in the pitcher. 

Champagne may be used in place of the soda. In place 

of the cucumber and mint use sliced pineapple and any small 

fruit. 

Military Cup 

Into a tumbler put five small lumps of ice and over the ice 
squeeze a lemon. The lemon should be a fine one and good 
for six vigorous squeezes before it is dry. After the lemon 
juice has trickled over the ice, throw in two teaspoons of fine 
sugar, and over the sugar pour claret until the ice is covered. 
Shake the mixture and pour it in a punch bowl which you have 
close at hand. In the tumbler make the same mixture five more 
times. At length when the punch bowl holds the claret, lemon 
juice, sugar, and ice pour in its midst a tablespoon of Benedic- 
tine cordial. Ladle this in freely and then add a quarter of a 
wine-glass of fine brandy. If you choose, add also half a glass 



BEVERAGES 399 

of Sherry. Stir well with the ladle and if you like float a half 
dozen berries on the punch. Serve by ladling a glass half full 
of the punch and then filling it with iced seltzer. The seltzer 
should be put in with such force that it will mix with the 
punch. Place a paper straw or two in each glass. 

Moselle Cup 
To four small lumps of sugar dissolved in a little water, add 
one quart of Moselle wine, one liqueur glass of Medford rum, one 
orange and one lime — both sliced thin. Pour all in a pitcher 
over a large piece of ice and place on ice. When thoroughly 
chilled add one bottle of club soda. Place a bunch of mint 
stems down in the top of the pitcher. Crush a leaf or two of 
mint with some sugar in the bottom of the pitcher before you 
pour in the ingredients. 

Rhine Wine Cup 
Ice the Rhine wine and club soda in a glass pitcher. In 
a glass pitcher mix one glass of maraschino with one glass of 
curacoa. Add one quart of Rhine wine and a bottle of club 
soda. Decorate with thinly sliced fruits and place a bunch of 
verbena on top just before serving. Do not have any ice in 
the pitcher. 

Egg Flip 

To three beaten eggs add a quarter of a pound of sugar and 
a pint of boiling water, stirring well, and adding the water a 
little at a time. When the water is well stirred in, add half a 
pint of brandy and half a gill of rum and serve hot. 

Egg Lemonade 

Make a good New York lemonade by using one lemon to a 

tumbler. Add sugar enough to make it of the sweetness your 

taste wishes — it gains by being on the side of sour, that is, in 

wanting a little in sweetness, and then break into the tumbler 



400 MRS. SMELT'S COOK BOOK 

an absolutely fresh egg. Fill the glass nearly full of Vichy, or 
Apollinaris, or of pure cold water, and shake vigorously, hav- 
ing capped the tumbler with a metal shaker. When the egg 
is well lost in the liquid, it is ready to drink cold. 

Egg Nog 

Put a little shaved ice in a large glass and add one egg, 
half a wine-glass of brandy, half a wine-glass of Santa Cruz 
rum, and a large teaspoonful of powdered sugar. Fill the glass 
with rich milk and shake it until the ingredients are thoroughly 
mixed. Strain into another glass, grate a little nutmeg on the 
top, and serve. This may be made by using a wine-glass of 
either of the above liquors instead of both combined. 

Egg Wine 

Break a nice fresh egg into a tumbler and beat it until it is 
smooth and thick. Add a tablespoon of pulverized sugar and 
stir in a glass of the best Port wine. This is very strengthening 
for an invalid to take about the hour of noon, if the physician 
permits it. When wine is not allowed, a glass of new milk may 
be used instead. 

Gin Rickey 

Put two lumps of ice in a tall glass, add the juice of half a 
lime, the desired amount of gin, and then fill the glass with cold 
seltzer water. 

Gum Syrup 

Boil one generous pound of loaf sugar with one pint of 
water for five minutes, then add enough hot water to make it 
up to one quart. Bottle and use when needed. 

High Ball 
Put some cracked ice in a tall glass, add a half or full whis- 
key glass of Scotch whiskey. Fill the glass with seltzer. Twist 
a small piece of lemon rind in and serve at once. 



BEVERAGES 401 

Hot Scotch 

Rub five lumps of sugar over the outside of a fresh lemon so 
that all the oil is absorbed. Place these in an earthen pitcher 
and add five Sherry glasses of the best Scotch whiskey. Light 
this and stir continually until it burns out. Add seven glasses 
of boiling water and serve at once. 

Lemonade 

The juice of twelve large lemons, thirty lumps of sugar 
thoroughly dissolved in a little water, and three quarts of water. 
Pour all in a pitcher with plenty of ice. This will serve ten or 
twelve people. 

Soda Lemonade 

Dissolve eight lumps of sugar in a little water and add the 
juice of three lemons. Pour into a glass pitcher over ice and 
add two bottles of club soda which is thoroughly chilled and 
one large lemon sliced thin. This will be enough for three 
persons. 

Apollinaris Lemonade 

Make Apollinaris lemonade the same way, substituting one 
and one-half pints of Apollinaris in place of soda water. 

Mint Julep 
Put one-half teaspoonful of orange bitters in a large glass 
with three sprigs of mint. Crush the mint in the bitters and 
then add one Sherry glass of Italian vermouth and one Sherry 
glass of rye whiskey. Fill the glass about one-quarter full of 
finely shaved ice, stir a little, then fill the glass with fine ice. 
Add a few thin slices of orange and pineapple, a few straw- 
berries, and two or three sprigs of mint. Insert two straws and 
serve. Handle the glass carefully so as not to destroy the 
frosting on the outside of the glass.

402 MBS. seely's cook book 

Mint Julep 
Strip tender leaves of mint into a tumbler and add to them 
as much wine, brandy, or other spirit as you wish to use. Put 
pounded ice into a second tumbler, pour over it the mint and 
wine, and continue to pour the mixture from one tumbler to the 
other until it is flavored with the mint to your taste. The oily 
flavor of the mint is extracted by the particles of ice striking 
the leaves as they pass from one tumbler to the other. Finally 
pack the glass with the julep in a large glass with pounded ice. 
Serve with care not to destroy the frost work on the glass. 

Alexandra Punch 
Pour one generous pint of boiling water over four teaspoon- 
fuls of Oolong tea. Let it stand five minutes, then strain. 
When it is cold, add the juice of two oranges, two lemons, one 
spare pint of brandy, two Sherry glasses of green Chartreuse, 
and one quart Jamaica rum. Sweeten to taste and strain. 
Place a large lump of ice in a bowl and pour the mixture over 
it. Remove the seeds from two oranges and one lime. Slice 
them thin, add to the above. Lastly, pour in one quart of 
Champagne and serve at once. 

Champagne Punch 

Three teaspoonfuls of tea steeped five minutes in one pint 
of boiling water. Strain and stand away to cool. When cold, 
add one sliced orange, which has been peeled, six lumps of loaf 
sugar, five thin slices of pineapple, two liqueur glasses of brandy, 
two of maraschino, and two of Medford rum. Mix, and then 
add one quart of Champagne, one bottle of plain cold soda, and 
one-half pint Rhine wine. Pour in a punch bowl and serve at 
once. 

Fruit Punch 

Three scant Sherry glasses of curagoa, the juice of three 
large lemons, one pint of fruit crushed with a little sugar, and 



BEVERAGES 403 

half a pint of brandy. Use either peaches or red raspberries 
with the above. Mix, and add two and one-half pints of claret. 
Sweeten to taste. Strain through a bag made of flannel and 
then add a quart and a half of Champagne and one pint of 
Apollinaris. If you cannot get the fresh fruit, you may substi- 
tute fruit syrups. Do not use sugar, should you use the syrup. 

Mexican Punch 
Mix one quart of Madeira, one pint of brandy, two Sherry 
glasses of Jamaica rum, one pint of Port wine, and the juice of 
six lemons. Peel and remove the seeds of eight oranges, slice 
them in the mixture, and sweeten to taste. Pour in a covered 
vessel (not metal) and set away in a cool place for four days. 
Three-quarters of an hour before using strain and pour into a 
punch bowl in which there is a big piece of ice. Add two 
quarts of Champagne just before serving. 

Milk Punch 
Put two small lumps of ice in a large glass and add one 
teaspoonful of fine white sugar, one wine-glass of brandy, and 
one-half wine-glass of Santa Cruz rum. Fill the glass with rich 
milk, shake it, and then strain into another glass. Grate a 
little nutmeg in the milk and serve. 

Roman Punch 
The ingredients are four quarts of Jamaica rum, three 
quarts of water, five pints of boiling milk, three pounds of loaf 
sugar, twenty-four lemons, and two nutmegs. Cut only the 
yellow of the lemons in thin slices. Let these and the nutmegs 
infuse for twenty-four hours in a warm place in one quart of 
the rum. Put into a large vessel the water, sugar, rum, and 
the rum the lemon has been in, and also the juice of the lemons. 
When the sugar is dissolved, add the milk boiling. It will 
curdle. Cover, and let the mixture stand one hour, and then 
filter it through a flannel bag till it is bright and clear as crystal. 



404 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

This amount will fill one dozen quart bottles. It is better with 
age. A tablespoon of it over lemon ice makes a delicious dish. 

Whiskey Punch 
Have a good-sized pitcher with two large pieces of ice in it. 
Pour in one pint of good whiskey, Bourbon, and the juice of 
four lemons. Stir the mixture thoroughly with a spoon and 
then add two bottles of ginger ale — Cantrells' is the best — 
and six teaspoons of granulated sugar. 

Root Beer 

This wholesome drink, which was made every spring in the 
households of our American forbears, is delicious as well as 
healthful, and it is a pity that the use of genuine root beer is 
dying out. The sarsaparilla, yellow dock, dandelion, burdock, 
and hops used for its making were all products of the near-by 
woods and fields. Bark of the wild cherry was sometimes put 
in, birch bark also, and elecampane, and the aromatic spikenard. 
In springtime children went out with trowel and basket, and 
their intimate knowledge of the growths about them helped to 
their brewing. 

The roots should be all thoroughly washed and then bruised. 
To two gallons of water take an ounce each of the ingredients. 
Put the roots in the cold water and set them over the fire so 
that the heating will draw all the essences and flavors of the 
growths. Let them steep about half an hour and then strain. 
Add a pound of sugar and about twenty-five drops of the oil of 
sassafras or spruce, and, when the brew is cool enough not to 
kill the yeast, add say six or eight tablespoons to the above 
quantity of water, or a dry yeast-cake or two dissolved in a 
little tepid water. Stir the yeast in well and set the brew away 
in an earthen jar and give it some hours to work. After three 
or four hours it may be bottled or kept in the jar for immediate 
drinking without bottling. 



BEVEBAGE8 405 

Currant Shrub 

Add a pound of sugar to a pint of strained currant juice. 
Boil the sugar and juice gently together in a porcelain kettle, 
and, after boiling eight or ten minutes, set it where it will cool. 
When lukewarm, add a wine-glass of French brandy to every 
pint of syrup. Bottle, cork tight, and keep in a cool place. 

Lemon Shrub 

To a pint of the juice of fine fresh lemons put a pound of 
sugar. Measure out for each pint of the syrup three tablespoons 
of French brandy, and soak the thin rind of the lemons in it. 
Let the whole remain a day, stirring up the lemon juice and 
sugar frequently. The next day turn off the syrup and mix it 
with the brandy and lemon rinds. Put in clean bottles, cork 
and seal tight, and keep in a cool place. 

Raspberry Shrub 

To three quarts of fresh ripe raspberries put one quart of 
good vinegar. Let them remain together in a porcelain dish for 
a day, strain and boil and put to each pint of juice a pound of 
white sugar. Boil the whole together for half an hour and 
skim it clear. When cool, add a wine-glass of French brandy 
to each pint of the shrub. 

A couple of tablespoons of this mixed with a tumbler two- 
thirds full of water is a wholesome and refreshing drink in 
fevers. 

Raspberry Shrub 

Pour one quart of vinegar over six quarts of red raspberries 
and let it stand twenty-four hours. Strain and add one pound 
of granulated sugar to one pint of juice. Scald twenty minutes. 
Bottle and cork tightly.

Strawberry Vinegar 
Place the strawberries without water in a preserving kettle, 
let them heat until the juice is well drawn, and add sugar to 
make very sweet. Boil ten or fifteen minutes until rich, then 
add vinegar enough to taste a trifle acid. 

Raspberry "Vinegar 
Is made in the same way. 

Sherry Cobbler 

Put in a glass five scant tablespoons of Sherry with a half a 
tablespoon of powdered sugar, one thin slice of lemon, and two 
thin slices of orange, and fill scantily with crushed ice. Place 
the shaker over the glass and shake it hard. Garnish with any 
small fruits in season. Candied cherries may be used if fresh 
fruits are not at hand. Serve with two straws. Any still wine 
may be used if preferred to Sherry. 

Stone Pence 
Pour one wine-glass of Bourbon or rye whiskey in a large 
bar glass, add two or three small lumps of ice, and fill the glass 
with sweet cider. 

Tea 
First scald the teapot and then allow one teaspoonful of tea 
for each cup of boiling water, and an extra one for the pot. 
Let stand for a few minutes and then serve. English breakfast 
tea should stand at least five minutes before it is served. 

Russian Tea 
Pour just enough boiling water over three generous table- 
spoons of English breakfast tea to cover it. Let it stand a 
minute, then draw the water off. Pour in half a pony of 
Jamaica rum and three pints of boiling water. Leave it to

Beat together to a perfect froth four eggs, six large table- 
spoons of pulverized sugar, and six wine-glasses of St. Croix 
rum, and one pint of boiling water. Have ready two pitchers, 
both heated, and turn the mixture back and forth from one 
pitcher to another. Serve in hot glasses, having grated nut- 
meg over each glassful and drink at once. 

Whips 
One quart of cream, half a pint of wine, half a pound of 
sugar, the whites of three eggs, and the grated rind and juice 
of one lemon. 

Whips 

Take a pint of rather thin cream, add sugar to make it quite 
sweet, then a large wine-glass of wine and a tablespoon of the 
extract of lemon. Let this stand in a cool place while you are 
beating to a stiff froth the whites of three or four eggs. Add 
this to the cream, stirring rapidly. Serve in large-sized wine- 
glasses. 

Innocent Wine 

Pick from their stalks fine grapes of either the Concord, 
Diana, Delaware, or Muscatel variety. Lay them in a strong 
straining cloth in an earthen dish or jar, and bruise or break 
them, with a wooden masher preferable. Hang them in the 
cloth to drain and squeeze out all the juice, which will carry 
with it a portion of the colored tissue lying next the skin and 
holding the delicious aroma of the grape. Stir in liquid 
sugar to sweeten it. Have especial care that you do not get it 
too sweet — that is a fault of inexperienced cooks and of the 
untried palate. Melt the sugar thin with fresh cold water. In 
adding the water use judgment, the proportion is sometimes a

third part of water. Set the mixture on ice and serve ice-cold 
in a glass pitcher containing ice. 

This is a wholesome and delicious afternoon-tea drink taken 
with biscuit slightly sweetened. 

Mulled Wine 

To a pint of water add a teaspoon of powdered cloves and 
cinnamon and set where it will boil. Beat the yolks of three 
eggs with a teaspoon of powdered sugar, and as soon as the 
water boils turn it on the yolks and sugar. Add a pint of wine 
and stir in the beaten whites of the eggs. Serve hot. 

Wine Whey 
Set on the fire in a porcelain saucepan a pint of milk. When 
it boils, pour in as much white wine as will turn it to curds. 
Boil it up, let the curds settle, strain off, add a little boiling 
water, and sweeten to taste.

" After a careful review, I gladly give my hearty indorsement of the work and 
think it would be of inestimable value in all school kitchens. The various subjects 
are taken up in so systematic a manner, the whole so simply treated and facts care- 
fully explained, that it might be used by the youngest pupils."

"This is an admirable analysis of the difficulties, advantages, and disadvantages 
of domestic service, with illustrations and statistics drawn from a careful investiga- 
tion by the author and from government reports. The book should be carefully 
studied by all who believe that the family is the primary agency for social reform 
and progress, and that public health and happiness wait for the advancement of the 
industrial methods." — The Dial (Chicago).

RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 



PART I 

RiaHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 



^>Kc 



CHAPTER I 

GENERAL RELATIONS OF EMPLOYERS AND SERVANTS IN 
THE HOME AND BEFORE THE LAW 

Before the law of this country servants of various kinds 
stand upon the same footing. The term of service is to be 
determined by the agreement between employer and employee, 
between master and man, between mistress and maid. The 
usual engagement is for a week's trial ; if both are suited, the 
arrangement is to go on by the month. If the contract is for a 
term longer than a year, it should be put in writing or it will be 
invalid. 

Importance of Clear Understanding between Employer and 
Employed at the Time of Engagement 

A clear understanding between master and servant at the 
time of the engagement is most important. 

A servant has a right to ask questions about the place in a 
respectful manner, and he should gain all the information he 
legitimately can about the character and demands of the house- 
hold to which he thinks of going. Masters cannot expect 
efficient servants to be indifferent to the duties they are under- 
taking, and to their surroundings while performing those duties. 

3 



4 MBS, SEELTS COOK BOOK 

A servant should tell what he or she expects as a part of his 
place — to help and not to hinder him in the performance of his 
duties. For instance, a lady's maid has a right to a sewing 
room, and a valet to a room where he may press his master's 
clothes, free from the possible interference of other servants. In 
arranging for a place and its duties these matters should all be 
forecast, considered, and definitely settled. 

But a servant should not have a right to dictate what he or 
she will or will not do. The employer has the right of naming 
duties. Servants are at liberty to accept them or not, as they 
wish. 

Liability of a Servant to discharge under Differing 
Circumstances 

The servant may be lawfully discharged before the expira- 
tion of his or her term for immoral conduct, wilful disobedience 
of orders, gross incompetence to perform his duty, etc. Intoxi- 
cation, for example, is a sufficient cause for dismissal. In such 
cases the servant is paid wages for the period he or she has 
served, and not for the entire month. 

If the servant is discharged unjustly, and without sufficient 
cause, before the expiration of his or her term, he or she is 
entitled to a week's or a month's wages. In other words, if a 
master or mistress, without just cause, discharges a servant 
before his or her month expires, the servant is entitled to wages 
in full for the week or month, as the arrangement for service 
and wages may be. If, on the other hand, an emplo3^er has 
occasion to speak to a servant for neglect of duty, and the ser- 
vant says he or she will leave at once, the employer has a perfect 
right to withhold all wages for the week or month. A servant 
should give the employer proper notice before leaving. If the 
servant is employed by the month, at least one week's notice 
is necessary, and if by the week, not less than two or three 
days'. 



BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 5 

If a servant leaves without proper notice and before his 
month expires, unless through sickness or because of some acci- 
dent, he forfeits his wages for the month. 

Wages which may be claimed in Case of Abrupt Dismissal 
or Voluntary Leaving 

If a servant employed in a family hears of another situation 
and, without the employer's consent, leaves at once, or on the 
following day, he or she forfeits claim to wages of his or her 
week or month. In many cases servants are influenced by 
friends in such precipitate action, and should realize they do an 
injustice to themselves as well as to their employer. 

An employer may engage a servant on one week's trial and, 
at the end of the week, both may be satisfied. But if later, per- 
haps in the second or third week, the servant becomes careless, 
neglects duties, and when reproved replies impertinently, the 
employer may discharge him or her with wages to date. 

The Question of References 

As a general rule a master is not obliged to give a reference, 
and statements in regard to the character of servants, to those 
who intend to employ them, are generally regarded as privileged 
communications. In other words, a master or mistress is not 
bound to give a servant a character or letter of recommendation. 
If such is given, it should be truthful. If the servant is not a 
good one, care must be used in the wording of the reference. 

Penalty for forging a Reference by Self or Proxy 

A reference made by a person with malicious intent and con- 
taining false statements calculated to injure and harm the servant 
would be libelous and not privileged. 

A servant obtaining employment by any false or forged letter 
or certificate of recommendation is guilty of a misdemeanor. A 



6 MES. seelt's cook book 

misdemeanor is punishable by imprisonment in a penitentiary, 
or county jail, for not more than one year, or by a fine of not 
more than $500, or by both. 

Penalty for personating" an Employer 

Any individual who personates a master or mistress and 
gives a servant a character is liable to punishment. A servant 
altering a written character, or offering a false one from a pei*son 
representing a master or mistress, is also liable. 

Right to Pare to Place of Engagement 

If servants are going a distance, it should be understood 
that if they leave before the master is ready to return, they must 
pay their own fare back. If the servant remains during the 
period for which he or she is engaged, his fare is paid both ways. 

Heads of a House must indorse Management 

The heads of a household must indorse any one to whom 
they depute the management of their establishment. Too much 
stress cannot be laid upon this necessity. The responsibilities 
of the housekeeper rest heavily upon her, and the heads of the 
house should never give ear to the complaint of a disaffected or 
malicious servant. Such reports should always be sent to the 
one whom they chiefly concern. 

For the heads of the house to listen is to give credence at 
least in part, to disintegrate authority, and to take it from hands 
in which it is frankly placed. It is the beginning of disorder. 
And in housekeeping order is a first law. 

To guard Exactions of Servants, One of Another 

The exactions of servants toward one another is another 
point which should be carefully guarded against. In any group 
of persons, even if there are only three or four, there is com- 



BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 7 

monly some more dominating and masterful — not to say lazy 
— character than the others. Mistress or housekeeper should 
guard carefully the more yielding and kindlier dispositions, and 
see that they are not put upon by their colleagues. Such a 
domestic as " the man of all work" is especially apt to be loaded 
with duties by other servants unless he is protected. 



CHAPTER II 

GENERALLY RECOGNIZED DUTIES 

Duties of Housekeeper 

A MANAGING housekeeper should be possessed of thorough 
executive ability. Necessarily she is well bred and well 
educated. To her duties she often in our country brings a 
knowledge of refined housekeeping gained in her own home, a 
knowledge of life and its conventions, and the tact to direct 
those serving her which is commonly given alone to those bred 
in early years to gentle living. 

She is, under the mistress, head of the house. She hires and 
discharges all servants. She sees personally that all work is 
thoroughly and properly done. She is, with constant kindness 
in her heart for human frailty, on the watch to detect and 
correct any wrongdoing on the part of any servant. She 
should never spy, never go quietly to detect errors. Her ap- 
proach should always be known. She should gain the good 
will and affection of those she directs by unfailing good order 
and kindly interest in each of them. Let her have few 
rules, but those few most effectively kept. If she has the con- 
fidence and respect of those under her, she has their support. 
The heads of the house must fully indorse her in every detail 
of her administration. 

The housekeeper is sometimes also secretary to the mistress 
of the house. But at all times she takes entire charge of the 
house ; in fact, is what her name denotes, — a keeper of the 
house. 

She oversees the closing of the town house and the opening

HOUSEKEEPER 



EIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 9 

of the country house, she sees that all carpets are sent to be 
cleaned, that all blankets are put away in good order, that heavy 
curtains are taken down, and the furniture slip-covers put on 
early in May. She sends lace curtains to the cleaner's. She 
keeps her eyes open for any defects that might damage the 
property of the householders and reports the need of all repairs 
to the mistress. 

Her day is commonly spent in some such wise as this : 
She should be up early in the morning and see that all under her 
charge are at work by seven. She has planned their daily work 
and must see that her directions are carried out with clocklike 
regularity. Her first duty is to go through the servants' rooms 
and see that all beds and windows have been left open by the 
occupants for sweetening and freshening in the morning air. 
Her breakfast, which is commonly served about eight, is brought 
by the second chambermaid and is served in her own sitting 
room or office. In some large households the children of the 
family eat at the housekeeper's table, which is served by a 
footman. 

After breakfast the housekeeper goes to the pantry to see 
what is wanted in the way of supplies — such as brushes, 
sponges, towels, soap, chamois, and other articles used for clean- 
ing and washing. If glass or china has been broken, it should 
be reported to her at once. Plenty of towels are needed in the 
pantry, and those of good quality are cheaper in the end. Fine 
glass and silver require soft linen. If the towels furnished are 
too coarse, the men will be driven to use the expensive table 
napkins for their polishing. 

It is well for the housekeeper to look through all drawers and 
closets in the pantry, and also into the ice-box, to see that all 
things are kept clean and that no stale fruit or food is by 
chance left behind. If servants see that the housekeeper is 
interested in keeping all such places in order, they themselves 
are more neat and careful. 



10 MRS. SEELY'S cook BOOK 

In smaller establishments the housekeeper now makes up 
her lists for the grocer and her menus for lunch and dinner. 
When these have been examined by the mistress of the house, 
she goes to market and sends in all that is necessary for the 
day's meals. She then returns home to see that what she has 
ordered lias been sent. In larger establishments she first pays 
her regular visit to the kitchen, at which time the chef, or 
cook, asks for anything needed other than the marketing. In 
such establishments the menu arranged by the chef or cook 
is approved by the mistress of the house, or if not by her, then 
by the housekeeper. 

The same duty and the unswerving vigilance with which 
she began the day lead her to go through all rooms of the 
house, to be sure that her aids have done their work properly. 
She sees that the bath-rooms are in perfect order, the bath-tubs 
clean, soap-dishes and racks wiped, glasses on the basin in 
order, and all waterclosets scoured and flushed. If guests are 
expected, she helps to welcome them to the house by seeing 
that towels are in plenty, fresh soap is in the dish, fresh ink 
in the inkstand, fresh pen in the holder, and that stationery is 
at hand, and the pin-cushion well supplied with pins. Candles 
and matches on the stand by the bedside, whether in a house 
where electric lights are used or not, do not miss her over- 
sight. She sees to it also that the drawers of closet and 
bureau are empty, and that, if sachets are not supplied, smooth 
white paper is spread in them. 

After luncheon there is often at times a little mending need- 
ful in the table linen, and this mending sometimes falls to the 
housekeeper. It should be done before sending away to the 
laundry. A linen book is well kept in the pantry. In this 
book the pantry maid should make a list of all table linen 
before it is sent to the wash. This linen, as well as all other 
soiled linen, should be taken to the laundry Friday afternoons, 
so that the laundress may sort it for washing Saturday. The 




ft s 





BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 11 

housekeeper checks off the linen when it comes from the laundry, 
and directs the putting away of it. A well-trained housemaid 
may assist, but the housekeeper herself should look after it 
personally. 

The housekeeper has charge of the linen closet, and sees that 
the supply is increased when necessary. It is she also in many 
houses who gives out the daily supply of linen, orders the 
flowers, and sees that they are properly arranged by the butler. 
In fact, the housekeeper often gives the butler a helping hand 
with the flowers, especially when no parlor maid is kept and 
the butler and second man have charge of the parlors. The 
housekeeper orders all coal, wood, etc., and in some houses she 
has entire charge of the wine closet, giving out daily to the 
butler the wines he requires, and handing to the mistress a 
weekly list of the contents of the wine closet. 

In the evening the housekeeper usually makes up the 
accounts and goes over the books of the different tradespeople, 
for she pays all bills and sees that in items and as a whole they 
are correct. 

Duties of Lady's Maid 

A lady's maid should be a well-mannered, respectable-look- 
ing young woman. She should be a tolerably good dressmaker 
and a good hairdresser. 

Her first morning duty is to dress her mistress. About this 
it is impossible to give directions, since ladies differ much in 
their toilet arrangements. The housemaid generally takes up 
the hot water for the mistress. Occasionally the mistress pre- 
fers to have her own maid do so. 

The maid draws her mistress's bath, and after the latter has 
bathed and is dressed, the maid must examine her wardrobe, 
put away everything left about the room, and shake or iron 
out tumbled dresses. She then sits in the sewing room, but 
must be in readiness to answer her mistress's bell, and to dress 



12 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

her for a walk, drive, or ride, having everything ready and 
boots, gloves, etc., in perfect order. 

During the day, when not in actual attendance, she will 
have to mend and probably to wash and iron fine lace, hand- 
kerchiefs, etc. Very little instruction can be given on this 
point. Different mistresses have different needs and make 
different demands upon maids. Brushes should be washed in 
tepid water to which a little ammonia is added, care being 
taken not to wet the back of the brush. The bristles should 
be rinsed thoroughly and dried, if possible, in the open air. 

Once a week the lady's maid will have to send her mistress's 
linen to the wash. She should look over the clothes and mend 
everything that requires a stitch before sending it, making also 
two lists, one in a book for the laundress and one in a book to 
be kept at home. When the clothes return from the wash, the 
maid should compare them with the list, examine the marks to 
see that they have not been changed, sew on any buttons, and 
set aside any badly washed or ironed garments. 

For the dinner toilet she should have everything prepared 
and at hand. As soon as the toilet is made and her mistress 
has left the room, she should examine the dress just removed, 
brush it if it is a tweed, shake and wipe it if it is a silk or any 
light material. Silk dresses should be wiped with a soft piece 
of merino or very fine flannel. If anything needs mending, it 
should be done at once. Everything should be aired, cleaned, 
and put away — either folded or hung in the wardrobe. 

The mistress's bedroom must be ready for her at the usual 
hour of her retiring for the night. It is the maid's duty to 
undress her mistress, and remain in attendance until she is 
dismissed. 

A respectful manner is necessary in a lady's maid. She is 
not to keep her seat while her mistress is speaking to her, unless 
she is asked to, and she is to rise when her mistress enters the 
room. 



RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SEKVANTS 13 

A good deal of sitting up at night is sometimes required 
from a lady's maid. She must strive to get what rest she 
can, and good-temperedly support any inevitable fatigue. A 
cheerful, kindly performance of her duties, and deference, obe- 
dience, industry, and strict honesty will be apt to secure for her 
a friend in her mistress and a happy home under all ordinary 
circumstances. 

A sewing room should be set aside for the use of the lady's 
maid. 

Duties of Valet 

The valet's duty is to wait upon his master. In the morn- 
ing he attends to the lighting of the fire and warming of his 
master's bedroom. He then cleans his boots and shoes, and 
brushes his clothing, which he arranges on a table or chair. 
He prepares the master's bath, and if it is wished, hands gar- 
ments to him as he dresses. He is sometimes expected to 
shave his master. Later he puts the dressing room in order, 
brushes clothes before putting them away, cleans combs and 
brushes, and is at his master's orders whenever required. 

Valeting is often done by the butler and footmen or second 
men. The latter take turns in valeting guests. 

There should be a room set aside for the valet in which to 
press, brush, and care for his master's clothes. If a specific 
room for this use is impossible, he must do the best he can in 
the laundry or the front basement. 

Duties of Butler 

The butler has entire charge of the dining room and of the 
under menservants or footmen. Both he and his men should 
be at work by seven in the morning. The butler puts the din- 
ing room in order, sets the table, and then has his own break- 
fast at seven-thirty in the servants' hall. When three or more 
men are kept, he serves his master's breakfast and takes his 
orders for the day. He sees to setting of trays for any break- 



RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 15 

to call his attention to his work and himself. In houses where 
no housekeeper is employed he has the table linen in his care, 
takes out daily what he requires, and counts it before sending 
to the laundry. 

A butler wears at breakfast, and also at luncheon, a high 
double-breasted black waistcoat (not a low-cut evening one), 
trousers of any mixed pepper-and-salt description, never black, 
a black tie, and a black dress coat. In the evening he wears all 
black, with a low cut waistcoat that may be white if he chooses, 
and a white tie. At dinner he always stands behind his mas- 
ter's chair, and the footman behind his mistress. 

Valeting, especially of guests, is sometimes done by the but- 
ler. He valets the master if required. 

A single-handed butler takes charge of dining room and sil- 
ver, and valets the gentlemen of the house. He also helps more 
or less with the cleaning of the parlor floor. The parlor maid 
assists him at night with the washing of the dinner dishes, and 
also answers the bell while he is cleaning the silver. 

Duties of First Footman 

The first footman lays the table for each meal, serves the 
family breakfast either on trays in the different rooms or in 
the breakfast or dining room, and attends the door during the 
morning. In households where but a butler and one footman are 
kept, the two alternate in tending the door. In other establish- 
ments the first, second, and third footmen take turns at the door, 
each one serving every third day. Families differ in the manage- 
ment of these divisions of household labor, but the above and 
all other duties mentioned apply in a general rule. 

If the first footman does not wait at breakfast, he is busy 
cleaning silver. To keep it in perfect order, silver should be 
rubbed every day and cleaned once a week, and he w411 therefore 
need to do some part every day. The large dining room, where 
there is a breakfast room also, he has to brush before he sets out 



16 MRS. seely's cook book 

the silver on the sideboard. The dining room is thoroughly 
swept every Saturday morning, and of course is in perfect order 
before the family breakfast. If it is used upon the previous day, 
it should be brushed every morning. All sweeping and dusting 
should be finished before breakfast. 

The morning dress of the footman is of a double-breasted 
coat, waistcoat, trousers, and small black tie. At lunch he wears 
his regular livery suit with a striped waistcoat. When the 
family is in mourning, he wears black tie, studs, and cuff-buttons. 
At dinner he wears livery. His livery should always be 
immaculate. 

Each second man or footman should have every second or 
third afternoon from the time lunch work is finished until five 
o'clock. 

Duties of Second and Third Pootman 

The second footman has care of the breakfast room, waits at 
breakfast with the butler, helps with trays, leathers the small 
silver, and helps wipe dishes. 

The third footman has care of the front hall and library; 
also of coat-room. He dusts every morning and sweeps the 
halls thoroughly Saturday mornings and the library on Thurs- 
days. He serves breakfast to the housekeeper and children's 
table if there be one, and with his fellow-footmen takes turns at 
serving lunch at this table. He is dressed in livery at ten 
o'clock and in the hall to answer bells, etc. 

Valeting is done by footmen. They take turns in valeting 
guests. 

The Duties of Second Man when Three Men (a Butler and 
Useful Man) are kept 

To be at work at 7 a.m. ; sweep and dust the front hall and 
vestibule and to breakfast at seven-thirty. To carry up all 
trays with breakfasts to those having breakfast in their rooms.

the hose. Shakes door-mats. Helps sweep bedrooms when 
such are very large and the furniture heavy, carries all hampers

walk and area. He cleans the front door-knobs, washes up in 
the pantry, assists waitress in cleaning dining room and parlor 
floors and windows, attends front door and carries coal, wood, etc. 

Duties of Waitress 

The duties of waitress are those which fall to a butler, where 
one is kept. She has entire charge of the dining room and 



18 MRS. SEELY's cook BOOK 

pantry, cleans silver and takes charge of the cooling and warm- 
ing of wines, and serves all meals, assisted by the parlor maid. 
She serves any refreshment required in the evening, carries 
coffee after dinner to the parlor — in fact, her duties are those 
of a butler. 

She must always have on her black dress, white apron and 
cap before lunch is served. She takes turns with the parlor 
maid at answering front door-bell and seeing that all windows 
and doors on the parlor floor are fastened for the night. She 
puts out all gas, lamps, etc. 

In some houses she combines with her own work the duties 
of a parlor maid. In such arrangements she is expected to rise 
at six or six-thirty at the latest, open the parlor floor, and brush 
up and dust the dining room before breakfast. After breakfast 
she washes china, glass, and silver and puts the dining room in 
order. She also has charge of and keeps clean the hall, library, 
and entire parlor floor, and she cleans brass and the front door- 
knobs. 

Duties of Parlor Maid 

In smaller establishments the parlor maid is at work at six- 
thirty. She opens up the lower rooms, sweeps and dusts the 
halls and parlors, brushes the overcoat and hat required by the 
master and lays out his gloves. On the day the waitress cleans 
the silver the parlor maid helps her wash dishes in the pantry 
and helps generally with the silver. She answers the front door- 
bell. She assists at luncheon when there are guests, and always 
at dinner. She keeps her parlors in good order, attends to the 
flowers, lights the gas and lamps, sees that the morning and

washing of glass, china, and silver. She serves breakfast and 
waits on the door. 





-— t^^' 




BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 19 

When two or more men are kept, her work varies. She has 
the drawing, reception and sitting rooms, main stairs and lava- 
tories on the parlor floor to dust every morning. When the 
drawing room and sitting rooms are thoroughly swept the sec- 
ond footman or useful man should help, because the furniture is 
too heavy for a woman to lift. If they begin the work at six in 
the morning, their assisting does not interfere with the pantry 
work. 

The parlor maid washes dishes and keeps clean the drawers, 
closets, and refrigerators of the pantry. The cleaning of brass 
in the pantry is done by one of the pantry men. She should 
see that towels are in abundance and are washed every day. 
She sweeps and puts the pantry in order every day, and washes 
it up once or twice a week. 

Her dress is the same as that of the chambermaid. 

Duties of Chambermaid 

She should commence sweeping halls at six-thirty. After 
breakfast she dusts halls, draws baths, calls the family or visi- 
tors, and opens up shutters in bedrooms. She also assists the 
lady's maid in brushing the dresses. 

After the family have gone to breakfast, she opens their bed- 
room windows, takes clothes off the beds, one by one, placing 
them across two chairs to air, and turns the mattress across the 
foot of the bed to air. She then puts away any clothing, dress- 
ing-gowns, slippers, etc., washes out soap-dishes and other toilet 
articles, going through each bedroom in her care, and opening 
up each bed to air in each room. She then commences to make, 
at the first she opened for refreshing. Every day she should 
sweep up pieces and thoroughly dust not only the furniture but 
woodwork of the room. Once a week every room should be 
thoroughly swept, and plumbing fixtures and silver toilet arti- 
cles cleaned. One room a day should be done in this manner, 
the useful man cleaning the windows and brasses, and, on a lad- 



20 MRS, seely's cook book 

der, wiping over tops of doors, pictures, etc. All work should 
be finished in the bedrooms before lunch. If there is not time 
to accomplish all before lunch, then she cleans the silver articles 
after, and brings them back to their places. 

One chambermaid is expected to assist in the pantry the 
nights of dinner parties, and, where two chambermaids are kept, 
they take evenings about. When dusk comes, the chambermaid 
draws down the shades and lights the gas. Where there are 
open fireplaces, she builds up a bright fire. If guests are stay- 
ing in the house, she sees that they have everything they re- 
quire. After the family and guests go to dinner she removes 
and carefully folds the lace spreads, etc., of the beds. She then 
turns the bed down nicely and lays the nightgown on it. 
Dressing-gowns and slippers are placed on or by chairs. She 
removes soiled towels and puts out fresh ones, tidies wash- 
stand, lowers gas, and sees that drinking water is put in all bed- 
rooms not later than nine o'clock in winter ; ten will do in sum- 
mer. If gentlemen are staying in the house, and have no valet 
with them, the chambermaid in charge of their rooms either 
herself (or sees that the useful man) puts out the evening suit, 
a clean shirt with studs, etc., and, after the guest has gone to 
dinner, that the suit of clothes and boots he has worn through 
the day are taken away, cleaned and brought back ready for the 
next morning. 

One of the first things for a chambermaid to learn is how 
properly to make a bed. Every bed which has been occupied 
should, to preserve the health of its occupant and the hygiene 
of the house, be thoroughly aired both in bed-clothes and mat- 
tress every time it is used. The first chambermaid has charge 
of all bedrooms and bath-rooms on the second floor and one 
stairway. She also assists in the linen room. 

All beds are changed on Saturday so that the soiled clothes 
can go to the laundry that morning. 

The chambermaid's dress for morning wear should always 



BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 21 

be of light print material, waist and skirt to match. In the 
afternoon she wears waist and skirt of bUxck cashmere or 
serge, white collar and cuffs. She wears cap and apron at 
all times. 

Duties of Second Chambermaid 

The second chambermaid has charge of the bedrooms on the 
third floor and third hall and stairs. These should be taken 
care of with as scrupulous cleanliness and care as any other. If 
on this floor there is a playroom, it should be cleaned and put in 
order before the hall, early in the morning. The chambermaid 
gives this room its first daily cleaning. The nurses keep it in 
order for the day. 

Duties of Third Chambermaid 

The third chambermaid brushes and dusts the sewing room 
early every morning in order not to disturb the ladies' maids 
when they are busy. She has charge of servants' bed- and 
bath-rooms, hall and stairs. Sometimes nurses make their 
own beds ; but the chambermaid does their cleaning in their 
rooms. 

She makes the beds of the men, cooks, kitchen maids and 
laundresses, etc., and sweeps, dusts, and tidies their rooms — 
keeping them in perfect order. 

She keeps the servants' hall in order and cleans silver for its 
table. In fact she takes care of this dining hall, except its 
windows. 

Duties of Laundress 

The laundress should collect all the linen requiring washing 
and compare it with the list given her and then assort it. Linen 
should be washed well in two waters. The first water should 
be cool. The second should be hot and plentiful. Scald, rinse 
in hot water, then in cold water slightly tinged with blue, 



22 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

wring thoroughly, and hang in the sunshine and air to bleach 
and dry. After the articles are ironed and thoroughly aired the 
laundress should fold them neatly and pass them on to the 
housemaid or lady's maid to assort. Handkerchiefs should be 
ironed wet, to stiffen and give them a gloss. 

When the housekeeper pays her regular visit to the laundry, 
the laundress should then tell what she needs to further her 
work. 

Duties of Second Laundress 

She is to rise not later than six-thirty, make the laundry fire 
and put the laundry in order. She washes and irons all the 
plain clothes, and sometimes where the fine wash is very large 
she assists the head laundress in ironing. 

Duties of Cook 

She should be in the kitchen early — by six o'clock — and 
prepare for the servants' breakfast at seven. After breakfast 
she should prepare and send up the family breakfast. Later 
she should tell the housekeeper what is wanted for the day, pre- 
pare pies, puddings, or ices for luncheon and dinner, see that the 
kitchen maid has vegetables and that the meat and pudding are 
attended to for the servants' dinner at twelve-thirty. After 
this dinner she prepares and sends up the family lunch. After 
lunch she sees that all vegetables, game, etc., required for the 
family dinner, are prepared, and makes cake or anything required 
for afternoon tea. She should always have a list of what is re- 
quired from the grocer, etc., ready for the housekeeper, should 
see that the kitchen maid does her work well and is clean, that 
the refrigerator, meat house, etc., are in good order. In fact, 
she takes entire charge of the kitchen under the housekeeper, 
and she should personally supervise the cleaning of the kitchen 
and cooking utensils, ice-boxes, etc. 

The cook, if cooking only is expected and a kitchen maid is 



RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 23 

kept, is supposed to take entire charge of the family cooking. 
She prepares and cooks all game such as canvasback and redhead 
duck, etc., and all entrees. 

If she is privileged to go out alternate Sundays, she should 
have everything prepared and ready for the kitchen maid to 
cook. 

In smaller establishments the cook is expected to clean the 
hall and passage, as well as the kitchen, scullery, etc. When the 
morning's dirty work is done, she should carefully wash her 
hands and visit the larder. Here she should look to everything. 
See if the hanging meat or game requires cooking. Wipe out 
and air the bread-box. Clean and scrub the larder at least 
twice a week. Receive her mistress's orders attentively, and if 
she cannot trust her memory, write them on a slate. She should 
examine the meat sent by the butcher, and if it is not right, re- 
fuse to accept it. She should also weigh the meat and ask the 
butcher for a paper of weight. 

And now a few hints to the cook about kitchen work : — 

Clean up as you go. 

Don't scatter in the kitchen. 

Be sure to put scalding water in each saucepan or stewpan 
as you finish using it. 

Keep your spice-box always replenished, and take care to 
let your mistress know if you are out of anything likely to be 
required, that its place may at once be supplied. 

Take care of your copper utensils that the tin does not be- 
come worn off. If so, have them instantly replaced. 

Dry your saucepans before you put them away. 

Pudding bags and jelly cloths require care ; wash and hang 
them to dry directly after using them. Air them well before 
you put them away or they will smell musty. Keep them in a 
warm, dry place. 

After washing up your dishes and cleaning the dishpan, 
scald out the sink and sink brush. 



24 MRS. seelt's cook book 

Be careful not to throw anything but water down the sink, 
lest you should clog it up. 

Never have sticky, greasy plates and dishes. The way to 
avoid this is to use soap, very hot water, and clean dry towels. 
Change the water often. Perfectly clean plates and dishes are 
one proof of the cook being a good servant. 

Be particular in washing vegetables. Lay cauliflower and 
cabbage in salt and water for an hour or more to get out the 
insects, etc. 

If a dinner party is in prospect, ask for the bill of fare and 
get ready all you can the day before, to ease worry and hurry on 
the day fixed. 

Take notice of all orders that require time in the preparation 
of a dinner and hurry nothing. 

Wear plain cotton dresses and large aprons. 

Be sure to keep your hair neat and smooth. 

Be careful of fuel. It is a great recommendation to a cook 
to use only the necessary amount of coal. 

Have an eye to your mistress's interests, not permitting 
waste of any kind. A cook who is just and honest and does as 
she would be done by is worthy of the greatest respect and may 
be sure of being successful and happy. 

Duties of Chef 

A chef has the entire charge of his kitchen, and, as a rule, 
two assistants, who are called second cook and kitchen maid. 
The chef does all ordering for the kitchen in the way of mar- 
keting. Utensils, etc., are ordered by the housekeeper. He 
makes up the menu, and cooks for the family table, and 
arranges all the meals for the servants' table. 

Duties of Second Cook 

The second cook helps the chef with all cooking for the 
family, and is expected to cook for the servants' table. In

addition to this the second cook makes all hot bread, and 
helps prepare vegetables. She cleans all store-room closets and 
drawers once a week, and supervises ice-boxes. The second 
cook is sometimes called first kitchen maid. 

Duties of Kitchen Maid 

She should be in the kitchen not later than six o'clock ; 
start the cook's fire ; sweep the kitchen and dining hall ; and 
set the table for servants. She puts over the fire oatmeal, — or

and pans ready for the cook. After breakfast is over she 
waslies dishes, and then helps the cook in sending up the 
family breakfast ; she prepares vegetables for the servants' 
dinner, sets the table, and serves the servants' dinner at twelve 
o'clock, waiting upon the table. After dinner she washes the 
dishes, and helps the cook where she needs help for the family 
luncheon. She serves servants' supper or tea at five-thirty, 
washes the dishes, and helps the cook for family dinner, carry- 
ing dishes to the lift as cook has them ready, etc. She washes 
pots and pans and tidies up the kitchen, and before going to

scrubbing kitchen, basement, and stairs. Where only one house- 
maid is kept, she is expected to attend to the servants' bed- 
rooms, back halls, and staircase. 

She generally washes all kitchen towels, roller towels, and 
servants' table linen, and answers the basement bell. 

Duties of Second Kitchen Maid or Scullery Maid 

She washes dishes, prepares vegetables, washes towels, helps 
keep the kitchen clean, cleans refrigerators, etc., and kindles

26 MES, SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Duties of Coachmen and Stablemen in a Large Estab- 
lishment 

An establishment or stable department where all kinds of 
carriages are kept, from a coach to a runabout, differs according 
to the requirements and life of the family to be served. When 
everything is the best of its kind, and every appointment is 
to be perfect, eight men at least, besides the head coachman, 
and twenty horses are required. 

The head coachman should be a man who thoroughly under- 
stands his business in every detail, and one who commands the 
respect of men under him. 

He should have full and complete charge of everything con- 
nected with the stable, be held responsible for its service in every 
way, and have authority to discharge his men for misconduct. 

His duties require him to see the horses fed, and his men at 
work in the morning punctually at the hour set by him. He 
should see that the men do their work properly, he should say 
what horses require exercise, etc., and strictly watch the gen- 
eral health and comfort of the animals. 

To the head coachman falls especially attention to the first 
lady of the household. He sees that all his men are properly 
fitted with the livery required for each style of carriage, and 
that they are at all times clean and neat in person. 

To regulate his work he will need a second coachman, who 
will drive in his turn, see that all carriages are kept perfectly 
clean, pay strict attention to the oiling of wheels, etc., and 
care for general neatness of the coach house. 

A third coachman, or pad groom, will be required to ride 
and drive, and to keep clean saddles and bridles. He also has 
care of the saddle room. 

One man must be appointed harness cleaner, and he will 
have care of all harnesses and the harness room, and see that 
all harnesses are clean and in their place. 



EIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 27 

It will need the time of the other men to clean and harness 
horses, and properly attend to them after they are used ; to 
clean stable drains and stable ; to keep the place free from 
foul odor ; and to dust, wash windows, etc. 

In order to insure the convenience of the family, and to 
prevent the men's being away at meals, etc., it is best to pro- 
vide in such an establishment for the men's board and sleeping 
accommodations, bath, etc., in the stable. 



CHAPTER III 

GENERALLY RECOGNIZED DUTIES IN THE AVERAGE WELL- 
APPOINTED HOUSEHOLD OF SIX SERVANTS. DUTIES OF 
COOK, WAITRESS, PARLOR MAID, CHAMBERMAID, LAUN- 
DRESS, USEFUL MAN. 

Duties of Cook 

The cook rises and is downstairs at six o'clock, and opens 
the door for the furnace or useful man. She makes her fire 
and cleans her range, and cooks and serves at seven o'clock the 
servants' breakfast. After this breakfast she cooks the break- 
fast for the family, which is usually at eight o'clock. While 
the family is at breakfast she washes up her kitchen dishes and 
saucepans, and tidies up her kitchen. Later she puts on a 
clean white apron, and goes to her mistress's room for orders 
for the day. The servants have their lunch at twelve o'clock, 
the family at one. The family dinner is at seven or eight, 
and the servants have theirs afterward. 

The cook has every other Sunday from three o'clock until 
ten-thirty, the laundress cooking the dinner. She has also 
one evening in the week after she cooks and serves her dinner, 
the laundress washing up for her. The cook takes care of her 
own kitchen, ice-boxes, closets, windows, and cellar stairs. 

Duties of Waitress 

The waitress has entire charge of dining room and pantry. 
She cleans the silver, ice-box, china and glass closets, washing 
and caring for her glass and dish towels. She also cares for 
the billiard room. The useful man looks after the grate fire,

the brasses, and windows. The parlor maid assists her at 
dinner every other night, alternating with the chambermaid. 
The Avaitress serves breakfast, luncheon, and dinner. She at- 
tends the front door until the parlor maid is dressed. She 
has every other Sunday afternoon and evening out, and one 
evening in the week, the parlor maid or chambermaid taking 
her place. She is dressed in black dress, white apron, cap, 
collar, and cuffs. 

Duties of Parlor Maid 

The parlor maid is at work at six o'clock. She opens up the 
parlors and sitting room, and dusts and puts in order the rooms 
on that floor. She then takes her breakfast. After breakfast 
she brushes the overcoats and hats, and lays out the gloves 
required by the gentlemen of the house. 

She also waits on the mistress, keeping in order, laying out, 
dusting, and putting away her clothes. She helps the waitress 
at lunch, if there are guests, and always at dinner, taking her 
place every other Sunday afternoon and evening, also one 
evening in the week. She answers the front door-bell the 
day the waitress cleans the silver. 

She is dressed at three o'clock to attend the front door, and 
generally mends, hems dusters and floor-cloths which she uses 
for that floor. She cleans the parlors thoroughly once a 
month, oftener if used very much, but dusts them thoroughly 
every day, taking care of her own broom, brushes, chamois, 
dusters, pails, etc., and washing dusters daily to keep them 
sweet and clean. She draws the shades, lights the gas and 
lamps, sees that the morning and evening papers are ready, 
attends to the flowers, sees that the fires burn brightly, and 
closes up her part of the house. In fact she has the duties 
of a second man. Every other Sunday afternoon and evening 
she has out, and one evening in the week, but she must be 
home at ten- thirty. 



30 MRS. si:ELr's cook book 

Duties of Chambermaid 

The chambermaid rises and is downstairs at six o'clock. 
She sweeps and dusts the halls and stairs, draws baths, calls 
the family or visitors, and has her breakfast. After breakfast 
she goes to the servants' rooms, and after making their beds 
and tidying the rooms, she goes to the family rooms and opens 
bedroom windows, takes clothes off the beds, one by one, placing 
them on two chairs, being careful not to let the clothes touch 
the floor, and turns the mattress across the foot of the bedstead 
to air. She puts away dressing-gowns, slippers, washes out 
soap-dishes, and attends to the toilet articles. She goes through 
each bedroom in her care, opening up beds to air in each room. 
She begins at the first she exposed to the air, and makes the 
others in turn. Every day she sweeps up pieces, and thoroughly 
dusts not only the furniture, but the woodwork of the room. 

Once a week she should thoroughly sweep every bedroom, 
clean globes and bath-room fixtures, and silver toilet articles. 
One room a day should be done, the useful man cleaning the 
windows, brasses, wiping over tops of pictures, windows, doors, 
etc. All work should be finished in the bedrooms before 
luncheon. 

The chambermaid is dressed by four o'clock, in black dress, 
white apron, cap, collar, and cuffs. She does the darning and 
mending, hemming of dusters and floor-cloths. At dusk, she 
draws down the shades, lights the gas or lamps, and where 
there are open fireplaces, builds up a bright fire. If guests are 
staying in the house she sees that they have everything they 
require. After the family and guests go to dinner, she turns 
down the beds and removes and carefully folds the lace spreads, 
etc. The nightgowns are then laid on the bed, and slippers 
are placed on the floor. She removes soiled towels and puts out 
fresh ones, tidies wash-stands, lowers gas, puts ice water in all 
the bedrooms not later than ten o'clock.

BIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SERVANTS 3l 

The chambermaid has every other Sunday afternoon and 
evening off until ten-thirty, the parlor maid or waitress taking

and everything to work with, and must wash her dusters each 
day, taking good care of each article. 

Duties of Laundress 

The laundress rises and is ready for work at six o'clock ; 
she opens the servants' rooms, and takes the clothes off their 
beds, one by one, placing them across two chairs, also she turns 
the mattress across the foot of bedstead to air. She empties 
their slops, leaving the rest for the chambermaid to do. She 
cleans the laundry stove, makes her fire, and by this time her 
breakfast is ready. She also takes care of the front basement 
hall, sweeps, cleans, and dusts it ; does the family laundry 
work ; washes and irons the aprons for waitress, parlor maid, 
and chambermaid. She attends the basement door-bell while

CHAPTER IV 

DUTIES OF SERVANTS UNDER OTHER CONDITIONS. HOUSE- 
HOLD OF TWO SERVANTS 

Duties of Cook and Laundress, Chambermaid and Waitress 

Cook and laundress, chambermaid and waitress, if only two 
servants are kept, should work together, taking each other's 
place alternate on days or nights out. Their duties are stated 
in foregoing pages. If there are three maids and the third be 
a laundress, she should take the cleaning the last of the week 
and relieve the waitress one evening in the week, and also 
help wash up the cook's night off. 

Duties of General House Servant in House or Apartment 

If only one servant is kept, and she is engaged to do the 
entire general work, she does not as a rule expect much time 
off. In many cases she has every second Sunday, and one 
evening in the week, and occasionally two or three hours of 
an afternoon for shopping. In some cases the mistress washes 
the dishes and makes the beds, especially on washing and iron- 
ing days, and on her Sunday afternoon and evening off. But 
no two households are alike. Rules differ very much.

CHAPTER V 
DON'TS FOR EMPLOYER 

Don't engage a servant without having a clear understand- 
ing as to what he or she is expected to do. 

Don't give an order and then forget it, and contradict your- 
self. 

Don't send orders to one servant through another if you 
can avoid it. 

Don't discuss servants in general, or those of any particular 
nationality, while you are being waited on at table. 

Don't promise a holiday, or any pleasure, and then take it 
back. 

Don't spy upon your servants — take pains to be sure they 
are honest, and then trust them rationally. 

Don't expose them to temptation by leaving money care- 
lessly about, as if it had no value for you. 

Don't go into your servants' rooms, unless you have reason to 
think they are not clean, — they have a right to some privacy. 

Don't blame servants for every fault or mistake, and then 
leave good service unthanked. They would rather, being 
human, be scolded and praised than have uniform excellence 
taken for granted. 

Don't expect in your servants a perfection which would be 
impossible in any human being. 

Don't talk of one servant in the hearing of another. Don't 
discuss one servant with another. 

Don't rely on information given you by one servant of the 
other without first investigating. Often ill-feeling and jealousy 
will prompt a false report. 

D 33 



34 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Don't allow the cook to stint the table of the servants. 
They should be well fed. It pays to drop into the kitchen at 
meal time and see if their meals are properly cooked and served. 

Don't fail to see that their beds are good and their rooms 
properly cared for. Give each one a separate room when it is 
possible. 

Don't expect servants to perform duties without proper 
utensils to work with. Have dust sheets, cloths, brooms, 
brushes, pails, chamois, dusters, etc., and require each servant 
to look after his or her own articles. 

Don't neglect to have inventory of china, glass, silver, and 
bric-a-brac of each servant. coming and going. Without this 
it is difficult to keep track of various articles. 

Don't forget the old proverb, which has generations of 
human experience in it : " Like mistress like maid ; like mas- 
ter like man." 

See that each person in your employ, especially when kept 
busy late in the evening, has a time in the day, say of an hour 
or two, when he or she may be alone and rest, or do what he or 
she wishes. 

In arranging a changing off of work, for instance, the 
change about of parlor maid with waitress, when one takes 
some hours off, see that each one clearly understands her duties 
and privileges. This will save misunderstanding, and perhaps 
a complete upsetting of the domestic order. 

The best way to get polite and respectful service is to be 
respectful and polite and self-contained yourself. 



CHAPTER VI 
DON'TS FOR SERVANTS 

Don't decide the minute you enter a new situation that it 
doesn't suit you. Pay no attention to any gossip that may be 
told you. Wait and see for yourself. By so doing you will 
avoid unnecessary trouble for self as well as your employer. 

Don't tell an untruth about your wages. Tell what amount 
you have received a month when asked by an employer. False- 
hood will place you in a very bad position. It is sure to be 
found out. 

Don't be foolish in regard to wearing a cap. It is a great 
improvement to one's appearance, and is worn by all first-class 
servants. Be sure to keep the hair tidy. 

Don't listen while you are waiting at table — you will prob- 
ably get things twisted and be tempted to repeat them so. 

Don't be always standing on your dignity as to what is and 
is not " your place " — if you cannot get along go away, but 
while you are in a house be pleasant. 

Don't hide breakage from your mistress, — it will get you 
into more trouble in the end than if you acknowledge the acci- 
dent at once. 

Don't think your mistress is unbearable because she may 
sometimes be a little short in her manner, — ladies often have 
worries and responsibilities of which servants have no idea. 

Don't spend your time comparing the ways of one mistress 
with those of another — each one has a right to her own rules 
in her own house. 

Don't spy on your masters and mistresses — the fact that their 
bread is in your mouth should be a reason for keeping it shut. 

35 



36 MRS. seely's cook book 

Don't go through your work mechanically — try to notice 
how people leave things themselves, and put them in that order. 

Don't " arrange " the papers on a desk or writing table 
unless expressly told to ; pick them up, dust them, and where 
they have lain, and put them down in the same place. 

Don't be restless and want to move too often — the longer 
you stay in one place the more likely you are to get a good 
wedding present or legacy. 

Don't, when September comes, be influenced by city friends 
and give up a good home on account of your employer's remain- 
ing in the country until October or November. Girls often do 
this, and it is a great mistake. They are apt to remain idle 
two or three weeks, and then are often compelled again to go 
out of town and amongst strangers. 

Don't leave garbage in the pantry from one meal to another. 
Always keep the sink and pantry clean. 

Don't upset the cook by telling her what the family say 
about her cooking. Leave that for the mistress. If there is 
any fault to be found it is not so apt to cause trouble if it goes 
direct to the cook from her mistress. 

Don't forget when meats, turkey, and game are served, that 
sauce or gravy, also the jelly, such as cranberry jelly, etc., 
should be served before the vegetables. 

Don't, when you are cleaning rooms, forget your dusters, 
broom, and other articles. Look around before you leave the 
room and take them with you. It is not pleasant to trip over 
such things. 

Don't forget to clean the finger marks from paint when you 
are cleaning rooms. 

Don't forget to clean the bed-springs; they should be 
cleaned twice a month. Bedroom closets should also be 
cleaned twice a month. 



CHAPTER VII 
THE SERVANTS' HALL 

In large households there is a hall, or dining room, for the 
servants. This room should be so arranged that it can be used 
for a general sitting room in the evening. It is taken care of 
by the kitchen maid. In some houses the servants have also 
the use of the front basement as a sitting room. Again in many 
places they are expected to eat in the kitchen and to use a part 
of it for a sitting room. 

Very few of the old downtown houses have the advantage 
of wholesome and sufficient servants' quarters, but in the newer 
dwellings the architects and owners seem to recognize the fact 
that the little company, which is to keep the great house clean 
and sanitary, cannot be clean or well in its different members 
without sufficient room and appliances for keeping clean. 

The general government of the servants' hall rests with the 
butler and the cook. 

Each servant has a right to some time off duty, and to some 
time out of the house. The common rule in regard to return 
in the evening is that each should be in by half-past ten, and 
doors locked before eleven. Any one wishing to remain out 
later should obtain permission, the butler reporting the men 
and the women applying to the liousekeeper. 

In smaller households in the question of time off duty, the 
cook has every other Sunday afternoon and evening, one even- 
ing in the week after dinner is served, and occasionally an 
afternoon, say from three to ten-thirty. If no kitchen maid is 
kept, the cook prepares the dinner and the laundress cooks it. 

The waitress has the same time off, the chambermaid taking 

37 



38 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

her place, if no j^arlor maid is kept. The chambermaid has the 
same privilege, the waitress turning down beds, taking water 
to the rooms, and making other arrangements for the night. 
Two or three servants must be at home to answer family calls 
and door-bells, the mistress arranging this matter so that there 
may be no misunderstanding. 

The butler has every other afternoon off, footman alternat- 
ing, returning at five o'clock. If the butler is single-handed, 
he has one or two nights a week and a few hours of an afternoon. 
Where a number of servants are kept, they have more time off 
and arrange this among themselves. 

Servants should be downstairs not later than six-thirty in 
the morning, and when they have work especially demanding 
an early hour, even earlier. "Work which takes the maid or 
man in the presence or sight of the family or its guests should 
be well over in the early part of the day. There are two reasons 
for this : one is that the work may be an annoyance and inter- 
ruption to the family ; another is that workers cannot do so 
well when they feel that they are intruding. In well-organized 
households servants are not in evidence after lunch except in 
direct personal service. 

In the servants' hall breakfast is commonly served at seven 
o'clock or half-past seven, dinner at twelve or half -past twelve, 
and supper about half-past five. These hours vary, however, 
and are subject to the conditions of individual households. 
They should be so arranged that all may be prompt at the table, 
and that the duties which bring them to the household and keep 
them there, may not be interfered with. 

In regard to their rooms, as a rule they have the top floor, 
some of the men rooming out. 

The Store-room 

Groceries and supplies for a household of any size should, if 
possible, be bought in quantity, and, therefore, every house 



THE SERVANTS' HALL 39 

should have a store-room. In this room an account book should 
be kept, and in it should be entered the date when each store 
is bought and the price paid for it. 

The store-room should be absolutely dry and furnished with 
shelves, nails, and drawers. A suspended net or two should 
also be supplied for hanging lemons, oranges, etc. Earthenware 
jars are necessary for sugar, oatmeal, rice, tapioca, sago, barley, 
spices, etc., and if it is wished to keep on hand the pound 
cake and fruit cake of our grandmothers (and cakes made 
from old-fashioned receipts given in this book will keep for 
years), no place for their preservation is so good as a dry 
store-room and earthen jars with tight-fitting covers for their 
snugger quarters. 

Onions, shallots, and garlic should not be put in the store- 
room, nor in the ice box, but hung from the ceiling in some 
cleanly, odorless room. Onions absorb germs, and care should 
be taken to keep them under most perfect sanitary conditions. 
Vegetables will keep best in a dry dark place out of the air. 

The housekeeper, if one be kept, otherwise the mistress, or 
the cook, keeps the key to the store-room. The cleaning of the 
room is done by the kitchen maid or cook, and supplies are put 
in by the useful man. 



CHAPTER VIII 
HOUSEHOLD RECEIPTS 

To clean White Paint 

To clean white paint, take a small quantity of whitening on 
a damp piece of old white flannel and rub over the surface 
lightly. It will leave the paint remarkably bright and new. 

Mahogany and General Furniture Polish 
A mahogany polish that is highly recommended is prepared 
by mixing well together one quarter of a pint each of turpen- 
tine, linseed oil, alcohol, and vinegar. Put in a bottle and shake 
before using. The furniture should be cleaned first with a soft 
flannel and a little of the mixture applied at a time. When well 
rubbed in, polish with an old silk handkerchief. 

Floor Polish 
One quart of turpentine, five cents' worth of ammonia, and not 
quite half a pound of beeswax. Chip the beeswax up fine and 
put it on the stove to melt. When melted, pour it in the tur- 
pentine and add the ammonia. Then set it in a tin pail of hot 
water on the back of the stove to heat ; and leave it in the water 
while using it, for it goes on better when warm. Rub it on with 
a flannel cloth; and for polishing, the best thing is a piece of 
Brussels carpet, for it is rough and does not require so much 
strength as a smooth cloth. 

To make Window Glass Opaque 
Dissolve a tablespoonful of Epsom salts in a glass of beer or 
ale. The combination is best effected by heating. Wipe the 

40 



HOUSEHOLD RECEIPTS 41 

mixture over the window you wish to cover with crystals. It is 
impossible to see through the lace work. Greater opaqueness 
is gained by increasing the quantity of salts. 

To clean Marble 

Take two parts of common soda, one part of pumice stone and 
one part of finely powdered salt. Sift the mixture through a 
fine sieve and mix it with water, then rub it well all over the 
marble and the stains will be removed. Rub the marble over 
with salt and water, wash off, and wipe dry. 

To clean Tinware 

The best thing for cleaning tinware is common soda. 
Dampen a cloth, dip it in soda, rub the ware briskly, wash and 
wipe dry. 

To clean Cut Glass 

Having washed cut glass articles, let then dry and afterward 
rub them with prepared chalk, with a soft brush, carefully going 
into all the cavities. 

How to clean a Tea or CoflFee Pot 

If the inside of either is black from long use, fill with water 
and use a good-sized lump of washing soda and let it boil for an 
hour. Scald well after and it will be clean and bright. 

To clean Benares Brass 
Wash, and rub with half a lemon. 

How to Clean Coppers 

Take a handful of common salt, enough vinegar and flour to 
make a paste ; mix together thoroughly. There is nothing 
better for cleaning coppers. After using the paste, wash thor- 
oughly with hot water, rinse in cold water, and wipe dry. 



42 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

To put away Silver 

In putting silver away, be careful to get the silver tissue 
paper which can be bought very reasonably at Tiffany's. Silver 
is not so likely to tarnish when this paper is used. After 
wrapping in tissue paper, use brown wrapping paper outside, 
never using newspapers, as the printers' ink has a very bad effect. 

Bric-a-brac Mending 

The skill of bric-a-brac menders is not fully appreciated un- 
til it has been tried. Often the article is beyond restoration to 
its original form or use, but is capable in their clever hands of 
transformation into some other almost equally ornamental or 
serviceable thing. A woman whose cut glass carafe lost its neck 
through an accident, had it converted into a beautiful rose bowl 
at a trifling expense. In this case the bric-a-brac mender was 
also a glass cutter, but it is not difficult to find this combination 
or to seek the cut-glass worker in his special shop. 

To mend Broken China 

Powder a small quantity of lune and take the white of one 
egg and mix together to a paste. Apply quickly to the china 
to be mended, place the pieces firmly together, and they will soon 
become set and strong, seldom breaking in the same place again. 

Cleaning Fluid 

This fluid cleans cloth, felt, silk and woollen goods, and re- 
stores the color. 

Eight ounces of benzine, quarter of an ounce of chloroform, 
quarter of an ounce of sulphuric ether, eighth of an ounce of 
oil of wintergreen. 

Shake well before using and keep away from all heat and fire. 
Apply with a cloth suited to the fabric. 



HOUSEHOLD RECEIPTS 43 

The Best Way to wash and store Flannels 

Getting ready to leave town or getting ready for warm 
weather in town means the same thing in many respects. 

Flannels and flannel blankets must be washed and put away. 
The great point in washing blankets is to do the work so that 
they will preserve their softness and that the colored stripes 
may not lose their brightness. Soap should not be used in 
washing blankets ; instead, put either aqua ammonia or borax 
into the water. On delicate flannels avoid using plain soap. 
The best plan is to make soap jelly for the purpose in this 
way: — 

Shred finely as much soap as you think will be needed for 
the washing ; put it into a saucepan which should be kept for the 
purpose with just enough water, hot or cold, to cover it. Let it 
melt as slowly as possible until quite clear and free from lumps. 
Unless it is melted slowly it will boil, and boiling wastes it ; 
moreover, if boiled fast, or if the pan is too full of soap in the 
first place, it will boil over very quickly. If preferred, the soap 
may be set in a jar and melted in the oven. Any odds and ends 
of good soap may be used up in this way. It should be made 
fresh. 

To wash the flannels, have a tub half full of warm, not hot, 
water, and stir into it enough soap jelly to produce a good 
lather. If the water is hard, or the flannels are greasy, add a 
little ammonia to the water, a tablespoonful for every two gal- 
lons of water. If you are using ammonia soap, this last is natu- 
rally not wanted. Never rub flannels if it is possible to avoid 
it, as it is pretty sure to shrink them. But squeeze them in 
your hands, working them up and down in the soapsuds. 
Then turn them inside out and wash in a second lot of soap- 
suds rather weaker than the first, and rinse them at once in 
plenty of water, repeating this rinsing until the flannels feel 
quite soft and no soap is left in them. If soap is left in, the 



44 3IBS. seely's cook book 

material becomes hard and sticky and has a disagreeable odor 
when dried. Use warm water to rinse in, for either hot or 
quite cold rinsing water shrinks and hardens flannels. When 
thoroughly rinsed, wring them carefully as dry as possible, 
using the wringing machine as it will not twist the stuff ; then 
shake them out, pull into shape, and dry at once in the open air 
if possible, in a good wind and out of the sun. 

They must not be dried in so hot a place as to make them 
steam, as it is as bad for them as using boiling water. Shake 
the flannels and turn them now and again while drying, pulling 
them gently into shape. Iron when nearly dry with a cool 
iron. Flannels shrink from the soap being rubbed on to them 
instead of using soap jelly; from being washed or rinsed in 
over hot or cold water ; from being left lying about wet instead 
of drying them at once ; from being dried too slowly or in too 
hot an atmosphere, and from being ironed while wet with too 
hot an iron. New and sanitary flannels may be soaked for half 
an hour or so in warm water with a little ammonia as before ; 
cover the tub to keep in the heat and squeeze and wring them 
out of this before the water gets cold. 

Rice Water for washing Challies 

Rice water is about the best thing to use in washing chal- 
lies. Boil one pound of rice in five quarts of water. When 
somewhat cool, put the challies in with rice and the rice water 
and wash well, using the rice much as you would soap. If no 
rinsing is used, the rice will have a good effect upon the fabric. 

To make Starch 

With cold water thoroughly dissolve the starch. Then 
pour on boiling water, stirring constantly. When made, stir it 
round two or three times with a wax candle. By doing this 
you keep the starch from sticking to the iron. 



HOUSEHOLD RECEIPTS 45 

To remove Iron Rust 

Mix salt with a little lemon juice ; put in the sun. If 
necessary, use two applications. 

To take Mildew from Linen 

Rub the spots with soap, scrape chalk over them, rub them 
well, lay the linen on the grass in the sun and, as it dries, wet 
it a little. The spots should come out in two applications. 

To take out Mildew 
Dip the stained cloth in buttermilk and lay in the sun. 

To cleanse a Chamois Skin 

Wash it in cold water with plenty of soap, rinse well in 
clear cold water. You may wash a skin in this way as often 
as you please and still keep it soft.

CHAPTER I 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 



The two things most essential to a successful dinner in these 
days are, — well-chosen company and good service. If to these 
you can add artistic cooking and beautiful table ornaments, so 
much the better, but the best food loses half its savor if we are 
bored while eating it, and the best talk is apt to flag if there 
are long pauses between the courses. 

The hostess should send out her invitations at least two or 
three weeks beforehand. (These invitations should be answered 
at once, certainly within twenty-four hours. No obligation is 
more exacting than a dinner engagement, and nothing but ill- 
ness should ever permit one to break it.) 

To assure the success of her dinner she should be certain 
that her guests are agreeable to one another, and when seating 
them at her table arrange so that the talkative ones may be 
next to the more silent ones. She should consider the capa- 
bilities of her cook and not attempt dishes bej^ond his skill and 
knowledge. Her dining-room servants should be so trained 
that they serve the dinner in silence, not even the sound of a 
footfall should be heard. 

To begin with the table : the prettiest to look at are tho^e 
which are five feet square, wdiere two people sit on each sic ^, 
but they are by no means the best for social purposes. T' 

46 



DINNEBS AND DINNER-GIVING 47 

corners stick out and interfere somewhat with the service, and, 
what is more serious, the talk does not seem to pass them easily. 
At dinners of more than ten or twelve, conversation must neces- 
sarily, most of the time, be a series of duets, and all a hostess 
can do is to assort her pairs carefully beforehand. But one of 
the chief charms of a small party is that the talk may be general, 
and experience has shown that it is not nearly so likely to flow 
smoothly back and forth if there is a little angle jutting out 
between two of the guests. And then, if there should be only An-ange- 
six people, two of them sit on one side, two on the other, and "^^"^^^ 
the host and hostess at the ends alone, with an empty space on 
either side of them, which has a somewhat chilling influence. 
The old-fashioned round table, which may be made as long as 
one chooses by the insertion of leaves, is much more practical, 
and one which is four feet six across is quite large enough for six 
people. It is a good plan to have one of the leaves cut in half, and 
the addition of a half-leaf will usually make the table large enough 
for eight. People do not want to sit with their elbows pressed 
against their sides, like trussed fowls, and there must be room 
to pass the dishes between them. But after comfort is once 
assured, the closer together people are seated the better for the 
gayety of a dinner. 

The most convenient dining room, so far as service is con- pian of 
cerned, is one in which the door into the pantry is at the farther ^^"^^^ 
end, away from the entrance into the room, because the screen, 
which should always hide a pantry door, can in that case also 
hide a table from which the service of the table is performed. 
Besides the dining-table with its chairs, and the sideboard, The side- 
every dining-room should have a serving-table, which is usually ^^^ ' 
of polished wood, with a shelf across it halfway down. This 
ti.ble is in view of the guests, and on it are placed the finger- 
b ;/wls with their doilies and plates, and any reserve glasses or 
tuble accessories which are pretty to look at, such as the cakes 
^..c dessert. Decanters of wine always look well standing on 



48 



MRS. SEELY'S cook BOOK 



the sideboard until the time for wine serving. The carving can 
be done in the pantry if there is no way of concealing what may 
be called a working serving-table, but if one can be placed be- 
side the pantry door and behind the screen, it is a great advan- 
tage, as it obviates much opening of the pantry door, which, by 
the way, should always have a spring and no latch, so that it 
may be pushed open and will close noiselessly. The working 
serving-table is best made of ordinary soft wood, with the legs 
stained dark, and should be covered between meals with any 
table cover which will look well in the room. While in use it has 
a canton flannel undercloth, and a white tablecloth over that, 
folded like a scarf lengthways, so that it may not interfere with 
the servants' feet. It should be large enough to admit of the 
carving being done on it comfortably, and on it the butler keeps 
his reserve plates, except those which must be brought in hot 
from the pantry, his knives, forks, spoons, and the other tools of 
his trade. 

Following the principle that the appearance of the table is 
less important than the enjoyment of the dinners, any high orna- 
ment or decoration should be avoided at a little dinner. If your 
guests have to dodge a plant or peer round an urn, in order to 
see their opposite neighbors, they will soon be discouraged, and 
limit themselves to those on their own side. So in preparing 
the table it is a good plan for two persons to take seats on 
opposite sides of the table and move the candles or vases until 
the right position is determined. If candles are used, they 
should be made secure in the sticks and the shade-holders so 
placed that they will slip down steadily as the candle burns. 
The wicks should be lighted for a few moments and then ex- 
tinguished before being placed on the table, so that they may be 
easily relighted just before the guests enter the dining room. 

A favorite decoration for a large table is a centerpiece of 
flowers. But those who prefer to enable guests to see one 
another across the table often prefer a piece of silver of graceful 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 49 

shape, but not too tall in the middle, and slender vases of silver 
or glass, each holding a few flowers. The little dishes holding 
candied fruits, peppermints, nuts, or things of that sort (which 
the French call '^ the four beggars," probably because they appear 
so persistently) stand among these vases. If there are candles 
on a small table, in order to avoid crowding it is better to have 
merely a bowl of flowers in the middle. The bowl should not be 
packed full, nor be flat, squat, and ungraceful in effect. The 
flowers may be stuck into wet sand or moss, or fitted in between 
twigs twisted together in the bottom of the dish, and thus held 
the stems will stand upright and slightly apart, instead of lolling 
over on each other. The custom of laying flowers and leaves, 
or ferns, directly on the tablecloth is not wholly to be recom- 
mended. In the first place, unless they are arranged with great 
taste and skill, they look messy, and then there may be some one 
at the table who cares for flowers, and it will not add to his 
pleasure to see them dying slowly of thirst before his eyes. 

As dinner is supposed to be the pleasant ending of a day, 
the table should convey an impression of rest and simplicity 
when the party is informal. At a large entertainment the dec- 
orations may be elaborate if the host chooses, but if a small 
table is crowded with odds and ends of china and silver, they 
are sure to be soon pushed away, and the effect is fussy and 
untidy. 

Opinions vary as to using colored glass. Some Venetian Glass, 
and French glass is certainly very decorative ; but the beautiful 
color of wine demands pure white glass, and taste now tabooes 
the colored. Elaborately embroidered cloths are also beautiful ; 
but nothing can be handsomer than fine white damask, spotless, 
and looking as though it could easily be washed. 

In the following remarks, the words " butler " and " foot- 
man " are used, because they are immemorially associated with 
table service, but their places may be taken, and very often Table 
are, by a well-drilled waitress and a parlor maid. In large 



service. 



50 



MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 



establishments, where there are several footmen, the latter do 
most of the service; the butler does not have to touch the 
plates, but he carves, serves the wines and bread, rings from 
the pantry as soon as a course is on the table, to give the cook 
due warning of the next, and always removes the bread 
crumbs. There are other details of his service, but in the pres- 
ent instance we will suppose that the head servant, whether 
man or woman, has but one assistant, with whom he works 
harmoniously. 

The manner of setting a table is pretty much the same in 
all good houses. After the cloth has been put on perfectly 
straight over its undercloth of felt or canton flannel, the 
creases, if it has been folded and not rolled on a roller, should 
be smoothed out with a flatiron, which must not be too hot 
for fear of spoiling the surface of the table. If plates have any 
crest or monogram, this should be carefully put toward the 
middle of the table, and quite straight one with another. 
Napkins are folded the monogram on top, and are laid on the 
plates with a piece of bread or roll placed in the fold in such a 
way that it may be seen. Elaborate devices for napkins are 
entirely out of date. At the right of each plate, with edge 
toward the plate, is a steel knife for the meat and sometimes 
a silver one for fish (although in old-fashioned houses the 
latter are not used), and, if there are oysters, a tiny oyster 
fork. A tablespoon for the soup may go with the knives. At 
the left, tines up, are the forks, never more than three ; a small 
fork, for the fish, which often matches the fish knife, and a large 
one for the first entree. The one to be used first is the farthest 
away from the plate. 

Tumblers and glasses, the last articles to be placed on the 
table, as they are easily knocked off and broken, go on the right 
of the plate, and there are as many of the latter as there are 
wines to be given. At a large dinner, for instance, there would 
be one for white wine, one for Sherry, one for Champagne, and 




i H 



BINNEES AND DINNER-GIVING 51 

one for good claret. Table claret is drunk from the tumbler. 
Glasses for Port or Madeira are not put on the table until these 
wines are served. The glasses must be placed in groups, the 
water glass nearest the plate, and the wine glass to be first used 
nearest the edge of the table. 

Everything needed in serving the dinner should be in its 
place, the platter for the hot dishes in the hot closet, and on 
the side table, the extra silver, cutlery, and china ; also bowls 
of cracked ice. There should be possible no delay in serving. 

The butler keeps count of guests as they arrive, and when Seating the 
all is in readiness he comes to the door of the drawing room and quests, 
says ''the dinner is served." 

If there are cards with the guests' names, these are laid Use of 
on the cloth, at the top of the plate, or at one side, wlier- ^^^^®' 
ever they may be most easily seen. The host always comes 
into the dining room first, with the lady who is to sit on his 
right, and who is helped first; the hostess comes in last 
of all. In the case of a very high official, the hostess goes in 
first with him, but these suggestions do not deal with questions 
of precedence. As the hostess usually knows the plan of the 
dinner table, and where different people are to sit, cards will 
not be necessary except for a large dinner. Here good servants 
are of use, for they may quietly help her by indicating where 
different people belong. 

As soon as a guest is seated, and has taken his napkin and Serving the 
bread from his plate, the butler puts down on it another on ^*^^^s^s- 
which are oysters, clams, or melons, according to the season, 
neatly arranged on a small doily. Oysters and clams should be 
served on plates of cracked ice, six or eight on each plate, with 
a quarter of a lemon in the centre. Although the former are 
said to be better if eaten from their deep shell, for formal 
dinners they look rather prettier on their flat upper one. The 
plates should be placed on the plates already in front of each 
guest, after the napkins have been lifted. As the butler puts 



52 MRS. seely's cook book 

down the oysters or clams, the footman should follow with a 
small silver tray on which are black cayenne, liquid red pepper, 
and grated horseradish. Brown-bread sandwiches, cut very 
thin, and spread with unsalted butter, are also handed with this 
course. Black pepper and sifted sugar are the accompaniments 
of melons. 

When the oysters have been eaten, their plates are taken 
away, and the soup plate is put down on the plate which was 
on the table at the beginning. When caviar sandwiches or 
anchovy toast are served instead of oysters, they are always 
handed, and when the plates on which they have been eaten 
are taken away, the bare cloth is left, on which the soup plate 
is put down. In England the soup is always put down directly 
on the table, and there is no prejudice against seeing the bare 
cloth between courses, which makes service much easier than 
when plates are put down and whisked off again unused. The 
next course is soup, which is brought in from the pantry in 
a tureen, provided there is the " working serving-table," safely 
hidden by a screen. If there is no second serving-table, the 
soup is served from the pantry. The butler has the soup plates 
ready, and ladles the soup into them with a ladle or often a 
tea-cup, about six tablespoonfuls being considered the proper 
quantity to put in each plate, and the footmen set the soup 
plate in the front of each guest. 

When this course is finished, the two plates should be 
removed and replaced by a clean one. Plates should always be 
lifted by the left hand, and the fresh ones put in their places 
by the right. Then the hors d'oeuvres, such as celery, olives, 
etc., are passed on a tray. These plates are then replaced by 
hot ones for the fish. 

In placing plates for the fish, the butler takes one in 
hand, and goes round the table from . right to left, usually 
beginning with the lady who sits on the host's right. He 
should always put down the first plate with his left hand, 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 53 

and then transfer the other, that he may put it down with the 
left hand also, and this rule applies to all table service. The 
reason for it may easily be seen if any one will take the trouble 
to try the experiment when people are sitting at a table, of 
serving with one hand and then the other. He will find that 
if he uses the left hand he faces the guest, and takes up much 
less room than if he tries to use his right, because that brings 
his shoulder in the way. Knives are the only things properly 
put on the table with the right hand, because they are slipped 
on the table at a guest's right, other service being always at 
the left. In putting on forks the butler goes from left to 
right, because it is easier to slip them in at the left side. 

Boiled or fried fish is served upon a napkin, but with a baked Serving 
fish a napkin is not used, as it is often customary to pour sauce ^^^' 
over the baked fish. The fish is passed, each guest helping him- 
self. Smelts are invaluable for dinners, because it is so easy to 
help one's self to them, or fillets of fish, which often have 
their sauce on the dish. If broiled shad is given, each piece 
should be carefully cut apart from the others on the dish, 
before it is handed, so that it may be lifted easily, and the 
same rule applies to boiled and baked fish. With boiled fish, 
boiled potatoes cut into small balls are sometimes served, 
though not so often as formerly ; with baked or fried fish, 
sliced cucumbers, made very cold, with dressing of oil and 
vinegar. 

For a dinner of six there should always be two servants, if Service for 
possible, and even then, unless they work well together, things ^}^^^^ ^^ 
which should be served at the same time do not always manage 
to make connections. We can all remember feasts where he 
who came last in order of service did not get any sauce until 
his fish was cold, nor any vegetable until he had eaten his 
meat. The butler should hand the fish, and the footman follow 
him with the sauce and cucumbers, for instance, on the same 
tray.

MBS, SEELY'S COOK BOOK 



The ideal dinner for quick service is one where everything 
is taken directly from the kitchen to the plate, and where no 
carving nor division is needed. For instance, if there are 
smelts, lamb chops with peas in the same dish, and small birds, 
the party stands a better chance of getting away from the 
table in good time than if they are given broiled shad, spring 
lamb, and roast chicken, each of which requires time spent on 
it between the kitchen and table. Young housekeepers will 
spare themselves much anguish of mind by remembering this, 
especially if they have only maids, as not one woman in a hun- 
dred has been taught to carve well and quickly. 

At restaurants the dish ordered is usually shown to the 
giver of the dinner before it is taken away to be cut up, but 
this is not done in a private house. 

It is usual, but by no means obligatory, to have an entree 
between the fish and the meat. 

The entree is always handed; and when it has been eaten, 
the second fork which was put on the table when it was set 
will have been used. If but two were placed at first, fresh 
forks must be given for the meat. After the entree plate 
has been removed, the butler takes the requisite number of 
knives on a small tray, and places them first, following them 
with the forks, and putting them on as we have just described. 
Fresh knives and forks should never be put on the table during 
a course, nor laid on the clean plate. 

If the dish of meat must be carved, the butler does it at the 
serving-table or in the pantry, and the footman can easily take 
two plates, one in either hand. By the time he has put on 
four plates he may begin to hand the sauce or vegetables, as 
the butler, if he is at all quick, can easily finish the carving 
for eight people, let us say, and can then put down the last 
four plates. Ordinarily, in this country, as soon as a plate 
which has been used is taken away, a clean one is put in its 
place, which is all right if the next dish is to be handed ; but if 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 65 

each guest is to be helped to his share, it will be better from 

the point of view of service not to put on any plates after the 

last preceding course, as it is manifestly impossible, with one 

pair of hands, to get an empty plate out of the way, and put Removing 

two full ones down. As a general rule, no plate should be p^*^®^- 

removed at any course until every one at the table has finished, 

but this rule must be broken sometimes at a large dinner, as 

one talkative or deliberate person may keep the whole service 

back indefinitely. 

Our service, which is mainly modelled on that of the French, 
differs from theirs in two particulars. We serve a separate 
vegetable such as artichokes, cauliflower, or asparagus between 
the principal dish of meat and the game, whereas the French 
prefer it after the latter, and we usually serve cheese, for some 
strange reason, before the sweet dish, while in Europe it comes 
just before the fruit, as it is especially intended to take away 
the taste of sweet things from the palate, and prepare it for the 
fine wines, such as port and madeira, which are served with the 
fruit. Cheese is often replaced in England by various dishes Cheese. 
known as "savories/' and they are gaining ground in this 
country. A typical savory is made of cheese, highly seasoned 
with red pepper, in a souffle, or small sandwiches of caviar are 
handed as a savory, the object being always to stimulate appe- 
tite, or rather thirst. If frozen punch is to be used, it must Frozen 
come before the game. It is generally served in small glasses, P^^^- 
one standing on each plate with small spoon on the plate with 
the glass. 

Supposing that the dish of meat has been followed by a 
vegetable, such as asparagus, the next course would be game, 
and this may be preceded or replaced by what is called a 
" chaudfroid," for which there is no name in English. Its 
French title, however, " hotcold," describes it well. A chaud- 
froid is something which has necessarily been cooked, therefore 
was hot, but which is cold when one eats it. Fillets of game or Chaudfroid. 



5Q 



MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 



poultry with a cold sauce, for instance, is a very common chaud- 
froid, and salad is served with these dishes, as with game or 
pates. Some people like crescent-shaped side plates for salad, 
which is sensible when game is served, for the cold dressing and 
the hot juice do not mingle well, but on the other hand they take 
up room and complicate the service. Spring chickens, squabs, 
or a fine old ham may take the place of game, or again, at an 
informal dinner, cheese may be served with the salad. 

After the last course, which is usually the cheese, with 
which bread or biscuits are served, the crumbs should be re- 
moved from the table. If there are many large pieces of bread 
or rolls left, the footman should go first and pick up each one 
with a fork, placing it upon a clean plate which he holds in his 
other hand, and he is followed by the butler, who collects the 
crumbs with a silver scoop or scraper, or, in some. houses, with 
a clean napkin folded over into a small roll. This, however, is 
not as effective as the silver scoop. All plates, small silver, 
salts and peppers, hors d'ceuvres, and glasses which will not be 
again needed, are taken off the table. 

Then the dessert and fruit plates with the finger-bowls are 
put before the guests. Each fruit plate bears a small ornamental 
doily with a finger-bowl about one-third full of water with the 
chill off, and often with a sprig of rose geranium or verbena in it, 
or a few violets or pansies. With the plates are placed fork, 
dessert spoon, and fruit knife. After the hostess lifts her 
finger-bowl from her plate, the guests lift theirs. The dessert 
is now passed, each individual helping himself. The dessert 
plates are then removed, and plates are then served for fruit, 
fresh and candied, etc., which are then handed. 

Dessert being finished, the hostess leads the ladies to the 
drawing room and the gentlemen follow soon, after coffee and 
liqueurs have been served to them and those have smoked who 
wish to do so. The smoking may take place either in the din- 
ing room or smoking room or library, as circumstances dictate. 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 51 

At the same time coffee and liqueurs are also served to the 
ladies in the drawing room ; while later in the evening, after the 
gentlemen have joined the ladies, apollinaris or some other 
sparkling mineral water is handed. 

A smart dinner to-day is served in an hour, or very little 
longer, and as the gentlemen do not stay in the smoking room 
more than fifteen or twenty minutes, and the company remains 
together in the drawing-room for about the same time, it is easy 
to see that the whole entertainment may be easily got through 
with in a couple of hours, leaving the rest of the evening free. 
This is an immense improvement over the ponderous feasts of 
even a dozen years ago, when people sat for hours in a hot room 
eating five times as much as they wanted, and perhaps tired to 
death of their companions. 

We have spoken here of a small dinner, for six or eight, but Service for 
the same general rules apply to larger ones. At these, two ^^^^er 
soups, a thick and a clear one, are still often given, the footman 
carrying both soup plates, and saying to each guest, for instance, 
" Julienne or gumbo ? " A light entree, such as a souffle of 
cheese, or chicken in little cases, or a vol-au-vent is sometimes 
served between the soup and the fish ; the fish is in some 
rather ornamental form, such as little fillets, but the useful fried 
smelt still holds his place. Then comes another entree, perhaps 
of sweetbreads or a mousse or timbale. Then the meat, the 
separate vegetable, the roast or chaudfroid with salad, the sweet 
dish, or even two of them, such as a baba followed by ice-cream, 
or the second sweet may be replaced by a savory. 

The necessity for good service cannot be too much insisted 
upon. One servant to five guests is the very smallest number Proportion 
with which a large dinner can be well carried off, and then only ^^ guests'** 
if the servants are used to working together. It is better to 
allow one to four, especially if you have to call in professional 
waiters. For this reason it is more economical to have eighteen 
people rather than sixteen ; you will need four servants to take

proper care of the smaller number, and they can just as well 
manage two more. Unless you have an accomplished chef, or 
a cordon bleu, be careful to have only dishes which your cook 
knows by heart and is sure to make well ; a large dinner strains 
the resources of an ordinary establishment, and is no time for 
experiment or uncertainty. If your artist sometimes fails in 
her clear soups, but has a talent for creams and purees, choose 
one of the latter, and select entrees with which she always suc- 
ceeds. No matter whether some or all of your guests have had 
the same thing at your house before, they will probably not 
notice if they are enjoying themselves ; and even if they do, it is 
infinitely better than that there should be a dreary pause, fol- 
lowed by some dish which is an evident failure, to the mortifica- 
tion of the hostess. 

If there are more than ten people, two dishes of everything 
which is handed should be started at the same time, as it takes 
too long for one to make its way round. Service begins with 
the lady who sits on the host's right, or whom he has taken in; 
but when there are two dishes, the second should start with the 
hostess, who sets a good example by helping herself, whether 
she wants any or not, and also makes the first cut into a timbale 
or anything of that sort. 

A clearly written list of the dinner, with the accessories to 
each course, should be posted in the pantry, and each servant 
should know what he or she is to do. If the butler is compe- 
tent, he will, of course, attend to this, and if possible he should 
never leave the dining room, where his especial duty, besides 
carving, is, as his name implies, to serve wines. These commonly 
are now : a white wine with the oysters, and Sherry with the 
soup ; Champagne is served with the fish, and continued through- 
out the dinner ; good claret is given with the roast and game. 
Port with the cheese or savory, and Madeira with the fruit ; but 
the only real necessaries are Sherry and Champagne. Madeira 
should always be served with terrapin. Table claret is often

offered after the soup, and if a guest accepts, his glass is filled 
about a third full, and he is given his choice of plain or mineral 
water. Both of these waters should just have come off the ice, 
but it is better to put none in the tumblers, as some people dis- 
like it. In these days of gout and diet, so many persons drink 
Scotch whiskey and soda that it is usually offered, especially 
if Champagne is refused ; and if whiskey is accepted, it is often 
served in tall glasses, which are ready on the sideboard, leaving 
the ordinary tumblers for water. These water tumblers should 
not, by the way, be filled beforehand, as is sometimes done. 

Good claret should stand in a warm room before it is wanted, 
to let it settle and get mellow, for if it comes directly from the 
cellar it has a rough taste and no bouquet. 

Sherry for soup, on the other hand, is better if it has been 
kept all day in a bottle in the ice-chest, and only decanted just 
before dinner. A " brut " Champagne is usually served now, so 
cold that it is almost oily when poured out, with very little 
foam. This does not mean that it is flat, however, for the little 
bubbles of gas may be seen rising steadily from the bottom. 

Although this chapter is nominally limited to dinners, a Luncheons, 
few words may be added about luncheon, which, among people 
who go out or entertain much, is not the elaborate function 
sometimes described. If the hostess is so lucky as to have a 
handsome mahogany table, there is often no cloth to hide it. 
There may be a centrepiece of lace or embroidery, and in that 
case it is pretty to have it match the napkins or doilies, and 
also the other little doilies which protect the table from being 
scratched by the plates. Grapefruit, bouillon, or clam broth 
is served first, and then there may be eggs in some ornamental 
fashion, stuffed, or with a sauce, or else lobster in chops, or a la 
Newburg, or broiled smelts — any little dish of eggs or fish. 
Then may come lamb chops, or little fillets of any meat, with 
potatoes and one other vegetable, and then birds or broiled 
chicken, or an aspic of some sort, with a salad, and afterward an 



60 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

omelette souffle, a biscuit, or ice-cream. Black coffee is served 
afterward. Sherry and claret, or white wine, are usually on 
the table; whiskey and soda may be offered, but most ladies 
drink only mineral water at luncheon. Champagne should be 
served only late in the day. A simple luncheon would con- 
sist of eggs or fish in some form, one dish of meat, and cold 
ham with salad, or cream cheese with jam, followed by stewed 
fruit or custards baked in little cups. In summer the mistress 
and the cook should exercise their ingenuity in devising all 
sorts of attractive cold dishes, and a good butler can always 
make several varieties of cup, although many persons prefer 
iced tea or coffee. 

We add three simple menus, for dinners of six, ten, and 

sixteen people respectively. Fourteen, by the way, is a number 

to be avoided if possible, as among so many some one is likely 

to drop out at the last moment, leaving one with the dreaded 

thirteen.

WINES. 
Decanting, Warming, Cooling, and Serving. 

Wines and liquors are commonly in the keeping of the 
butler — in fact, the word '' butler " is derived from the Latin 
huticula^ a little bottle, through the French houteillier^ bottler. 
In the drinking habits of the old days, the care of the wine and 
liquors and the constant and gross serving of them might have 
kept a man busy in a menage of not great size. In our own 
times, however, when wines are so commonly bought bottled, 
and the organization of households has become more complex. 



62 MRS. seely's cook book 

the duties of butler have broadened and refined. Still the 
butler in these times has charge of the bottling and binning 
and of the temperature of the wine cellar or wine room, and 
he should know enough of that strange and living thing called 
wine to help his employer choose the right material, if his ad- 
vice is asked, and to keep all wines and liquors in his charge 
under conditions most favorable to their development and per- 
fection. He should never leave wine in cases, but unpack and 
bin it as soon as it arrives. 

Rules for the decanting of wine have from time to time been 
given, but for Ports and clarets and such as show a deposit on 
the bottle, none are better than the following: — 

In decanting, the butler should first take all possible care in 
removing the bottles from their bins, and never fail to lay the 
bottle down on the side it has been lying in the bin. The de- 
posit the wine has cast upon the side of the bottle not only 
destroys the brilliancy of the wine, but also its flavor and 
aroma. Then he should be sure of the quality of each bottle, 
that is, he should guard against serving bottles tasting or smell- 
ing of corks rotten or decayed by fungous growths. It is hardly 
necessary to add that he should see that his decanter is brilliantly 
clean inside and out. 

After he has taken the bottle of wine out of the bin he 
should carefully lay it on the table, keeping still the same posi- 
tion. If two laths have been nailed on his decanting table, he 
will have gained a steady base for work. Let him hold the 
bottle tightly with one hand, and after slowly tipj^ing it obliquely 
till the wine no longer touches the cork, he should apply his 
corkscrew and extract the cork without the slightest shake or 
movement to the bottle. 

A candle set the other side of the bottle will permit him to 
see through the wine, and in drawing it into the decanter he 
should watch its condition. As soon as the cloud or deposit in 
the bottle nears the neck, he should stop ; for not a particle of 



DINNERS AND DINNER-GIVING 63 

such deposit, cloud or crust, should flow into the decanter. But 
this clouded wine should not be wasted. It will mix, especially 
if Port wine or Sherry. Put the bottoms of wines together in 
the kitchen-use bottle ; for such mixtures are good for flavoring 
soups, puddings, and jellies. 

Another good old-fashioned rule in decanting is this : When 
a bottle is three-fourths decanted, even if the deposit is still un- 
disturbed, decant the remainder in a wine glass, and add from 
the glass to the decanter, as long as the cloud does not reach 
the glass. 

Do not decant more wine than will be needed. The aroma 
is lost if the wine is too much exposed. Heavier wines should be 
decanted first ; the lighter wines later, since their ethers are more 
volatile. Old Sherry may be decanted the day before it is used, 
and the decanter left without its stopper. Hock, upon the other 
hand, should be decanted an hour before it is served. Some 
judges of wine would decant claret as it is wanted, having kept 
it at a temperature of seventy degrees for ten or twelve hours 
before serving, while others would decant it two hours before it 
is drunk. Port should be decanted not more than two or three 
hours before it is served. Champagne it is not necessary to de- 
cant when it is under ten years old. In opening Champagne 
bottles, cut the wire and strings at the bottle's rim. Then hold 
the cork down with the left thumb and with a pointed piece of 
wood cleanse the rim. Extract the cork slowly so that no noise 
is caused, and have glasses at hand to hold the flow of a lively 
bottle. 

In serving wines the taste of the guests should be considered, 
and after that the occasion, and the temperature and humidity 
of the outdoor air. Some temperaments and physiques with 
blood oxygenated by an outdoor life enjoy a heavier and rich 
wine ; the sedentary student is apt to take a lighter and drier 
vintage. The milder wines naturally come first. If more than 
one quality of a wine is served, the younger should come first. 



64 MRS. SEELT'S cook BOOK 

Claret should be served warm — not warmer than eighty de- 
grees and not cooler than sixty-five degrees. The medium point 
of seventy degrees brings out the qualities of the wine. The 
bouquet is lost if it is too warm. Bordeaux and Burgundy 
should have the same temperature as claret, except Chablis and 
other white Burgundy, which should be at forty-five degrees. 
Port should be served at a temperature of from fifty to fifty -six 
degrees — the point fifty-five is a much approved one. Madeira 
takes sixty-five degrees as the temperature best adapted to its 
constitution, Sauterne and other white claret fifty degrees, and 
Sherry is best at forty or forty-two degrees. Champagne should 
have a temperature of thirty-four. To cool this wine, lay it on 
ice, the sweet several hours before using, the dry for half or 
three-quarters of an hour. In laying the bottles on the ice, or 
in a pan of cracked ice, have care not to shake the bottle. 

With oysters may go Chablis, Sauterne, a light Moselle or 
Hock. 

After soup, an old Madeira or Tokay or Sherry. 

With fish, Sauterne, Hock, Chablis. 

With entrees. Claret, Bordeaux, Burgundy. 

With roasts, Champagne, Moselle, or fair claret. 

With game. Burgundy, claret. 

Sweets, Madeira, Port, Sherry or Champagne. 

People of a discriminating palate often pronounce for one 
good wine at a dinner. That wine, it should be added, is not 
Champagne — the drinking of which with all kinds of food 
some epicures pronounce a gastronomic sin. The same authority 
also advises us to avoid as poisons the serving and drinking of 
all brandies, whiskeys, and sodas, after wine. 



CHAPTER II 

Selection of Fish 

Fresh fish are hard when pressed by the finger ; the gills 
red, the eyes full. If the flesh is flabby and the eyes sunken, 
the fish are stale. Fish should be thoroughly washed, cleaned, 
wiped, and sprinkled with salt. 

The earthy taste often found in fresh-water fish can be re- 
moved by soaking it in salt water. Most kinds of salt fish 
should be soaked in cold water for twenty-four hours, the fleshy 
side turned down in the water. Never soak fresh fish in water 
unless frozen. 

Before broiling fish rub the gridiron with a piece of fat to pre- 
vent the fish sticking. Lay the skin side down first. 

In boiling put the fish into cold water to which a little salt 
and vinegar have been added. Serve fish always with sauce. 

Selection of Meats 

In selecting beef, choose that of a fine smooth grain, of a 
bright red color and white fat. The third, fourth, fifth, and 
sixth ribs of beef are the choicest cuts for a roast. Have the 
bones removed and the meat rolled. The butcher should send 
the bones for a soup. 

The flesh of good veal is firm and dry and the joints stiff. 

The flesh of good mutton or lamb is a bright red, with the 
fat firm and white. 

If the meat of pork is young, the lean will break on being 
pinched, the fat will be white, soft, and pulpy. 

To judge the Age of Poultry and Game 

The breast-bone should bend easily from side to side. 
Broilers are best from one to two pounds. Fowls for roasting 
p 65 



66 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

can be judged by the wings. If the skin breaks when the wing 
is turned toward the head, the fowl is tender. Old fowls have 
scaly legs and the breast-bone is hard and will not bend. 

Turkey, The cock bird has a smooth black leg mth a short 
spur. The eyes are bright and full and the feet supple when 
the bird is fresh. The absence of these signs denotes age and 
staleness. The hen bird may be judged by the same rules. 

Creese. In young geese the feet and bill are yellow and free 
from hair. When fresh, the feet are pliable ; they are stiff 
when stale. 

Buck may be judged by the same rule. 

Plover when fat have hard vents, but like all other birds 
may be chosen by the above rules. 

In the partridge yellow legs and a dark bill are signs by 
which a young bird may be known. Rigid vent, when fresh ; 
when this part is green, the bird is stale. 

Pheasants. The young birds are known by the short or 
rounded spur which in the old is long and pointed. 

G-rouse, woodcock, and quail may be chosen by the above 

rules.

Rules for boiling Meat 

All fresh meat, unless for soup, should be put into boiling water. The 
outer part is contracted by the heat, and the juices are preserved. The meat 
should be allowed to cook very gently and no salt added until it is nearly 
done. 

In boiling meats it is important to keep the water constantly boiling, 
otherwise the meat will absorb the water. Be careful to add boiling water 
if more is needed. Remove the scum when it first begins to boil. Allow 
about twenty minutes for boiling for each pound of fresh meat. The more 
gently the meat boils, the more tender it will be. 



68 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

Salt meats should be put into cold water and boiled slowly, that the salt 
may be extracted in cooking. 

A red pepper dropped into the water will prevent the rising of any un- 
pleasant odor. 

For making soup put the meat on the fire in cold water.

minutes are required for every pound of beef. Season when nearly done. 

Clean meats by wiping them with a cloth kept for that purpose. Do not 
put meat into water.

To broil Meat Well 

Have your gridiron well greased and hot before you put the meat on. 
Broiling is not only the most rapid manner of cooking meat, but is justly 
a favored one. It has nearly the same effect upon meat as roasting. The 
albumen of the meat is hardened and forming a skin it retains the juices. 
Broiling meat should be turned rapidly in order to produce an equal effect, 
but it should not be punctured with a fork.

Read this Advice 

In cooking follow as far as possible the rule of the druggist in compound- 
ing any mixture, that is, mix the ingredients thoroughly, putting in one at 
a time. For instance, if you have three ingredients mix two before adding 
the third, and stir in the third well before adding a fourth, and so on. All 
compounds gain from following this rule. 

The value of a pan of hot water in cooking cannot be overestimated. 
Set in the upper oven, it insures good baking. If the oven becomes too hot, 
use cold water in the upper pan. In heating vegetables, canned corn for 
instance, upon the top of the range, setting the saucepan in a pan of hot 
water saves much labor and watching. Besides this, the use keeps sauce- 
pans in good condition until fairly worn out. All breakfast grains or cereals 



72 MBS. seelt's cook book 

should be cooked in this manner. A pan of hot water furnishes a double 
boiler ready at hand at all times. 

A most important kitchen utensil is a good set of scales and weights. 
They are indispensable to assure success in cooking. Without them there 
is no precision in proportioning the various ingredients. Therefore it is 
absolutely necessary to have a set of scales. The cook should bear in mind 
always to put the weights away in their place and to keep the scales in 
thorough order. In weighing anything of a greasy nature the cook should 
place a piece of paper on the scales. By doing this she will save herself 
much trouble, and keep her scales clean. 

Milk and butter should be kept in closely covered vessels so they will 
not absorb odors from other articles. 

The time during which an article is coming to the boiling-point cannot 
be counted in any rule or measure for boiling. 

Always use porcelain-lined pans for cooking fruits or an acid preparation. 



CHAPTER IV 
SOUPS 
^ Bouillon 

Select a piece of the luicler round of beef, weighing about 
ten pounds. Trim off all the fat and cut off a piece weighing 
about one pound. Cut the rest in small pieces. Put it in a soup 
kettle with nine pints of water. Let it slowly come to a boil. 
Skim thoroughly and move the kettle back where the liquid will 
keep boiling slowly but steadily for six hours. Then add one 
large onion sliced thin, one slice of carrot, a slice of turnip, and 
a small muslin bag containing the following spices and herbs : 
three dozen pepper corns, six whole cloves, small piece of cin- 
namon, two sprigs of thyme and summer savory, three bay 
leaves, a small leaf of sage, two sprigs of parsley, and three 
blades of celery. Also stir in three teaspoonfuls of salt. Let 
all cook one hour, then draw the kettle to the front of range 
and boil vigorously for one minute. Strain and set away to 
cool. The next day skim off all the grease. Put stock into 
the soup kettle with the piece of meat which was cut off the day 
before. See that it is chopped very fine. Beat the whites of 
three eggs until very light, stir into the kettle with other in- 
gredients. Place on the range and heat slowly to the boiling- 
point. Stir occasionally. When the soup bubbles, move the 
kettle to the back part of the range, cover, and keep just at the 
boiling-point for one hour. Taste to see whether it has suf- 
ficient seasoning. Strain through a wet bag and it is ready to 
serve.

Pot au Feu 



The true way to cook this national dish of France is in an 
earthen pot or pipkin. This pot has a close-fitting lid, is very 
strong, and is most excellent for the slow cooking which the 
success of the dish demands. The earthen pot may be had in 
this country and also a very good substitute may be purchased. 

The soup or broth is made afresh once or twice a week by 
every family in France not too poor to afford it. It is often 
served on the first day with slices of bread, on the second with 
variations of vermicelli, rice, or other garnishes. The general 
process of making it is always the same. The popular treat- 
ment is thus described by a famous cook : The soup pot of the 
French artisan supplies his principal nourishment and is thus 
managed by his wife, who, without the slightest knowledge of 
chemistry, conducts the process in a truly scientific manner. 
She first lays the meat in her earthen stock pot and pours cold 
water to it in the proportion of about two quarts to three 
pounds of beef. She then places it on the fire where it slowly 
becomes hot, and as it does so the heat enlarges the fibre of the 
meat, dissolves the gelatinous substances which it contains, 
allows the albumen to disengage itself and the most savory parts 
of the meat to be diffused through the broth. From the simple 
circumstance of boiling it in the gentlest manner a savory and 
nutritious soup is obtained and a dish of palatable and tender 
meat. If the pot is placed over a quick fire, the albumen will 
coagulate, harden the meat, prevent the water from penetrating 
it, and the savors of the meat from disengaging themselves, and 
the result will be a broth without flavor or tastiness and a 
tough, dry piece of meat. 

The broth of the dish forms in France the foundation of all 
richer soups and gravies. Poured on fresh meat, it makes an 
excellent consomme. If properly managed, it is clear and pale. 

Poultry, pigeons, and even game may be boiled in the pot 



SOUPS 75 

au feu. They should be properly trussed and stewed in the 
broth long enough to make them tender. A small ham also 
may be laid in with the beef when the water is first added. 
Boiled in this bouillon three or four hours, it is superior in 
flavor to a ham cooked in water, and the taste of the ham im- 
proves the soup. But the soup cannot well be eaten the day 
the ham is boiled, for it must be allowed to cool and be freed 
from the fat of the ham. In case you boil a salted ham in the 
soup, you will of course require no other salt. The ham should 
of course be freed from any rusty or blackened parts and washed 
perfectly clean. 

The French housewife begins her pot au feu soon after 
breakfast and puts the ingredients gradually in the pot. Thus 
by the end of the day and the independent cooking of the 
ordinary fire of the kitchen she has her most nutritious, tooth- 
some, and substantial meal. 

One way to make it is this : For a large pot au feu take six 
pounds of good fresh beef, cut it up and pour on it four quarts 
of fresh cold water, set it over the fire, skim it when it simmers, 
and after it has come to a boil add a teaspoon of salt, some pep- 
per, and half a pound of liver cut in pieces. Then add two or 
three large carrots, either sliced or grated, four turnips pared 
and quartered, eight young onions peeled and sliced in thin 
slices, two of the onions roasted whole, a head of celery cut up, 
a parsnip well cut up, six potatoes hand-sliced and quartered, 
tomatoes in season, and in short any appetizing vegetable. A 
bunch of sweet herbs cut small and absorbed by the dish or 
boiled and removed on serving also adds much to the savory 
compound. 

Let the whole continue to boil slowly and steadily for six 
hours. Serve by laying slices of bread in a tureen or deep 
platter, pour the stew or soup upon them, including not only 
the broth but the meat and vegetables. What is left in the 
tureen may go into the pot au feu for next day. 



76 MRS. seely's cook book 

For beef you may substitute mutton, venison, or other tooth- 
some meats. 

Pot au Feu 

Take three pounds of lean beef, wind it about with twine to 
keep it from boiling to pieces, lay it in the soup pot, and pour 
over it about six quarts of fresh cold water. Set the pot over 
the fire and when the water begins to boil add two carrots, three 
onions, one having been stuck with three or four cloves, and in 
its season one turnip. To this pot au feu may be also added 
various bones and meats of the larder still sweet and holding 
their natural oils and flavors; for instance, a beefsteak bone, or 
chicken head, etc. 

Let the soup boil slowly six or seven hours, then take it off 
the fire, strain, and set away in a dark, cool place. For immediate 
use take the lower part and every morning skim and bring it to 
a boil so that the supply from which you draw daily may not 
spoil. 

The meat of the pot au feu, which the French call boeuf 
bouilli and eat, is commonly served with the vegetables cooked 
with it and dressed with some piquant sauce, or egg sauce. 

Beef Broth 

Four pounds of soup beef, eight quarts of water, two table- 
spoons of salt. Boil slowly, remove the scum, add one carrot, 
one turnip, one onion with three cloves stuck in it, a clove of 
garlic, two leeks and a stalk of celery tied together. Cover 
partially, add a little water when required to replace that evapo- 
rated, and let simmer five hours. Skim the fat and strain 
through a wet bag. 

Beef Soup 

Take four pounds of beef, not too fat, four whole onions 
medium size, five small carrots or one large one, and cover with 
cold water. When all come to a boil, boil slowly and skim. 



SOUPS 77 

Then add salt and pepper carefully. Set back on the stove and 
simmer until the meat is very well done. Take off the stove and 
add two or three small strips of green pepper while hot. Set in a 
cold place over night. Next day skim all the grease off, remove 
the beef and vegetables save the carrot. Strain the soup, return 
it to the kettle, add the carrot, boil or simmer until the meat is 
heated well through. Thicken with flour and water stirred 
smoothly until a little thick. Boil rice, well done, in a rice 
boiler. Place a tablespoon of rice in a soup plate and pour the 
soup over it. To this can be added pieces of the meat and 
carrot if desired, or it can be used as a clear soup. It is im- 
proved by chopped parsley added after the soup is thickened, 
and let stand a short time to extract the flavor. 

Mutton Soup 

Mutton makes a very delicate soup boiled according to the di- 
rections for beef soup. Use onions in the same way and flavor 
with a little stewed tomatoes that have been cooked and seasoned. 

Curry Soup 

Put four pounds of lean beef in a kettle and pour over it three 
quarts of cold water and one teaspoonful of salt. Let it stand 
one hour, then set it on the fire and cook slowly for two hours. 
Chop the following: two onions, two potatoes, one small carrot, 
one head of lettuce, and add to the soup. Cook one hour longer, 
then strain. Return to the kettle and add two tablespoonfuls 
of rice, one scant tablespoonful of curry powder, season to taste, 
and cook one hour longer. Serve very hot with cheese straws. 

Ox-tail Soup 

Cut in short pieces two ox tails and soak them in fresh water 
for three hours, changing the water once in a while. Put on the 
fire, cover with cold water, boil five minutes, cool and wash well. 
Drain, put into a saucepan with two quarts of beef broth, two 



78 MRS. seely's cook book 

quarts of water, two carrots, one onion with two whole cloves 
stuck in it, a bunch of parsley, a head of celery, and a little salt. 
Then cook slowly for about three hours. With a skimmer 
transfer the tails to another stewpan, drain the carrots, strain 
and free the broth of its fat, and thicken with three ounces of 
flour browned in three ounces of butter. Add two glasses 
of Sherry and a glass of Port wine, white pepper, and a dash of 
cayenne. Boil one hour, skim, and press through a cloth over 
the ox tails. Add the carrot cut in small pieces and two dozen 
small glazed onions. Boil a few minutes longer, skim again, 
and serve. 

Brunoise Soup 

Take two each of the following vegetables : carrots, tur- 
nips, onions, leeks, and a head of celery. Cut them in small 
dice and fry the pieces in a pan over a slow fire with one ounce 
of butter and a little sugar. If the butter be fresh, add a little 
salt. When the vegetables are a light brown, pour over them 
three quarts of light stock, either veal or chicken. When this 
comes to a boil, skim it thoroughly and remove to the side of 
the stove to boil gently until the vegetables are cooked. Then 
add one-half pint of green peas, a handful of French beans cut 
in diamond shape, and one-half pint of asparagus tips, these 
vegetables to be boiled beforehand. After testing the flavor 
and seasoning, serve very hot. 

Flemish Soup 

Have' at hand carrots, turnips, and cucumbers, two of each. 
Peel the latter and scrape the first. Then with a vegetable 
scoop cut them in fancy shapes about as big as an olive. Cut 
the white part of two heads of celery and three leeks in thick 
shreds about half an inch long. Blanch or parboil these for 
five minutes, drain them on a sieve and place in a soup kettle 
capable of holding about three quarts. Add two generous 



SOUPS 79 

quarts of consomme or stock. Boil until the vegetables are 
sufficiently done. Boil slowly and skim occasionally. While 
the soup is boiling, boil the following vegetables, which when 
blanched add to the soup : one handful of Brussels sprouts, 
one-half pint of young peas, a few French beans cut small, and 
a handful of asparagus heads. Add a pinch of coarse white 
pepper. Let the soup boil three or four minutes. Place some 
dried croutons in a tureen, pour the soup upon them and serve. 

Hollandaise Soup 

Peel two carrots, the same number of turnips and cucumbers, 
and cut them into the shape of small olives. After blanching 
them, boil them in one quart of strong white broth, made of veal 
or chicken. When the vegetables are cooked, remove from the 
range and add the yolks of four eggs mixed with twice as much 
water as there is egg liquid, one gill of cream, and a small lump 
of butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir over the 
fire until the soup is of the desired consistency and then pour into 
the soup tureen containing one gill of young peas and an equal 
quantity of French beans boiled tender and cut into diamonds. 
Serve very hot. 

Julienne Soup 

Cut lengthwise in short fine shreds two carrots, two turnips, 
two stalks of celery, the wliites of two leeks, a white onion, and 
a few white cabbage leaves. Mix all, and with four ounces of 
butter set them on the fire. Stir occasionally until quite dry. 
Then add three quarts of beef broth. Boil slowly for forty-five 
minutes. Skim off all the fat, add one scant teaspoonful sugar 
and one-half pint of small, cooked green peas. Boil two minutes 
longer with a handful of chervil, sorrel, and lettuce leaves cut in 
fine shreds. 

White Broth 

Place in a kettle over a moderate fire a heavy knuckle of 
veal with all the scraps of meat, including bones — not of game 



80 MBS. 

— at hand. Cover fully with cold water and add one handful 
of salt. As it comes to a boil, skim carefully. No scum should 
be left on. Then put in two large well-scraped carrots whole, 
one whole well-cleaned turnip, one large peeled onion whole, one 
well-cleaned parsley root, three thoroughly washed leeks, and a 
few leaves of cleaned celery. Boil very slowly on the corner of 
the range. Skim the grease off. Then strain through a wet 
cloth into an earthen bowl. Set away in cool place for use 
when needed. 

Consomme with Vegetables 

Put in a soup kettle one roasted fowl, two pounds of lean 
veal, some roast beef bones (if convenient), two pounds of soup 
meat, eight quarts of water, two tablespoonfuls of salt. Boil 
slowly for four hours. Skim well. Then add one carrot, one 
onion, one-half a parsnip, one turnip, two leeks, and a few pepper- 
corns. Let all simmer for four hours. Remove all the fat and 
strain through a wet cloth. This broth should be' very clear and 
of a rich yellow color. With a small tin tube cut round pieces 
of carrot and turnip in thin slices, add a leek cut crosswise. Par- 
boil them, drain, and then boil one hour with three quarts of the 
broth. Add a finely sliced small heart of lettuce, sorrell, and 
chervil leaves; boil ten minutes longer. Finish with a little 
sugar and three tablespoonfuls of small green asparagus tops. 
Pour into a soup tureen with the crusts of two French rolls cut 
in small rounds and dried in the oven. Cover the tureen. Be 
sure to serve it hot. 

Mock Turtle Soup, with Chicken Forcemeat Balls; 
with Bgg Balls 

Begin making the soup the day before it will be wanted. A 
calf's head is one of the articles needed, but a part of it may be 
used for dishes other than the soup. The following ingredients 
will make six quarts of soup : one calf's head, one shin of 



SOUPS 81 

veal weighing six pounds, one onion, two tablespoonfuls of 
chopped carrot, two tablespoonfuls of chopped turnip, three 
stalks of celery, a piece of stick cinnamon about three inches 
long, one-half a blade of mace, ten whole cloves, twenty white 
peppercorns, a bay leaf, one sprig of parsley, four tablespoonfuls 
of butter, six of corn-starch, a tablespoon each of walnut, mush- 
room, and tomato catsup, two lemons, a quantity of cold water, 
one gill or more of Port, salt and pepper, and, if one chooses, 
some egg or forcemeat balls. It may seem as if six quarts of 
soup were too large a quantity, therefore it may be well to say, 
in explanation, that a calf's head is sufficient for that quantity, 
and half of a head cannot be bought. If all the soup be not 
wanted at one meal, it may be warmed again. 

Have the butcher split and scrape the calf's head and saw 
the bone of the shin of veal into several parts. Wash all care- 
fully. Put the head into a large pan, covering it with cold 
water. Soak i^ for two hours. At the end of that time take 
out the brains, place the head in a large soup pot, and after 
putting in the shin also, pour in eight quarts of cold water. 
Heat it slowly to the boiling-point. Then skim carefully and 
set the pot back where the liquor will simply bubble for three 
hours. When that time has passed, take up the veal with a 
skimmer and then remove the head, being careful not to break 
it. Strain the stock that is in the soup pot and put all but two 
quarts away to cool. These two quarts should be returned to 
the kettle with the shin of veal ; the spice mentioned above 
should be added and the kettle covered and set where its con- 
tents will only simmer. Now put the vegetables, cut fine, and 
the butter into a frying pan and fry gently for twenty minutes. 
At the last moment draw the pan forward so that the vegetables 
may become slightly browned by more rapid cooking. Be care- 
ful they do not get burned. Add these vegetables to the veal 
and stock and cook all for four hours. Then strain and put 
away to cool. 



82 MRS. seelt's cook book 

The next morning, after skimming off all the fat, turn the two 
lots of strained stock into the sou^) pot and set upon the stove. 
Add the catsup, also salt and pepper in quantities to suit your 
taste ; and when the soup boils up add the juice of a lemon, the 
wine, and the face of the calf cut into small strips. Cover the 
soup pot closely and set it back where its contents will hardly 
bubble during the next fifteen minutes. It will then be ready 
to serve ; but if it be intended for a late dinner it may be cooled, 
put away, and heated again when wanted. Thin slices of lemon 
cut in quarters and egg balls and forcemeat balls should be put 
into the tureen before the soup is turned into it, if one would have 
mock turtle soup in perfection. As it takes much time to make 
forcemeat balls, they may be omitted, but egg balls are easily 
prepared and should be used. 

Chicken Forcemeat Balls 

Chop very fine half of the breast of a tender chicken, pound 
it in a mortar and rub it through a coarse sieve. There should 
be a generous cupful of the meat after it has been rubbed through 
the sieve. Pour one quarter of a cup of cream into a saucepan 
with a scant quarter of a cup of fine bread crumbs and a bit of 
whole mace. Cook until the mixture forms a smooth paste. 
It will take about ten minutes. Remove the mace and add one 
tablespoonful of butter, salt, and white pepper to taste, the 
meat, and the white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth. Mix 
well, and when cool form in balls about the size of grapes. 
Have ready a pan of salted boiling w^ater. Cook the balls for 
five minutes, turn them in a strainer and then add them to the 
mock turtle soup. The above balls may be prepared three or 
four hours before the soup is served. 

Egg Balls 

Boil four eggs for twenty minutes until hard. Plunge them 
in cold water and remove the shell. Pound the yolks in a 



SOUPS 83 

mortar until tliey become a smooth paste. Then add one tea- 
spoonful of salt, a little white pepper, and a well-beaten raw 
egg. Mould the mixture into balls about the size of grapes, 
and roll them in flour. Fry in hot fat until they become a light 
brown. Turn them frequently while they are cooking. 

French Mock Turtle Soup 

Put in soup kettle half a shin of beef. Let the meat stand 
in cold water one hour, add one tablespoonful of salt to draw 
out the blood, then put on the fire and cook for six hours. 
Skim off all the grease and scum that rise for the first hour. 
Strain and set aside until the next day. Take a nice calf's 
head, parboil it, take the meat off and cut in inch square pieces. 
Take off the fat from the soup. Cut up two onions, one carrot, 
two fresh mushrooms, one clove of garlic, and one blade of mace. 
Whip up the whites and yolks of three eggs. Mix them in 
with the vegetables. Pour over them the cold stock and set 
on back of the range. Let mixture boil up slowly, stirring 
until it comes to a boil. Then let it boil slowly for twenty 
minutes. Then strain. It should be clear. Add the meat 
from calf's head. Continue to boil until tender. Drop in some 
egg balls, one glass Madeira wine. Serve very hot. 

Dubarry Soup 

Prepare two quarts of clear chicken bouillon. When ready, 
add one cup of washed and drained rice and boil until it is 
tender. Then rub through a sieve. Add one cup of boiled 
cauliflower pulp which has also been rubbed through a sieve. 
Thin this mixture to the desired consistency with cream. 
Season to taste with salt and white pepper and add the well- 
beaten yolks of two eggs mixed with some of the cream. Stir 
over the fire until the mixture comes to a boil. Cut some 
truffles in small pieces, mix with the soup, and serve very hot.

Mulligatawny Soup 

Cut up two chickens as for a fricassee, place them in a pan 
with one carrot, one onion, one head of celery, and a bouquet. 
Cover with a good broth made of veal, and when the chicken is 
almost done, strain them off into a sieve, saving their broth in 
a basin. Plunge the pieces of chicken in cold water to blanch 
them, drain, and set away for future use. Now cut four large 
onions in half, remove the root part, and again cut them into 
slices. Place in a pan with four ounces of butter, a carrot, and 
two heads of celery cut in small pieces. Fry these until the 
onion is nearly melted, then stir in as much flour as will suffice 
to thicken the quantity of soup you wish to make. Stir this 
on the fire for a few minutes, and after stirring in one teaspoon- 
ful of curry powder and the same quantity of curry paste, 
gradually add the broth the cliickens were boiled in and as much 
more veal broth as desired to make the required amount. When 
it comes to a boil, set it at one side of the range to clarify or 
settle. Rub it through a wet cloth and pour it over the pieces 
of chicken. Half an hour before dinner, stir the soup over the 
fire until it comes to a boil, then set it to one side and boil it 
slowly for ten minutes. By that time the chicken will be done. 
Skim the soup, and after tasting it to determine the seasoning, 
serve it with plain boiled rice in a separate dish. 

Puree of Game 

Skin and clean two fat wild rabbits and wipe them with a 
wet towel. Remove the fillets and free them from all the thin 
skin and sinews. Draw and clean two partridges, remove all 
the breast meat, lift up the skin and free the meat of the small 
sinews. Put the fillets aside for future use. Cut all the car- 
casses in small pieces. Place them in a soup kettle with a scant 
five quarts of beef stock. Place over a hot fire and watch until 
it begins to boil and remove all the scum and grease. Season 



SOUPS 85 

with two white onions, three medium-sized carrots, two leeks 
tied with a small bay leaf and a very small bunch of thyme, one 
tablespoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of black pepper. 
After adding the seasoning, let the mixture boil slowly for one 
hour and a half. Leave the kettle partly uncovered. When 
it has boiled the given time, strain through a colander into a 
large bowl. Let it become partially cool, then skim all the fat 
from the surface, remove the broth from the bowl with a cup, 
leaving a little in the bottom of the bowl to avoid the dregs. 
Strain the second time through a wet cloth. Put two table- 
spoonfuls of butter and two of flour in a saucepan. After it 
has cooked for five minutes pour the broth over it, a cupful 
at a time. Stir constantly. Let it simmer twenty minutes. 
Remove the pan to the side of range and pour in slowly, con- 
stantly stirring, one-half pint of rich cream. Do not boil after 
this is in. Place the partridge and rabbit fillets as folloAvs : 
cover the bottom of a roasting pan with thin slices of larding 
pork. Season each one of the fillets with a little salt and pepper. 
Place them side by side in the pan and cover them with a thin 
layer of pork. Pour over them five tablespoonfuls of the game 
broth. Bake in hot oven for fifteen minutes. Baste twice dur- 
ing the cooking. Remove from the pan. Cut the rabbit fillets 
in very small squares, partridge fillets in thin square slices one- 
half inch wide. Serve the puree very hot after adding the 

minced fillets. 

Green Turtle Soup 

Green turtle when prepared can be kept for weeks, and 
dealers are not willing to retail it. The best way is to buy a 
small turtle weighing about twenty-five pounds. If your 
dealer will not prepare it, hang it by the hind legs or fins, cut 
off its head and let it bleed all day. Then with a sharp knife 
part the two shells, remove the intestines, take all the meat 
from the shells, bones, and fins. Cut each shell in four pieces, 
and plunge — for a moment only — the fins and shells in boiling 



86 MBS. SEELY S COOK BOOK 

water to take the horny skm off. Then make a broth as fol- 
lows : Cut in pieces and put in a stock pot twenty pounds of 
lean soup beef, six gallons of water, and plenty of salt. Boil 
slowly and skim well ; add four onions, four carrots, four leeks, 
two heads of celery, a bunch of parsley, four bay leaves, thyme, 
sage, and basilic in proportion, and one handful of whole pep- 
pers, a few allspice, a few whole cloves, and a few blades of mace 
all tied together in a small cloth. Boil six hours and pass the 
broth through a sieve into a large tin pan. Use some of this 
broth diluted with water in a saucepan to cook the shells and 
fins, and some in another saucepan to cook the meat. The 
shells and fins require about one hour, and the meat not over 
twenty minutes. When they are done, take the shells, meat, and 
fins out of the broth and pass the broth through a fine strainer 
into another saucepan. Remove all the bones from the shells, 
fins, and meat, and cut in small square pieces. Mix the whole 
and put it in a dish. 

The above is the preliminary and essential preparation. 
For a soup for eight persons : Thicken three quarts of broth 
with four ounces of flour which has been browned in butter, 
boil one-half hour, and skim well. Add one-half pint of Sherry 
wine, one gill of Port wine, a dash of cayenne pepper, and a 
portion of the turtle. Boil ten minutes, skim again, and serve 
with slices of lemon. 

To preserve what is left of the turtle, reduce to a consist- 
ency the rest of the broth, add the turtle, and boil five minutes. 
Put in quart tin cans, which should not be quite filled. When 
cold, pour into each can, over the turtle, some melted lard to 
keep out the air. Set in a cool larder for further use. One 
quart is enough for eight persons. 

Stewed Oysters a la Baltimore 

Open neatly three dozen oysters. Place them in a sauce- 
pan without their liquor and add one ounce of good butter. 



SOUPS 87 

Cover the pan and place it over the fire. Cook for two min- 
utes. Then add one wine-glass of good Madeira wine and a 
very little cayenne pepper. Cook together a little longer and 
then add one gill of Espagnole sauce and one-half a glass of 
demiglazed sauce. Stir thoroughly until it comes to a boil. 
Just before serving add the juice of one lemon, one teaspoonful 
of butter, one teaspoonful of finely chopped parsely. Serve im- 
mediately in a tureen. 

Oyster Bisque 

Two quarts of oysters in a saucepan with a little white pep- 
per, nutmeg, two blades of mace, one bay leaf, one pinch of red 
pepper, two ounces of butter, one pint of white broth. Cover, 
boil ten minutes, drain in a colander, and save the liquor. Then 
chop the oysters very fine and put them on a plate. Knead 
five ounces of flour in a saucepan with four ounces of melted 
butter. Stir and cook a little without allowing to brown. 
Then dilute with three pints of boiled milk and the oyster 
liquor. Add the oysters, stir steadily, and boil ten minutes. 
Rub through a very fine sieve and add more milk if required. 
Stir and boil again. Finish with one-half pint of raw cream 
and four ounces of butter in small bits. Taste, pour in soup 
tureen, and serve hot, with small squares of bread fried in butter 
separately on a plate. 

Clam Bisque 

Boil one quart of opened clams for twenty minutes in three 
pints of good veal consomme. Strain and add two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, two tablespoonfuls of blended flour, and one pint 
of cream. Cook for a few minutes. Then stir in the well- 
beaten yolks of four eggs. Cook a few minutes longer. Sea- 
son with salt and white pepper to taste. 

Clam Chowder 
One quart of opened hard clams, drained and chopped very 
fine, two dozen soft-shell clams, chopped in the same way, with

the hard part removed. Cut one quart of peeled potatoes in 
small squares. Bruise and steep one-half pound of hard crackers 
in cold water. Chop two large white onions and two ounces of 
salt pork very fine. Put the pork and onion in a stewpan with 
one ounce of butter. Fry until a light brown, add the potatoes, 
six peeled and sliced tomatoes, one quart of water, three pints 
of white broth, veal or chicken, ground thyme, mace, sage, and 
white pepper to taste. Boil thirty minutes. Then put in the 
clams with their liquor and the crackers. Boil thirty minutes 
longer. Skim the fat, add four ounces of butter and chopped 
parsley, mix thoroughly, and serve at once. 

Pish Broth 

Fry four ounces of butter with the following vegetables 
sliced fine : two onions, two carrots, and two leeks. Fry until 
quite dry. Then add four pounds of fish, — such as bass, black 
fish, flounder, or any bony fish, — the head of a fresh cod, one 
quart of white wine, and six quarts of water. Season with 
salt, peppercorns, bunch of parsley, and a few blades of mace. 
Cover the stewpan and boil one-half hour. Strain the broth 
and free it from its fat. Chop up two pounds of cod or bass, 
mix with two eggs, add the broth and a few more sliced vege- 
tables. Set on the fire and stir constantly until it begins to 
boil. Then let it simmer for ten minutes and strain through a 
wet cloth. Pour in a tureen with three or four dozen veal 
forcemeat balls fried in hot lard. 

Fish Chowder 

Skin a four-pound haddock, wash thoroughly, and cut the 
flesh from the bones in pieces about two inches square. Cover 
the head and bones with cold water and boil one-half hour. 
Slice two small white onions in a pan with four slices of thin, 
fat, salt pork. When tender, skim out the pork and onions and 
add the strained bone liquor and one quart of sliced raw potato. 



SOUPS 89 

Cook for ten minutes, then add the fish, one tablespoonful of 
salt, and one-half teaspoonful of white pepper. When the 
potatoes are tender, add one quart of hot milk which has been 
thickened with two ounces of butter and flour mixed together. 
Do not break the fish by needless stirring. Split six butter 
crackers, arrange in a tureen, and pour the fish chowder over 
them. 

Crab Bisque 

For eight persons use eighteen large, hard-shell crabs, one 
quart of chicken or veal stock, one quart of cream, one pint of 
stale bread free of crust, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one of 
flour, one small slice of carrot, one large slice of onion, two bay 
leaves, one stalk of celery, one sprig of parsley, a bit of mace, 
slight grating of nutmeg, one-fourth teaspoonful of white pep- 
per, dash of cayenne, and three teaspoonfuls of salt. Put one- 
half the meat of the crabs and all of the claws into a stewpan. 
Add the spice, vegetables, herbs, and half the stock, and place 
the pan where its contents will simmer gently for forty min- 
utes. Ten minutes later put the bread and the remaining 
stock into another stewpan, and set the pan where its contents 
will simmer gently for thirty minutes. When the first mix- 
ture has cooked for the proper period, strain it over that in the 
second stewpan. Mix all these ingredients thoroughly and rub 
through a fine sieve. Return to the fire and add butter and 
flour which have been rubbed together. Cook five minutes 
longer and add the cream heated in a double boiler, the re- 
mainder of the crab meat, salt and pepper. Let the soup boil 
up once and serve. If one choose, one tablespoonful of brandy 
and three of Sherry may be added after the bisque is taken 
from the stove. 

Crab Bisque 

Twelve large, hard-shell crabs boiled in salted water. The 
female crab, known by the light red claws and large flap, is the 



90 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

best. Drain, remove the large shell, but save the creamy part 
that sticks to it. Put this with the coral that is in the crab, 
pound fine with four ounces of butter and the yolks of four eggs, 
and rub through a sieve. Pare off the flaps and gills, wash 
off the sand, and pound what is left of the crab to a puree. 
Chop a medium-sized onion, put it in a saucepan with four 
ounces of butter, fry a minute or two, then add one pound of 
steeped and pressed white of bread and the crab puree. Stir 
the whole to a paste and gradually stir in one-half pint Catawba 
wine and enough white broth to make it of the right consist- 
ency. Add a bouquet and boil all for one-half hour. Rub 
through a fine hair sieve, stir and boil again. Add the pre- 
pared egg yolks, white pepper and a pinch of cayenne, one-half 
pint boiling cream. Mix well without boiling and pour into a 
tureen. If possible, serve with small boiled oyster crabs sepa- 
rately on a plate. 

Gumbo of Crabs 

Take eight large, soft-shell crabs, clean them, and pare off 
the small legs, flaps, and gills which are spongy and generally 
sandy. Wash, drain well, and cut each crab in about eight 
pieces. Put in a saucepan two ounces butter, two chopped 
shallots, and two ounces of ham cut very small. Fry a little, 
add one-half pint of white wine, five pints of white broth, salt, 
pepper, one bunch of parsley tied up with one bay leaf, one sprig 
of thyme, one clove of garlic, two cloves, one-half a green pep- 
per without the seeds and cut small, and finally the crabs. 
Cover, and boil slowly for one hour. Remove the parsley, 
skim the fat, and add six tablespoonfuls of gumbo powder. 
Drop the powder by the left hand quite a distance from the 
liquid, all the time stirring with the right hand. This pre- 
vents it from getting lumpy. Season highly, pour into a 
soup tureen, and serve with plain boiled rice on a separate 
dish. 



SOUPS 91 

Lobster Bisque 

Cover two lobsters weighing about one and one-half pounds 
each with boiling water. Add one tablespoonful of salt, one 
head of celery, one small bouquet, half an onion, and six whole 
peppers. Cook until the lobsters' claws can easily be pulled 
apart — it will probably take twenty minutes. When cool 
enough to handle, cut the lobster down the back and remove 
the meat from the body and the claws. Save the coral and the 
green fat. Put back all the tough part with the small claws 
and shells, and cook them for twenty minutes in the same 
liquor. The liquor must be considerably reduced. Dry the 
coral, then rub it through a sieve. In a saucepan mix one table- 
spoonful of butter with one ounce of flour. When it comes to 
a boil, stir in one quart of hot milk. Let this come to a boil. 
Then add one pint of the lobster broth. This must come to a 
boil. Then season with salt and white pepper. Stir in the 
sifted coral enough to give the liquid a bright pink color. 
Place the green fat and the lobster meat cut in fine pieces in a 
tureen, pour the hot mixture over them, and serve very hot. 

Sudden Call Soup 

While one quart of milk is heating in a double boiler, place 
a tablespoon of butter in a stewpan till it boils, — but does not 
brown, — add two tablespoons of flour, and when that is well 
mixed in, one teaspoon each of salt and celery salt, and a salt- 
spoon of white pepper. Add this hot thickening to the milk. 
Take a small can of salmon, remove the bone and skim, mince 
fine, and add to the heated and thickened milk. Boil up and

as far down as possible. Wash them and then boil in salted 
water. Drain immediately. Melt three ounces of butter in a 
stewpan, stir over a brisk fire for five minutes, add three ounces 
of flour, mix thoroughly, and then add two quarts of white 
broth and a quart of boiled milk, salt, white pepper, a dash of 
grated nutmeg, and a half teaspoonful of sugar. Stir constantly 
and let the mixture boil for ten minutes. Rub through a puree 
sieve. Pour in saucepan and let it come to a boil. If too 
thick, add more milk ; stir in a little butter. Serve with squares 
of fried bread in separate dish. 

Asparagus Soup 

Boil one quart of asparagus cut in inch lengths in one quart 
of water till tender. Rub through a colander and return it 
to the water in which it was boiled. Heat one pint of milk 
and pour it over one tablespoon of butter and one of flour 
well beaten together. Boil and then add to the asparagus. 
Pour in a tureen in which croutons have been placed, and 

serve. 

Puree of Barley 

Boil for an hour barley with broth enough to cover it. 
When it is quite softened, put the barley through a sieve, thin 
with broth or stock, season with salt and pepper, and serve hot 
with toast sippets or croutons. 

For this chicken broth may be used, or a broth or stock of 
mutton or beef. 

Cream of Barley- 
Boil slowly for four or five hours half a pint of barley, with 
an onion in a quart and a half of chicken broth. Put through 
a puree sieve, add a pint of cream or rich milk, boil up, set 
back on the range, add the beaten yolks of four eggs thinned 
with a little milk, and serve with croutons. 



SOUPS 93 

Barley Soup 
Boil in water for half an hour half a pound of pearl barley. 
Place this barley in two quarts of chicken, beef^ or mutton 
broth, add half a pint of dice made from turnip, carrots, and 
other vegetables, and boil gently for an hour or two. Season 
with salt and pepper, and when you serve, add a few green peas 
or a little sliced celery. 

Cream of Pearl Barley 

After washing half a pound of pearl barley most thoroughly, 
set it to cook in a quart of veal stock, and let it cook slowly at 
the back of the range for four or five hours. Divide the cooked 
barley in half, put one-half through a puree sieve and add to 
the other uncrushed half. Stir in a pint of boiling cream, sea- 
son to taste, and serve with sippets or croutons. 

Bean Soup 

Boil one pint of small white beans in one quart of water 
and one teaspoon of soda for five minutes. Pour off the boil- 
ing water and put the beans through cold water till the skins 
come off. Throw away the skins. Put the beans again in 
fresh cold water and boil till very soft. Add two quarts of 
rich milk, salt, pepper, and butter to taste ; afterward let the 
soup boil up a couple of times before serving. The soft part of 
the bean is of course broken up in the boiling and forms the 
thickening and gives the flavor to the soup. 

Black Bean Soup 
' Take three pints of black beans and soak them over night. 
Put them to boil early in the morning with two pounds of beef, 
one grated carrot, two onions, and six quarts of water. Boil 
until the beans are soft. Then put in twelve whole cloves.

through. Heat the mixture thoroughly, and add the juice of 



94 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

two lemons, three hard-boiled eggs cut in slices, one lemon cut 
in slices, a dash of red pepper, and Sherry wine to taste. Serve 
very hot. After straining, should the soup be too thick, add a 
little boiling water. 

Puree of Lima Beans 

Place one quart of Lima beans in a saucepan with salted 
boiling water, one onion with a clove stuck in it, a small piece 
of carrot, a bouquet, and one ounce of butter. Boil briskly 
until soft, drain in a colander, and save the liquid. Remove 
the onion, carrot, and bouquet, and pound the beans in a mor- 
tar, then mix with the liquid and enough white broth to make 
the desired quantity of soup. Rub through a puree sieve. 
Stir it over the fire until it comes to a boil, skim, and season to 
taste. Add two ounces of butter. When thoroughly mixed, 
serve with small pieces of fried bread. 

Beet Soup, or Barszcz 

Make a strong bouillon by stewing marrow bones and soup 
meats. Cook beets until they are delicate and tender, then 
slice them to make circles, and cut the circles in little fingers. 

This soup is often prescribed in Europe as extremely nour- 
ishing and strengthening. 

Cauliflower Soup 

Have one quart of clear white broth, free from grease, and 
one tablespoonful of finely chopped onion. Let them come to 
a boil. Rub one cupful of boiled cauliflower through a sieve, 
and add to the broth. Let one pint of milk come to a boil 
and stir that in. Season with salt and white pepper. If not 
thick and creamy, add a little flour blended with water. Then 
add one tablespoonful of butter, and one cupful of cooked 
cauliflower, in little branches. Stir in a tablespoonful of finely 
chopped parsley and serve very hot. 



SOUPS 95 

Chestnut Soup 

Boil two pounds of French chestnuts until they are tender. 
Remove the shells and peel them. Set aside twelve whole 
ones. The rest must be put into a mortar, pounded, and then 
rubbed through a sieve. Mix this puree with enough con- 
somme and cream — half of each ingredient — to make a rich 
cream soup. Season with salt and a little white pepper. Stir 
over the fire and scald thoroughly, but do not let it boil. Just 
before serving, cut the twelve chestnuts up in small pieces — 
each chestnut in five pieces — and stir in the soup. Serve 
very hot. 

Corn Soup 

Cook in a double boiler with three cups of milk for fifteen 
minutes the pulp cut and scraped from six ears of fresh corn. 
Cook the cobs in one-half pint of water. Stir one cup of 
cream sauce into the milk and pulp. Rub the pulp, etc., 
through the strainer, diluting it with the cob water. Heat 
again and season with paprika. If too thick, add more milk. 

Cucumber Soup 

Take six good-sized cucumbers, peel them and remove all 
the seeds, cut them in small pieces, and fry in melted butter 
until tender. Then rub them through a puree sieve. Place in 
a saucepan two quarts of white broth and the cucumber puree. 
Heat thoroughly and add one-half pint cream mixed with the 
yolks of four eggs. Stir over the fire until it becomes the 
desired consistency. Do not let it boil. 

Egg Soup 

Fry three sliced onions in a little butter until they are a 
light brown. Then pour in three pints of water and boil 
without a cover until the onions are tender. Remove the 
onions, which you may put through a sieve, and return to the 



96 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

pot or leave out altogether. To the boiling liquid add a tea- 
spoon of salt, a little pepper and sugar, and a teacup of milk, 
into which you have beaten smooth a tablespoon of flour. 
After the soup has thickened, take off the fire and add slowly, 
and one at a time, the yolks of four eggs. Pour over dice of 
bread fried, or merely plain toast, and send to the table hot. 

Mushroom Soup 

Have at hand two pounds of good-sized fresh mushrooms. 
Select twelve of them and set aside. Chop the rest and fry in 
melted butter. You can tell when they are done, for then the 
butter will be oily. Stir in tAVO tablespoonfuls of flour. When 
thoroughly mixed, add one pint of milk, and one pint of cream, 
and one cup of consomme. Cook slowly for fifteen minutes. 
Rub the soup through a colander, then strain through a cheese 
cloth. Season with salt and white pepper. Heat thoroughly, 
and serve. 

Cream of Celery- 
Cut twelve stalks of celery in small pieces, and boil with 
half an onion and a blade of mace in three pints of water for 
half an hour. Put through a puree sieve, add a pint of milk, 
salt and pepper to taste, and a heaping tablespoon of butter 
mixed with a tablespoon of flour. Bring the mixture to a boil, 
add a cup of cream, and serve at once. 

Cream of Cheese 

Bring to a boiling-point two cups of milk, two cups of 
white stock, and one onion. Take out the onion and thicken 
the liquid with one tablespoon of butter and flour rubbed 
together till smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste, stir in a 
full half cup of grated cheese, add an Qgg beaten light, and 
serve at once. A small pinch of soda in the milk before the 
cheese is added may prevent any separation, 



SOUPS 97 

Cream of Corn 

Add a quart and a half of water to each quart of corn, cut 
fresh from the cob, or if that cannot be had, to each quart of 
canned corn. Boil until the kernels are tender and then add 
two ounces of butter which has been beaten into one tablespoon 
of flour. Add fifteen or twenty more minutes to the boiling, 
season to taste, stir in a cup of cream, either plain or whipped, 
as preferred, and serve with floating croutons. 

Cream of Onion 

Peel and slice a dozen small white onions and fry them a 
light brown in a tablespoon of butter. Have ready in a double 
boiler a pint of water, a quart of milk, a saltspoon of salt and 
white pepper, a pinch of mace, and a double pinch of sugar. To 
this add the fried onions, cook slowly half an hour, and strain 
through a puree sieve. Add the yolks of three well-beaten eggs 
and a cupful of cream and serve at once. 

Potato Cream Soup 

Peel and boil six large potatoes. Mash them through a 
colander, add one quart of milk and one pint of cream, salt and 
white pepper to taste, and a piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Strain through a fine sieve. Pour into the tureen and sprinkle 
with very fine chopped parsley. Slice bread about half an inch 
thick, cut in strips about half an inch wide and three inches 
long. Arrange in frying basket, plunge in hot fat, and fry until 
light brown. Drain on brown paper, arrange on separate dish, 
and serve with the above. 

Cream of Rice 

Wash and parboil one pound of rice. Drain and cook 
thoroughly with two quarts of chicken or veal broth, then rub 
it through a puree sieve. Dilute with more broth, if necessary, 



98 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

until it is the desired consistency. Stir over the fire until it 
comes to a boil, skim, and season to taste. Just before serving, 
stir in one pint of boiling cream and two ounces of butter. 
Mix thoroughly. Add one pint of small green asparagus tops 
and serve. 

Cream of Spinach 

' Wash and boil half a peck of spinach in salted water. Drain 
and chop very fine. Put in a stewpan with two ounces of butter, 
salt, pepper, and a little grated nutmeg. Stir over the fire until 
the moisture is almost evaporated, stir in one ounce and a half 
of flour and three pints of boiled milk. When the mixture has 
boiled for a minute, remove from the fire, rub it twice through 
a fine sieve, and return to the pan. Stir and heat it well without 
boiling it. Add a little more butter and half a cup of cream. 
Serve with fried bread crumbs. 

Oatmeal Soup 

Boil together for an hour and a half enough oatmeal to make 
the water slightly thick or viscid. Add a lump of butter, 
enough sugar to sweeten slightly, a little wine, and drop in a bit 
of lemon peel. A good pinch of salt also should not be for- 
gotten. After the boiling strain through a sieve, boil up again, 
add cream and the beaten yolks of eggs to your taste, and serve 
with toast sippets. 

Split Pea Soup 

"^ In buying dried or split peas, be sure that they are not old 
and worm-eaten. Wash a pint of them clean and soak them 
over night in plenty of cold water. Put them on to boil with 
five pints of cold water and boil them till tender. Add, when 
the peas are tender, a couple of onions, or more if you wish, a 
couple of fine carrots grated, and a turnip or two sliced, if 
your taste so directs. These vegetables should be browned 
in butter before going to the peas. Add also pepper and salt 



SOUPS 99 

to taste. Stew all gently together till the vegetables will go 
through a sieve. After straining in this way put the soup 
back to boil and serve after a few minutes' boiling with half 
a dozen croutons floating in each plate. The hock of a ham 
or a piece of pork may be cooked with the peas for flavoring. 

Saratoga Soup 

Warm and strain one can of tomatoes, add half a cup of raw 
sago. Boil until the sago is clear. Add one pint of consomme. 
Salt and pepper to taste. If desired, a little Worcestershire may 
be added. 

Tomato Soup 

Heat and strain one can of tomatoes and add one quart of 
stock. Stir in one teaspoonful of corn-starch which has been 
blended in a little water. Stir constantly over the fire until 
just ready to boil. Season with salt, a little Worcestershire, 
and also a little mushroom catsup. 

Tomato Cream Soup 

Melt one good-sized lump of butter, stir in two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour. When mixed, add one pint of milk and one pint 
of cream. Let it boil. Scald one can of tomatoes, strain, and 
add to the soup a little at a time so it will not curdle the milk 
and cream. Add a very small pinch of sugar, season to taste. 
Strain through a wet cheese-cloth and serve very hot. 

Tomato Soup 

Empty one quart jar of tomatoes into an agate saucepan 
and add one pint of cold water. Stand the mixture over a 
quick fire. Next, mix together in another saucepan one heap- 
ing tablespoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour. 
When the tomatoes reach the boiling heat, pour them over the 
flour and butter in the other saucepan, stirring constantly to

keep it from lumping. Set the saucepan on the stove and 
season the mixture with a little grated onion, one heaping tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a little black pepper. Let the soup boil 
veri/ slowly for half an hour. Then press it through a puree 
sieve. Stand it back on the fire, add one teaspoonful of soda, 
and after a minute add one pint of rich cream. Let it boil one 
minute and then serve. 

Tomato Soup Maigre 

Fry to a good brown a sliced onion, — this in the bottom of 
a soup pot, — and over it pour a can of tomatoes, which have 
been well chopped, and two cups of boiling water. When the 
tomatoes are cooked tender, rub them through a colander, put 
the soup in the kettle, add a cup of boiled rice, thicken with a 
tablespoon of butter, rubbed smooth with the same amount of 
flour, boil up, and serve. 

Sorrel Soup 

Make a good strong bouillon, using marrow bones and bone 
meat preferably. Having carefully washed the sorrel leaves, 
chop them very fine, and cook till tender in a little of the 
bouillon. Add to them rich cream in the proportion of a 
tablespoon or two for each plate, bring to a boil, pour into the 
bouillon, and serve. 

Sometimes hard-boiled eggs are served with this soup. The 
eggs are cut in halves, fried in butter, and two halves laid in 
each soup plate.

Court Bouillon for all Sorts of Fresh Water Fish 

One pint of water, one quart of white wine, one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, a bunch of parsley, a few young onions, one clove 
of garlic, a bunch of thyme, one bay leaf, one carrot, and a 
blade of mace. Boil the fish in this bouillon, which will do 
for use several times. Any kind of fish, such as salmon, trout, 
pompano, sheepshead, carp, may be boiled in this way. Lob- 
ster boiled in court bouillon is very fine. 

Fish Forcemeat 

Take one pound of raw fish, — halibut, cod, pompano. 
Mortar it well and put it through a puree sieve. Weigh it ; 
there should be four ounces, good weight. Then add the beaten 
white of one egg. Set in a cool place. Melt one tablespoon- 
ful of butter with one of flour. When they come to a boil, 
add one cup milk, the yolk of one egg^ one tablespoonful 
cream. Season to taste. Cook until it thickens and is smooth, 
remove, and when cold add to your fish. 

Fish Forcemeat 

Take two ounces of fish free from skin, put in a mortar 
with two ounces of fresh butter, one ounce of bread crumbs, 
the yolks of two eggs boiled hard, and a little shallot, grated 
lemon peel, and minced parsley. Pound together till quite 
smooth, mix with salt, pepper, and the yolk and white of an 
egg, and it is ready for use.

Veal Forcemeat for Fish 

Soak four ounces of stale bread in water, squeeze it dry, 
and mix with four ounces of finely chopped cooked veal and 
two ounces of finely chopped salt pork and one tablespoonful 
of butter. Pound all in a mortar, then rub through a puree 
sieve, and add the following : the juice of half a lemon, half 
a teaspoonful of powdered thyme, half a teaspoonful of sweet 
marjoram, a little ground mace, a little salt and white pepper, 
and a well-beaten egg. This may be made in larger or smaller 
quantities, according to the size and number of the fish to be 
stuffed. 

Baked Bass 

Wash and clean a fresh bass for baking, leaving on the 
head. Stuff the fish with the following mixture : two and 
one-half cups of fine bread crumbs, one cup of butter, the rind 
of a quarter of a lemon chopped very fine, two or three sprigs 
of parsley chopped fine, and a little sweet marjoram. Season 
to taste with salt and white pepper. Mix two well-beaten 
eggs with a little water, and add to the mixture. AVhen the 
fish is well stuffed, sew up the opening. Score it on each side, 
and in the spaces place very thin slices of salt pork. Place it 
in a pan with a little stock, and bake in a moderate oven. 
Baste it frequently with the stock and a little seasoning. 
When thoroughly cooked, carefully place it on a hot dish. 

To the gravy which is left in the pan, add a little tomato 
sauce. Stir on the top of the range until it comes to a boil. 
Strain and serve in a separate dish. Garnish the fish plate with 
parsley and thin slices of lemon. 

Palmettes of Striped Bass 

Cut out six heart-shaped fillets from the thickest part of the 
bass. Season with pepper, salt, and the juice of half a lemon. 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 103 

Put under a press for one-half hour. Cook in clarified butter 
for ten minutes until a delicate brown. Make a forcemeat (the 
same as for fillet of pompano). Color the forcemeat pink and 
green, also have some white. Pour in three pastry bags. On 
the outside of each palmette put a pink border, on the inside 
all white with a small heart shape of green on the top. Set 
them away to get chilled. Have six pieces of heart-shaped oiled 
paper. Wrap up each palmette in one. Place them in a tin 
pan, set the pan over another which is half filled with water. 
Cook in the oven until the forcemeat is done, or from twenty 
to twenty-five minutes. Serve on corn-starch croustade and 
with Hollandaise sauce. 

Corn-starch Croustade 

Place one pint of milk in a saucepan over the fire, and when 
it boils add two heaping tablespoons of corn-starch, which has 
been dissolved in a little cold water, and one-half teaspoonful 
salt. When the mixture has cooked five minutes, add the white 
of an egg. Wet a mould about three-fourths or one inch deep 
of the desired shape and pour in the mixture. While hot it 
may be colored pink or green. Set away to cool. 

Baked Blueflsh 

Select a nice large bluefish, clean, and prepare it for baking. 
Wash it in salted water, and after drying it thoroughly, stuff 
it with veal forcemeat for fish, or else with bread forcemeat, to 
which a few capers have been added. Sew up the opening and 
rub the fish all over with salt. Then, having put small pieces 
of butter over it, place it in a large pan with enough water to 
cover the bottom, and bake in a hot oven for forty-five or fifty 
minutes. After it begins to bake, sprinkle it with a little salt 
and pepper. Baste it often with the liquid in the pan and a 
little melted butter. When it is cooked and a nice color, remove 



104 MES. 

carefully to a hot plate. Do not break it. Serve with a brown 
sauce, or any desired sauce poured round the fish as a garnish, 
or serve it in a separate dish. 

Slices of Cod a la Seville 

Wash and dry one-half pound of Carolina rice, fry it in hot 
olive oil, drain on a sieve, and then put it in a stewpan with 
some pieces of fresh cod cut in pieces about four inches square, 
and which have been fried in olive oil and drained. Cut a 
Spanish onion in very thin slices, and also fry the slices in oil. 
Mix them with six ripe tomatoes from which the skins and seeds 
have been removed. Cook the onion and tomato slowly for five 
minutes, then pour it over the fish and rice. Season with a 
little cayenne, salt, and lemon juice. Moisten with one pint of 
white broth, place a buttered paper on top, cover with the lid 
of the pan, and place in the oven to bake. In about half an 
hour the fish and rice will be done. Remove the pieces of fish 
and with a wooden spoon stir the rice over the fire in order to 
mix it with the seasoning. Arrange the rice on a dish and 
place the pieces of codfish on it. Garnish with tomato sauce 
or mussel sauce. 

Shredded Cod baked with Cream Sauce 

Boil four or five pounds of fresh cod. When cooked, drain 
and shred in fine pieces and set away to cool. Make the fol- 
lowing sauce for a five-pound piece of fish. Boil one quart of 
milk with one onion and a little finely chopped parsley. Set it 
aside. Mix one cup of butter with enough flour to absorb it. 
Add this to the milk and boil until it is the consistency of 
custard. Season with a dash of cayenne and salt to taste. Put 
a layer of shredded fish in a baking dish, cover with a layer of 
sauce, then a layer of fish, and so on until the dish is filled. 
Have the last layer of cream. Cover with fine bread crumbs. 



FISR, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS^ TERRAPIN 105 

Sprinkle with pieces of butter and bake in the oven until the 
top is a nice brown. Small boiled potato balls covered with 
cream sauce should be served with this. 



Baked Cod 

Select a fresh cod, cut off the head and fins, draw, wash, and 
split it down the belly. Remove the bone from the thick part 
only, and make small lengthwise incisions in the skin in order 
to prevent the fish from curling while it is cooking. Put it to 
soak for three hours in a dressing made as follows : salt, white 
pepper, a little Worcestershire sauce, and some sweet oil. Drain 
and place in a pan. Baste it with melted butter and sprinkle 
with fine bread crumbs. Moisten with two glasses of white 
wine and one pint of oyster liquor. Bake in a slow oven and 
then cover with a buttered paper and bake a light brown in a 
moderate oven. Drain and thicken the liquid with a little flour 
kneaded with butter, add some lemon juice and finely chopped 
parsley. Pour this round the fish and serve. 

Baked Cod's Head 

Wash and thoroughly clean a cod's head. Stuff the gills 
with veal forcemeat. Place the head in a pan, season with salt, 
white pepper, and a little chopped parsley. Mix one pint of 
stock, a scant pint of Sherry wine, and a little tomato catsup, 
and pour into the pan. Cover the fish with buttered paper and 
bake in a moderate oven. The fish must be well basted while 
it is cooking. When the head is nearly cooked, sprinkle it with 
fine bread crumbs. The average sized head should bake in one 
hour and a quarter. Mix the liquor in the pan with two gills 
of brown sauce, strain it, and add two ounces of butter and a 
little lemon juice. Boil for four minutes and then pour over 
the fish or serve in separate dish.

Codfish a la Mode 



Take one teacup of salt codfish picked up fine, two teacups 
of mashed potatoes, one pint of cream or milk. Mix them well 
together and then add two eggs well beaten. Stir them in 
thoroughly and then add a half cup of butter, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Put in a baking dish and bake twenty or 
thirty minutes. 

Colonial Codfish Pie, with Crust 

Line a deep baking dish with a biscuit crust. To make the 
crust, sift together four cups of flour, one heaping teaspoon of 
soda, and two teaspoons of cream of tartar (or in place of these 
three heaping teaspoons of baking powder), and one teaspoon of 
salt. In this rub one-half a cup of shortening and about a pint 
of milk, that is, enough to make a medium soft dough. In rolling 
out the upper crust spread butter on twice and fold and roll out. 

Take a pint of picked-up salt codfish, cover it with boiling 
water, let it stand two minutes and drain. Pour on more water 
and, after it has stood, drain dry. Upon the crust of your bak- 
ing dish put a layer of this codfish, sprinkle it with bread 
crumbs, pepper (a little salt if you find the fish fresh), small 
pieces of butter, and some cream sauce (made by thickening one 
pint of boiling milk with two teaspoons of flour and seasoning 
with salt and pepper). Break over the fish bread crumbs and 
seasoning, three or four eggs, carefully preserving the yolks. 
Repeat these layers, — codfish, bread crumbs, cream sauce, and 
eggs, — put on the top crust, cut a few holes in the centre to let 
out the steam, and bake till the crust is a delicate brown. 

Codfish Balls 

Trim and soak a piece of salt codfish in cold water for six 
or seven hours, and during that time change the water two or 
three times. Shred it. Should it be too salt after shredding, 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 107 

freshen it by frequent changes of cold water. There should be 
one quart bowl of the shredded fish. Cover it with water and let 
it simmer gently until tender. It will not take very long. 
Should you boil it too much, you might harden it. Have ready 
six good-sized, fresh-boiled potatoes, and mash them while hot. 
Have the fish drained, pounded, and rubbed through a sieve, 
and mix with the potatoes and three well-beaten eggs. Season 
to taste with salt — if necessary — and white pepper, also a 
small lump of butter. Drop by the tablespoonful into a pan of 
boiling hot lard and fry until a delicate brown. Drain on 
brown paper and serve very hot. 

Maigre Fish Pie 

Have ready plenty of salt codfish boiled and free from bones 
and skin. Have ready also four hard-boiled eggs and four 
onions. Peal and slice the eggs and onions very thin. Line the 
bottom of a deep pie dish with fish forcemeat or a layer of boiled 
potatoes sliced thin. On this put a layer of onions, then a 
layer of fish, then of eggs, and so on till the dish is full. Season 
each layer with a little pepper, and pour over the layers a gill 
of water containing a teaspoon of made mustard, a teaspoon of 
the essence of anchovy, and a little mushroom catsup. Break 
in small bits over the top an ounce of fresh butter. Cover all 
with a puff paste and bake one hour. For this dish fresh fish 
may be used by adding a little salt. 

Salt Mackerel 

Soak salt mackerel about forty-eight hours, changing the 
water once, then put it in a pan, cover with cream or the richest 
milk. Put in the oven and cook until cream is brown. 

Pompano Fillets a la Duchesse 

Cut fillets — as many as you wish — from a nice pompano. 
Put them on a platter and season with half a teaspoon of salt, 



108 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

one-fourth a teaspoon of pepper, and the juice of half an onion. 
Rub the fish well with the pepper and salt. Squeeze the onion 
juice over the fillets through a fine cloth, and let them stand 
one hour. Wipe dry. Put some fish forcemeat in a tube, and 
in fanciful forms press it over the fillets. Put a star cut from 
a truffle on top of each. Wrap each in piece of oiled paper. 
Place them in a tin pan, set the pan over another which is 
half filled with water. Bake in the oven until the forcemeat 
is done, or from twenty to twenty-five minutes. Serve with 
duchesse sauce. 

Stuffed Pompano with Lobster 

Select a fresh pompano, clean and wash it, and having re- 
moved the head and tail, reserve them for future use. Split 
the fish as for broiling and remove the bone. Boil a small 
lobster weighing about one and a half pounds. When cool 
remove the meat, saving the coral. Pound the meat in a mor- 
tar and rub it through a puree sieve. Mix it with a small cup 
of cream sauce, two well-beaten eggs, one tablespoonful of 
flour. Season with salt, white pepper, and if desired a dash 
of nutmeg. Lastly, stir in a small cup of cream and a table- 
spoonful of Sherry. Mix thoroughly. Lay the split pompano 
in a pan, skin side down, and on each half smoothly spread the 
lobster forcemeat. Garnish the fish with truffles cut in fancy 
shapes, finely chopped truffles, hard-boiled eggs, — the whites 
and yolks chopped separately, — and the coral of the lobster 
cut in strips. Pour a little salted water in the pan, cover the 
fish with buttered paper, and steam in hot oven for half an 
hour. When done, place on a hot dish on a bed of green 
celery cut in strips like grass. Decorate the head and tail 
and replace on fish. Put a few shrimps around the dish, on the 
celery, and serve with a shrimp sauce. Bass may be served in 
this way. The fish, when prettily garnished, is very pleasing

Boiled Red Snapper 

Clean and scale a fresh red snapper which will weigh about 
five or six pounds. Wash it in cold water. Have as much 
water in the kettle as will cover your fish. Add vinegar, salt, 
and lemon juice. To four quarts of water add one and a half 
tablespoons of lemon juice, two tablespoons of salt, and one 
tablespoon of vinegar. When the water comes to a boil, push 
it to the back of the range. Add a pint of cold water, then 
put your fish in and move the kettle to the front. Just as 
soon as the water comes to a boil, place the kettle where the 
contents will just bubble. Let it cook in this way for half an 
hour. When cooked, drain thoroughly and serve with Hollan- 
daise or any sauce suitable for the fish. 

Baked Red Snapper, with Forcemeat 

Select a red snapper weighing about five pounds. Cut off 
the fins, scale it, and prepare it for baking. Stuff it with the 
following mixture : One pint of medium-sized oysters, chopped 
very fine, one-half cup of powdered cracker crumbs, one gener- 
ous tablespoonful of butter, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of 
white pepper, one-half teaspoonful of onion juice, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and one teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley. Mix 
together thoroughly. Rub the fish inside and out with one 
tablespoonful of salt. When it is stuffed, sew up the opening 
and place it on a buttered sheet of tin. Place the tin in a pan 
with about a pint of boiling water and bake in hot oven for 
about one hour. 

Have the following sauce prepared to baste the fish with : 
Heat two tablespoon fuls of butter, then add two tablespoonfuls 
of flour. Stir until it is brown. Then gradually add one pint 
of cold water. Let this boil for five minutes and keep it hot. 
Pour about one-quarter of this sauce over the fish. Dredge 
it with salt, pepper, and a little flour. Repeat this in ten 



FISH, OYSTEBS, LOBSTERS, TERBAPIN 111 

two ounces of butter. Let it come to a boil, then cover and 
simmer for one-half hour. Drain the fish and remove the 
bunch of parsley. Thicken the liquid with one ounce of flour 
which has been cooked in butter. Boil ten minutes, then mix 
with the yolks of four eggs and some chopped parsley. Spread 
a thin layer of thick mashed potatoes in an oval baking dish, 
well buttered. Remove the bone and skin from the steaks and 
place them one overlapping the other on the potatoes. Fill 
with more potatoes, smooth nicely, and pour the sauce over all. 
Sprinkle with bread crumbs and little pieces of butter over 
the top. Bake until a light brown, in a moderate oven, about 
twenty minutes. Serve in the baking dish. 

Fillets of Salmon a la Venitienne 

Take the fillets from a four-pound tail-piece of salmon. 
Remove the skin and cut each one in four long pieces. Flatten 
and trim evenly. Fasten fine strips of larding pork on one 
side, season with salt, white pepper, and a little lemon juice, 
and place the larded side up in a buttered pan. Moisten with 
half a pint of white wine, and cover with a sheet of buttered 
paper with a small hole in the centre. The steam must have 
vent, else the surface will not glaze. Cook in the oven about 
forty minutes, basting frequently with the liquid in order to 
have the glaze a nice color. Drain and dish the fillets in a 
circle with alternate heart-shaped slices of bread fried in but- 
ter. Thicken two ladlefuls of broth with one ounce of flour 
kneaded in butter. Stir and boil a few minutes. Add two 
ounces of butter, a little lemon juice, and chopped parsley. 
Mix well and pour in centre of dish. 

Salmon Mousse a la Martinet 

Have a slice of raw salmon, scrape so it will be free from 
sinews, put it in a mortar and pound to a pulp, and put through 
a fine puree sieve. Then weigh it. There should be eight 



112 MBS. seely's cook book 

ounces, good weight. Place in a bowl and gradually add the 
beaten white of two eggs, stirring constantly with a wooden 
pestle. Make a sauce of the following : One tablespoonful 
melted butter, one tablespoonful flour. Let them come to a 
boil. Add one cupful milk, two tablespoonfuls of mushroom 
liquor, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of 
white pepper, a pinch of cayenne, and juice of one onion. 
Cook all together five minutes, add the yolks of three eggs and 
two tablespoons of cream. Do not let the sauce boil after the 
yolks have been added. When the sauce commences to thicken, 
remove and set away to cool. When cold, add it to the fish. 
Rub all well together and put on ice for half an hour. Then 
add half a pint of whipped cream. Butter your mould, decorate 
it with truffles. Put on ice to harden, so the decoration will 
be firm on mould. Fill the mould with fish, giving it a few 
knocks on the table to settle the forcemeat. Thirty minutes 
before serving put your mould in a pan, pour hot water halfway 
to mould, put a buttered paper on top, and poach in a moderate 
oven until firm to the touch. When ready to serve, dip your 
mould in cold water, lay the dish you are going to serve it in 
on top of mould. Turn very gently and lift off the mould. 
Serve with Martinot sauce in centre or in sauce-boat. 

Baked Salmon Trout 

Carefully clean, wash, and thoroughly dry a fresh salmon 
trout. Spread it full length, head and tail included, in a bak- 
ing pan, with just enough water to keep it from scorching. If 
a very large one, score the backbone, but be careful not to mar 
the sides. Bake very slowly in a moderate oven, basting often 
with butter and water. When it is done, remove to a hot dish. 
Have ready in a saucepan a cup of cream diluted with a few 
spoonfuls of hot water, and mix carefully with two tablespoons 
of melted butter and a little finely chopped parsley. Heat this 
in a pan with boiling water underneath it. Add the gravy 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 113 

from the pan the fish was cooked in. Boil up once to thicken. 
Pour this sauce around the trout or serve in a separate dish. 
Garnish the fish with sprigs of parsley. The fish should have 
almost the same colored spots as when uncooked. If necessary, 
season with a little salt. 

Broiled Shad a I'Abbe with Herb Sauce 

Get one large roe shad and an extra shad roe. Prepare the 
fish for broiling, taking the roe and keeping it with the other 
until wanted. Remove the bone of the fish, clean nicely, wash 
and wipe dry. Make small incisions on both sides of the fish 
and soak it for one hour in a dish with salt, pepper, olive 
oil, and lemon juice. See that it soaks on both sides. Drain, 
sprinkle with bread crumbs, and broil slowly for one-half hour. 
See that your broiler is well greased. Make eight pieces out 
of your roes and also have eight large oysters. Dip them in 
beaten Qgg and roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot fat until a 
nice brown. Dish up the shad, surround with roes and oysters, 
and serve with an herb sauce. 

Herb Sauce 

Place two chopped shallots in a saucepan with a little but- 
ter, salt, white pepper, grated nutmeg, and a glass of white 
wine. Boil until it is reduced one-half. Add half a pint of 
veloute sauce and boil a minute. Thicken with three Qgg 
yolks and as much water as you have Qgg yolks, mix water 
and yolks together, and stir without boiling. Then add care- 
fully four ounces of butter in small bits, stirring all the while. 
Finish with chopped parsley and lemon juice. 

Planked Shad 

Have a hardwood board about one inch and a half thick. 
Split the shad as for broiling, tack it on the board, skin side 
down, and roast before the fire until done. Every once in a 



114 MBS. SEELY'S cook BOOK 

while rub it with a little butter. Before placing the shad on 
the board, see that the board is well seasoned and heated, else 
the fish will have the flavor of the wood. When cooked, place 
it on a hot dish, season with salt and pepper, cover with small 
bits of butter, and serve with lemon cut in quarters. 

Baked Shad Roe 

Pare the roes of four large shad, sprinkle a baking dish with 
chopped onion, parsley, and mushrooms. Add the roes, strew 
over them more onion, etc., with salt, pepper, a little nutmeg, 
and small bits of butter. Moisten with a little white broth and 
two glasses of white wine. Let all cook and boil in the oven, 
basting occasionally, for twenty minutes. Drain and thicken 
the liquid with one tablespoonful of flour kneaded in butter. 
Pour this over the roes, sprinkle with fine bread crumbs, put 
small bits of butter on top, and bake in brisk oven ten minutes 
longer. Press lemon juice over and serve in the baking dish. 
The above is enough for eight persons. 

Shad Roe Cromeskies 

Wash thoroughly in cold water the roe of a shad and 
remove the skin hanging to it. Wipe it well and cut it in 
pieces of a size to wrajD well in thin slices of bacon. Rub the 
pieces of shad with salt and pepper. Lay them in the slices of 
bacon, wrap the bacon round, and tie with fine twdne. Have 
care that the bacon is not too thick. Drop each piece in deep 
hot fat and fry a light brown. Garnish with parsley and serve 
with a piquant sauce. 

Roast Shad with Sauce 

Have a large roe shad, scale, draw by the gills, cleanse 
nicely, and wipe dry. Make small crosswise incisions on both 
sides. Put the fish on a dish to soak for one hour w^ith salt, 
pepper, olive oil, lemon juice, chopped parsley, chives, and 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 115 

thyme. Be sure to turn and press it often so it will {ibsorb the 
seasoning. Put on the spit or on a long skewer, if to roast in the 
oven, wrap in double oiled paper, making it secure by pressing 
down a shorter skewer along each side and tying at each end. 
Then roast before the fire, or in a moderate oven for forty min- 
utes. Remove the paper, brown a nice color. Place on dish, 
pour sauce round it, and serve. 

Shad Sauce 

Four shallots, chopped very fine. Put them in a saucepan 
with two ounces butter and four tablespoonfuls of white wine 
vinegar. Let it boil down to half the original quantity, then 
add one pint veloute sauce. Boil a little longer, add finely 
chopped parsley, tarragon, and about four ounces of butter in 
small bits. Mix thoroughly. 

Boiled Brook Trout (hot) 

Scale and prepare four large trout. Pour over them two 
breakfast cups of boiling vinegar, which will turn the meat 
blue, two breakfast cups of white wine, and enough water to 
cover them. Add one onion with three cloves stuck in it, one 
carrot, half a bunch of celery, four or five bay leaves, one small 
bunch of parsley, one teaspoonful of peppercorns, and salt 
to suit the taste. Boil all together for fifteen minutes in a 
covered saucepan. When done remove the fish, drain them, 
place them on a folded napkin spread on a dish. Garnish 
with parsley. Serve with any fish sauce, or with oil or vinegar. 

Boiled Brook Trout (cold) 

Clean four or more small trout. Place them in a saucepan 
with enough claret to cover them. Add a slice of lemon, two 
whole cloves, four whole peppers, a little bit of mace, and a 
heaping saltspoon of salt. Let it cook and simmer very slowly 



116 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

for three-quarters of an hour. Remove from the fire, and 
when cold take out the fish. Place them in a dish and pour 
the boiled wine over them. Serve at once. 

Broiled Trout 

Scale and clean a trout. Wash and dry it well. Gash it 
across the back, and in the openings put some butter which has 
been seasoned with finely chopped chives and parsley, a little 
lemon juice, and thyme. Put the trout in a dish, season with 
a little salt and pepper and olive oil. Let it soak for about 
half an hour. Remove from the dish. Sprinkle with bread 
crumbs mixed with a few chopped herbs and then arrange on 
a well-greased gridiron. Broil over a clear fire for fifteen 
minutes or so until it is done. Turn the gridiron often and 
be sure not to burn the fish. Place on a hot dish and serve 
with any desired sauce in a separate dish. 

Fried Trout, Mountain Style 

Clean and wash a trout weighing a quarter or half a pound. 
Dry it thoroughly. Cut some salt pork in small pieces and 
place in a frying pan. When the fat is tried out, remove the 
pork. Rub the inside of the fish with a little salt. When 
the pork fat is very hot, place the fish in the pan. Turn it 
two or three times. Serve on a very hot dish. If you have 
a little fresh butter, a little may be put on the fish, but avoid 
sauces and condiments. 

Baked Brook Trout, with Forcemeat 

Select trout weighing a pound or more. Open them just 
enough to clean them properly, removing the gills and leaving 
the heads on. Wash and dry them thoroughly, and fill the 
cavities with the following forcemeat : Half a pint of bread 
crumbs soaked in a little milk, squeezed dry, and mixed with 
two ounces of good butter, one saltspoon of salt, one-half a 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 117 

saltspoon of white pepper, juice of quarter of a lemon, a little 
sprig of thyme, and the yoke of one raw egg. Mix thoroughly. 
Sew up the openings. Place the fish in a pan ; on top of each 
one place small bits of butter which have previously been 
rolled in flour. Place in the oven with the backs toward the 
hottest part. They should cook in twenty or thirty minutes. 
Sometimes it takes longer, for it depends upon the heat of the 
oven. 

Fillets of Sole a la Venitienne 

Take the fillets of four soles, trim and place one-half of 
them in a saucepan with some clarified butter, a little lemon 
juice, white pepper, and salt. Let them simmer slowly for ten 
minutes. Simmer the other fillets without trimming them in 
the same manner. When they are done, drain them and set away 
to cool. Cut the untrimmed fillets into small dice. Mix them 
with some thick Allemande sauce, two ounces of grated Parme- 
san cheese, white pepper and salt to taste, and a dash of grated 
nutmeg. Spread this preparation about one-sixth of an inch 
thick on an earthen dish, and when it has become firm cut it 
into pieces about the size and shape of the fillets. Roll them 
in fine bread crumbs, then in beaten egg, and then again in 
bread crumbs. Just before serving warm the fillets, fry the 
croquettes in hot lard, drain both on a piece of brown paper. 
Arrange them in a close circle, placing alternately the cro- 
quettes and the fillets. Fill the centre with small fish force- 
meat balls, fried in hot lard. Pour some Venitienne sauce in 
the centre and on the fillets and serve. 

Sole Normande, with Sauce 

Butter a tin very quickly. Boil some onions in water to 
remove the strong flavor, then slice them very thin and lay 
them on the butter. Place the sole on them. Put over it 
salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste, also some chopped parsley. 



118 MRS. seely's cook book 

Add the juice of one lemon and as much white wine as will 
cover it. Place them in a slow oven for thirty minutes. Baste 
the sole with its own liquor very often, and add more butter if 
required. Serve with fried bread sippets and a sauce made 
from the gravy in which the fish has been cooked. 

How to make the Sauce 

Melt a tablespoonful of butter in saucepan and add a table- 
spoonful of flour. Strain the gravy from the pan in which the 
fish has been cooked. Add a full cup of it to the butter and 
flour. Let it come to a boil, then cook five minutes. Season 
to taste, add one-half cup of rich cream. Serve ver^ hot in 
sauce-boat. 

Fillet of Sole 

Take two soles, divide them from the backbone, remove the 
heads, fins, and tails. Sprinkle the inside with pepper, salt, 
and the juice of half a lemon. Roll in the shape of a cork- 
screw, then roll them in egg^ then fresh bread crumbs, then 
in egg^ and bread crumbs again. Fry in hot fat and serve on 
a napkin. Garnish with lemon baskets filled with Tartare 
sauce and sprigs of parsley. 

Fillet of Sole 

Cut off the head and tail of a large flounder and set away 
for future use. Cut off the fillets from the fish and bake them 
in the oven for ten minutes and set them away to cool. Then 
make a puree of mushrooms in the following way : Peel and 
chop fine one pound of mushrooms, melt one ounce of butter, add 
one ounce of flour, and let them come to a boil. Then stir in 
one-half cup consomme, half a cup of cream, and the mushrooms, 
and boil for five minutes. Then set the mixture away to cool. 
Make a forcemeat of halibut or any kind of fish desired. Now 
lay the fish fillets on a platter, cover each one with the mush- 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 119 

room puree, and then with tlie forcemeat. Put the head and 
tail in place. Set the platter in a pan of hot water and bake 
in a moderate oven for ten minutes. Remove carefully to a 
platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with Hollandaise sauce. 

Chartreuse of Fish a la Hauraise 

Take some nice fillets of sole, put them on a buttered baking 
tin. Season them with salt, pepj^er, and a little lemon juice. 
Cover them with a thick buttered paper and cook them in a 
moderate oven for six or eight minutes. Then take up the 
fillets and put them to press until cold. Cut them out with 
a plain round cutter, ornament half of them with coral 
(lobster's), and the other half with tarragon and parsley and 
truffle. Set the garnish with a little liquid aspic jelly. Line 
the Chartreuse mould with aspic jelly and arrange the rounds 
of sole all over the mould. Set this with aspic, just enough to 
make the garnish firm, and in the centre place the following 
mixture : — 

Take about half a pint of picked shrimps or lobsters, cut 
in dice shapes, two peeled tomatoes, four artichoke bottoms 
(cooked and cold), and twelve small raw oysters. Add season- 
ing and red pepper and trimmings of sole. Mix all with half 
pint of liquid aspic jelly and two large tablespoonfuls of thick 
Mayonnaise sauce. Stir all together on ice till it begins to set, 
then pour into the mould as directed. Let it stand an hour or 
more, turn out on stand, and garnish with jelly.

over them or in a separate dish. 

Broiled Smelts 

Split and clean as many smelts as are required. Select large 
ones. Remove tlie backbone, rub each one with olive oil, and 
season with a little salt and pepper. Grease the broiler, ar- 
range the smelts on it, and broil on each side for two or three 
minutes. Serve with a Bearnaise sauce. 

Fried Smelts a la Parisienne 

Wash the smelts thoroughly, cut down the back, and take the 
bone out a little below the head and just above the tail. Clean 
well and cut away the fins and gills. Dry well and flour them. 
Roll them up by putting their tails in their mouths and fasten- 
ing them with a little wooden skewer. Set away in the ice- 
box. Have your oil or fat very hot. Fry, a few at a time, 
until a nice brown. Keep in warm place until all are fried, 
then let your oil get very hot. Put all in your frying basket, 
plunge into your hot fat. They will swell up and be a beauti- 
ful brown and crisp. Boil the number of eggs required, allow- 
ing one-half for each person. Take out the yolks and put the 
whites in cold water. Make a Tartare sauce. When ready to 
serve, fill each half egg with Tartare sauce and put round the 
fish. Put a bunch of parsley between each egg. Serve the 
fish very hot.

and pieces of butter, and bake in hot oven for twenty minutes. 
When cooked sprinkle with the juice of a lemon and serve in 
the baking dish. 

Stuffed Smelts 

Remove the fins from two dozen large smelts. Clean them 
without splitting them and stuff with a fish forcemeat — a 
paper cornucopia must be used. Place the fish on a well-but- 
tered dish, cover them with one pint of Italienne sauce, and 
bake in a hot oven for ten minutes. Squeeze some lemon juice 
over them and serve in the same dish. 

Smelt Croquettes 

Select as many medium-sized fresh smelts as you desire to 
serve. Clean and prepare them as you would for broiling, 
removing backbone, dry them, and set in cool place. Boil one 
pound of halibut, pound it fine, then add a little Sherry, white 
pepper and salt to taste. Beat in enough cream sauce to ena- 
ble you to form the mixture into small croquettes. Roll a 
smelt around each one, fastening it by sticking the head 
through the tail. Roll in beaten egg and fine bread crumbs 
and fry in hot lard. Drain on thick brown paper. Arrange a 
lemon basket in the centre of a dish, around it place the smelts 
and garnish border with half of the whites of hard-boiled eggs, 
each filled with Tartare sauce. 

Turbot a la Creme

the water over them. Drain them well and soak in milk for 
thirty minutes. Drain and wipe dry. Dredge with flour and 
roll in crumbs. Set in ice-box until wanted. Have some hot 
olive oil or clarified drippings. Put in wire basket a handful at 
a time and as soon as they rise they are done, which will be less 
than one minute. Continue frying till all are done, keeping 
the fried ones hot. AVhen all are fried let the fat get very hot, 
put all of them in wire basket and plunge in fat for a minute 
or two. Take out, dredge with salt, and serve very hot with 
Tartare sauce. Brown bread is always served with this fish. 

Baked Whitefish 

Season some fillets of whitefish with salt and white pepper. 
Dip them in beaten egg^ then in bread crumbs, then in egg, 
then in bread crumbs again, and lastly in beaten egg. Heat a 
good-sized lump of lard in a baking dish, add the fillets, and 
bake in the oven for twenty-five minutes. Have them baked a 
light brown. Drain thoroughly, serve on hot dish with fried 
parsley as a garnish, and serve cream sauce with finely chopped 
parsley in a separate dish. 

Eels fried in Batter

on paper and serve very hot with a brown or tomato sauce. 



FISH, OYSTERS, LOBSTERS, TERRAPIN 123 

Baked Eel with Tartare Sauce 

Skin two fat eels, each weighing about one and a half 
pounds. Cut off the fins, heads, and tails. Clean them thor- 
oughly and tie them together so as to shape them on a round 
platter. Wrap them in a wet cloth and cook slowly in court 
bouillon for fifteen minutes. Set aside and let them cool in 
the liquor. Season about one pint of fine bread crumbs with 
one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. Carefully 
remove the cloth from the fish, wipe dry, and cover them with 
the bread crumbs. Then spread them with a mixture of two 
well-beaten eggs and one tablespoonful of olive oil. Sprinkle 
once more with bread crumbs. Place them in a baking pan, 
being particular to keep the circular shape. Add two and a 
half tablespoonfuls of butter. Bake in moderate oven for half 
an hour. Baste them three times. Place on a circular dish. 
In the centre place green peppers filled with Tartare sauce 
after you have removed the core and seeds from peppers, soaked 
them in cold water, drained thoroughly, and then filled them 
with the sauce. 

Canapes of Meat or Fish 

Toast six pieces of bread and cut them in good-sized 
squares. Beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, put

of two eggs with the juice of half a lemon. Stir into the 
sauce. Then add the oysters and serve very hot. 

Fried Oysters 

Select large oysters, clean, and parboil slightly to draw out 
some of the water. Drain and dry on a towel. Roll in fine 
bread or cracker crumbs, dip in mayonnaise dressing, then in 
crumbs again. Let them stand five minutes, and if they seem 
moist, dip again in crumbs, and cook in deep hot fat for one 
minute. Being already cooked, they only need to be thor- 
oughly heated and the crumbs browned. 

Scalloped Oysters 

Clean one pint of medium-sized oysters. Moisten one tea- 
cup of cracker crumbs with one-third of a cup of melted butter. 
Spread one-fourth of the crumbs in a baking dish, over them

Stuffed Oysters 

Have at hand twenty-eight large oysters and some chicken 
forcemeat prepared as follows : Scrape and pound the breast of 
an uncooked medium-sized fowl, then rub it through a puree 
sieve. Mix one-quarter of a cup of cream or milk with one- 
eighth of a cup of fine bread crumbs. Cook them slowly until 
they form a smooth paste. Then add the chicken, the white 
of one egg, one tablespoonful of butter, one-half teaspoonful 
of salt, a bit of white pepper. Mix all together thoroughly 
and set away to cool. Dry the oysters thoroughly and season 
them with salt and pepper. Roll them in bread crumbs. 
Arrange the forcemeat in half as many pieces as you have 
oysters and at a corresponding size. Place a piece on fourteen 
oysters, cover with the remaining oysters. Press them together 
so they will stick. Take one whole egg and the yolk left from 
the forcemeat. Beat it well, season with a little salt. Dip 
each oyster in the egg, then roll them in bread crumbs. Have 
them well covered with egg and crumbs. Fry in hot fat until 
a good color. Drain on brown paper and serve very hot with 
Madeira sauce in a separate dish. 

Broiled Oysters

with four ounces of butter and half a pint of Madeira wine. 
Boil down until nearly dry. Mix the yolks of six eggs with 
one pint of cream, a little salt and a pinch of cayenne, six 
ounces of butter, and the eggs from the terrapin. Stir in 
the terrapin and stir steadily over a brisk fire until the sauce 
thickens. It must not boil. Serve immediately with quar- 
tered lemons. 

Terrapin a la Chamberlin 

Put a female terrapin in boiling water for five minutes, to 
loosen the skin, then take it out, skin it, and replace it in the 
hot water. When the claws are soft, it is sufficiently boiled. 
Take it out and remove the bottom shell first. Cut off the 
head and claws, and take out the gall and sand bag, then cut 
up the remainder. Cut up the entrails and all about half an 
inch long. Be careful to preserve all the juice. Put in a stew- 
pan. Make a dressing of flour, the yolks of two hard-boiled 
eggs, a third of a pound of the very best butter, a proper pro- 
portion of salt, red pepper, a small quantity of rich cream, and 
a large wine-glass of Madeira or Sherry to each terrapin. All 
of the ingredients to be of the best qualities. Dish promptly 
and serve smoking hot.

MEATS 
Broiled Steak 

When broiling, be sure to have a clear red bed of coals. 
Grease the wires of your broiler and place your steak on it. 
Hold each side over the extreme heat for a minute at a time, 
continue this for four or five minutes. Then hold the broiler 
farther away from the coals and keep turning the steak every 
minute or two until steak is cooked. Remove to a platter, sea- 
son with salt and pepper. Sprinkle generously with pieces of 
butter. When the butter is melted, serve plain, or with any 
sauce desired. The length of time a steak should be broiled 
depends entirely upon its thickness. A steak one inch and a 
half thick will cook underdone, or rare, in seven or eight min- 
utes. Should you have a steak two and a half or three inches 
thick, it is a good plan to begin cooking it in front of the coals. 
The centre cooks, then it can be finished over the coals. 

Broiled Fillet of Beef 

Cut three and one-half pounds of the tenderloin of beef in 
slices about three-quarters of an inch thick. Season with salt 
and pepper. Broil for five or six minutes and serve with a 
garnish of hot Bearnaise sauce. 

Larded Steak 

Take a piece of sirloin beef Aveighing four or five pounds. 
Cut out the bones, trim it, and lard it on one side with fine 
strips of larding pork. Season with salt and pepper. Cover 

143 



144 MRS. seelt's cook book 

the bottom of a baking dish with a piece of pork skin, add one 
thinly sliced carrot, one sprig of thyme, one bay leaf, and one 
sliced onion. Place the beef on top, and bake in the oven for 
half an hour. Place on a dish and keep warm. Add one-half 
pint of consomme to the drippings. Boil two or three minutes. 
Skim off the grease and strain into a separate dish. Serve 
very hot. 

Stuffed Beefsteak 

Select a good-sized rump steak, about half an inch thick. 
Make some bread forcemeat and spread it over the steak, and 
roll all together and tie securely. Place it on a tin sheet set 
a little up from the bottom of a kettle. Pour in enough water 
to nearly cover it. Place the kettle where the meat will stew 
slowly for two or three hours. Serve with any sauce you may 
wish, and carve crosswise through the stuffing and meat. 

Beefsteak with Fried Onions 

Put a kettle of fat on the range where it will heat. Peel 
and thinly slice two Spanish onions. Place them in a frying 
basket. Broil the steak as previously directed. When the 
meat is cooked, move the kettle forward, and when the fat is 
very hot, plunge the basket of onions into it. Cook until crisp 
and a nice brown. Drain and arrange them round the steak, or 
in a separate dish, if wished. 

Roast Beef 

A great deal depends upon the weight and quality of a piece 
of beef in determining how long it should be cooked. One 
commonly allows nine minutes to the pound for a rib or loin 
roast if it is to be rare, and twelve minutes to the pound if you 
wish it an even red all the way through. A roast cut from the 
round or rump will take forty minutes longer than the first- 
named cuts. Rub the top and sides of the beef with salt and 
pepper, put a few small pieces of butter over the top, and place 



MEATS 145 

it in a dripping pan. Pour about two tablespoonfuls of hot 
water in the, pan, and put in hot oven with a steady heat. 
Baste frequently while the beef is cooking. If the top burn, 
open the oven door a little. When cooked, place on a hot plat- 
ter. Sprinkle flour in a dripping pan, stir constantly, and add 
enough boiling water to make the gravy or sauce the right 
thickness. Strain and serve in separate dish. Any other sauce 
may be served with the above. Sometimes the platter is gar- 
nished with potatoes which have been roasted in the pan with 
the beef. If so, do as follows: Select and peel medium-sized 
potatoes. About half or three-quarters of an hour before the 
beef is served, cut the potatoes in two lengthwise, and place in 
the pan around the beef. Turn and baste them frequently. 
If desired, garnish dish with Yorkshire pudding made as 

follows : — 

Yorkshire Pudding 

Have at hand one and one-half pints of milk, six large 
tablespoonfuls of flour, three eggs, and one saltspoonful of salt. 
Put the flour and salt in a bowl, and stir gradually to this 
enough milk to make a stiff batter. When this is perfectly 
smooth and all the lumps are dissolved, add the remainder of 
the milk and a well-beaten egg. Whisk the mixture and pour 
it into a well-buttered, shallow tin. Bake for an hour. Then 
for another half hour, place it in the pan underneath the meat, 
so that it will catch a little of the juice from it. Cut the pud- 
ding in small, square pieces, put them on a hot dish, and serve. 
If the meat is baked, the pudding may at once be placed under it. 

Beef Pie 

Cut four and one-half pounds of sirloin beef in thin slices, 
season with salt and pepper, and arrange in a deep baking dish 
which is well buttered. Place first a layer of meat, then a layer 
of choj)ped parsley, mushrooms, shallots, and a ladlef ul of thick 
brown gravy, and so on until the dish is full. Wet the edge of 



146 

the dish, cover it with a rim of puff paste, wet again, and cover 
the whole with a large, thin piece of paste. Press the edges 
closely together. Brush the top with a beaten egg, make a few 
incisions, and a hole in the centre. Bake in a moderate oven 
for one hour. Pour a little gravy inside through the hole and 
serve very hot. 

Beef Bump with Dumplings 

Cover four or five pounds of the rump of beef with cold 
water. Skim when it comes to a boil, salt the water to taste, 
and boil four or four and one-half hours until very tender. 
Remove from the pot and place in a colander over hot water, 
and cover to keep moist. Strain the beef broth through a 
soup strainer, take out some for gravy, and return the rest in 
which to boil dumplings. Thicken the gravy no thicker than 
cream. Pour some over the meat and serve the rest in a 
gravy boat. 

Dumplings 

One pint and a half of flour, one teaspoon of lard, a little 
salt, two heaping teaspoons of baking powder. Mix these, wet- 
ting with hot water. When partly mixed, add one beaten egg^ 
more water, and make the dough stiff enough to drop into the 
water. Cover, and boil ten minutes, having care not to turn 
them over in the pot. Serve at once. 

Devilled Roast Beef Bones 

Take the bones from cold roast beef, leaving as much meat 
as possible on them. Season with salt and pepper, and rub 
them with mustard paste. Roll in fresh bread crumbs and 
sprinkle each one with little pieces of butter. Broil over a slow 
fire until a nice brown and serve on a hot dish with thickened 
brown gravy around them, or over them, as you wish.

MEATS 147 



Beef a la Mode 



Cut and trim neatly the under part of a round of beef and 
soak it in vinegar and spices for three or four hours. Prepare 
the vinegar as follows : Chop one onion very fine, add a little 
salt, pepper, dry mustard, and a few whole cloves. Mix all 
with one cup of vinegar and boil for five minutes. Turn the 
meat frequently. Lard it with pieces of salt pork cut about 
one-quarter of an inch square and in strips as long as the meat 
is thick. Brown three onions, one carrot, and one turnip, all 
sliced, in drippings. Place them in a pan. Brown the meat in 
the same way, fasten a cloth round the beef, so as to keep it a 
good shape, then place it in the pan on a perforated tin a little 
higher than the bottom of the pan. Cover about half with boil- 
ing water, add a small bag of herbs ; partially cover the pot, and 
simmer for three and a half hours, or until tender, — it depends 
upon the size of the beef. Remove the cloth and place the meat 
on hot platter. Skim the grease from the gravy, season with 
salt and pepper, and thicken with flour blended with a little 
water. Let it boil and brown. Strain and pour over the beef. 
Garnish with potatoes cut in fancy shapes and small boiled 
onions. 

Fillet of Beef with Mushroom Sauce 

Buy the short fillet under the rump, using two if necessary. 
Wipe, remove the fat and veins and tendons in the middle, 
and have it well larded with thin strips of pork. All this 
can be done by the butcher. Then rub the fillet well with 
salt and pepper. Put two slices of fat pork in baking pan 
with one slice of onion and a bit of bay leaf. Place the 
meat in the pan and bake in a hot oven for thirty minutes. 
Baste often, and serve with mushroom sauce poured round the 
meat. 



148 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

Mushroom Sauce 

Pour off all but two tablespoonfuls of drippings in the pan. 
Stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour, and when brown add one 
pint of boiling water. Cook until it thickens. Then strain 
into a saucepan and add one cup of mushrooms, one tablespoon 
of lemon juice, and more salt if needed. Heat thoroughly but 
do not let it boil. 

Braised Roll of Beef a la Printaniere 

Select a piece of sirloin of beef well covered with fat and 
weighing about twelve or fifteen pounds. Remove the bone, 
leaving the fillet adhering to the upper part. Lard the fillet 
with pieces of ham or bacon, having the pieces one-quarter of 
an inch square and four inches long. Then roll the beef up 
close and fasten it round with a string to secure its shape. 
Break up the bones and place them with the trimmings in the 
bottom of a pan or kettle. Place the roll of beef on the bones. 
Add two carrots, two onions with a clove stuck in each, tAVO 
heads of celery, and a small bouquet. Moisten with about 
quarter of a bottle of Sherry, and, if desired, one small glass of 
brandy. Set the whole on the range and let it simmer slowly 
for ten minutes. Then add enough good beef broth or con- 
somme to nearly cover the beef. Cover the beef w4th a but- 
tered paper. When the liquid comes to a boil, place where 
it will boil slowly for two or three hours, or until tender. The 
time has to be regulated by the size and tenderness of the meat. 
Dish it, place round it groups of young carrots, turned in their 
own shape, asparagus tops, small buds of cauliflower, and 
French beans cut in diamond shapes and boiled green. Cut 
some boiled turnips in the shape of deep saucers. Fill each 
one with green peas and place in a border round the dish. 
Pour some Espagnole sauce round the border of turnips, glaze 
the meat, and serve very hot. 



MEATS 149 

Fried Ox Tails 

Cut between the joints in pieces about three inches long, 
the thick part of half a dozen ox tails. Soak in cold water for 
about one hour. Drain, and put in a saucepan with three- 
quarters of a pound of sliced onion and one pound and three- 
quarters of sliced carrot. Season with salt and pepper, add 
one good-sized bouquet, and cover all with three quarts of 
broth. Boil over a slow fire for three or four hours, or until 
the meat is tender. Test it with a fork. Put the pieces in a 
dish and cover them with the broth. When partially cool, dip 
each piece in beaten egg^ then in fine bread crumbs ; fry until a 
nice brown. Drain on brown paper. Serve hot with a tomato 

sauce. 

Corned Beef 

Select a six-pound piece of rump or brisket corned beef 
and place it in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover it. 
Let it boil briskly three hours and a half or more, until tender. 
If served with kale sprouts, add them to the meat about one- 
half hour before time for serving. Drain them on to a hot 
platter and place the corned beef on them. If wished, plain 
boiled spinach may be served instead of sprouts. 

French Creamed Corned Beef Hash 

Cut up in equal-sized pieces some nice, red cooked corned 
beef, also some cooked potatoes cut in the same way. Do not 
chop them. To one cup of meat have three-quarters of a cup 
of potatoes. Put a tablespoonful of butter in an iron or agate 
saucepan. When the butter begins to boil, add the beef and 
potatoes, and a little chopped green pepper. When well mixed 
in butter, add one cup of rich cream. Mix well, and let it boil 
up once. Serve on a very hot platter. Garnish with heart- 
shaped pieces of toast, put sprigs of parsley round the platter. 
Poached eggs may be served with it on a separate dish.

Timbale of Tongue with Sauce 

Place two pounds of smoked boiled tongue and the breast 
of one medium-sized raw chicken in a mortar, and pound until 
smooth. Then stir in two tablespoons of flour, the whites 
of two eggs, one cup of cream, one tablespoon of Breton red 
coloring, a little salt and pepper, and a dash of cayenne. Press 
through a puree sieve. Then stir in one cup of whipped cream. 
Decorate the bottom of a buttered mould with pieces of truffles. 
Fill with the tongue and chicken mixture. Cover with buttered 
paper. Place in a pan of water and in a moderate oven ; cook

until the sauce becomes of the right consistency. Season with 
salt, white pepper, and three tablespoonfuls of Madeira wine. 
Stir in some finely chopped truffles. Serve very hot. 

Tongue Stew 

Put a fresh tongue in cold water, add three pounds of lean 
beef. Let them boil together gently four hours, and at the 
end of the time add carrots, potatoes, and other vegetables if 
you wish. Brown the flour with which you thicken the gravy, 
and before thickening add a dozen cloves, salt and pepper to 
taste, and half a glass of wine. Strain the gravy to get out all 
the bones, peel the tongue, return it to the gravy, and send to 
the table without the beef. 

Brains with Mushrooms 

Prepare the brain of an ox by washing and skimming it, 
and then steep it on the back of the range for an hour. When 



MEATS 151 

it is well steeped, rub it with flour and salt, lay on it bits of 
butter, and set it in the oven, having added water to the dish in 
which it is to bake. Bake it for an hour, basting it often, and 
serve with a mushroom sauce. An onion sauce may be substi- 
tuted for the mushroom sauce. 

Stewed Beef Kidney- 
Select two beef kidneys, remove the fatty substance from 
the middle, and cut in slices. Wash in salt and water, then in 
fresh water. Drain thoroughly and season with salt and pepper. 
Fry in boiling hot butter until slightly brown, shaking the sauce- 
pan all the time. Drain the butter off and put the kidneys on 
a plate. Pour a scant pint of Espagnole sauce in a saucepan 
with two wine-glasses of Sherry. Boil until quite thick. Add 
some sliced mushrooms, — seven or eight, — the kidneys, four 
ounces of butter in small bits, some chopped parsley, and lemon 
juice. Mix well without boiling. Taste, and add more season- 
ing if necessary. Dish up as high as possible on an entree dish. 

Baked Tripe 

Cut one pound and a half of tripe in small squares. Put 
them in an agate pan with five chopped onions. Season with 
salt and white pepper. Cover with stock or water and bake in 
a slow oven for three hours. Pour off the liquid, strain it into 
a saucepan. Add enough flour to make a thick sauce. Stir 
over hot fire until it boils up once. Range the tripe, etc., in 
a baking dish. Pour in the sauce and cover all with mashed 
potatoes beaten to a cream. Bake in a hot oven until all is 
thoroughly heated and the potatoes a nice brown. 

Fried Tripe with Espagnole Sauce 

Cut two pounds of tripe into small pieces. Fry until a 
light brown, with three ounces of butter, one finely chopped 



152 3fRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

onion, and half a green pepper finely chopped. Peel one good- 
sized tomato, cut it in pieces, and mix with one-half pint of 
Espagnole sauce. Season with salt, pepper, a bouquet, and 
one crushed clove of garlic. Stir the tripe in this sauce and 
cook for ten minutes. Remove the bouquet, add one teaspoon- 
ful of finely chopped parsley, and serve at once. 

Stewed Tripe with Tomatoes 

Wash one pound of tripe, cover it with hot water, add one 
onion cut in quarters, and stew thirty-five minutes. Stew one 
pint of tomatoes ten minutes, strain, add a seasoning of salt 
and pepper, and two tablespoons of flour wet with cold water. 
Drain the tripe thoroughly, cut it in strips, and add it to the 
sauce. Boil all up together with a tablespoon of butter and 
serve. 

Fricasseed Veal 

Divide into bits of say the size of your two fingers a couple 
of pounds of veal, and make it quite free of fat, bone, and skin. 
Dissolve a couple of ounces of butter in a stewpan, and just as 
it begins to boil lay in the veal and shake the pan until the 
meat is firm, but uncolored. Stir in a tablespoon of flour, and 
when it is well mixed with the cutlets pour gradually over 
them, shaking the pan often, enough hot veal stock or gravy to 
cover them. Stew them gently until they are perfectl}^ tender 
— this may be fifty or sixty minutes, or longer. Add salt, a 
quarter of a pint of rich cream, and, if you like, a few strips of 
lemon rind. Two or three dozen mushroom buttons added 
twenty minutes before it is served will improve the fricassee. 

Veal Potpie with Dumplings 

Cut three pounds of the leg or loin of veal in small pieces 
about three inches square. Cut one-half pound of salt pork in 
thin slices. Lay the pieces of pork in the bottom of pot, then 



MEATS 153 

add pieces of veal, then more pork and veal. Cover with tepid 
water and let it slowly come to a boil. Chop one onion and 
one head of celery very fine and add to the veal. Let all simmer 
for one hour, then season to taste. Be sure you have enough 
liquid in which to cook the dumplings. Twenty minutes before 
serving, put in your dumplings, dropping them a spoonful at a 
time. Let them boil steadily for fifteen minutes. Remove at 
once and dish. Put the meat in the centre of a deep platter 
and the dumplings round. Strain the broth in which meat and 
dumplings were cooked, and skim off all the fat. In a saucepan 
melt one tablespoonful butter, add one teaspoonful flour, and 
then the broth. Pour over the meat and serve very hot. 
Garnish with parsley. 

Dumpling for Potpie 

One egg, one cup of flour, half a cup of water, one teaspoon 
of baking powder, half a teaspoon of salt, a pinch of cayenne. 
Sift the flour and baking powder together and add the cayenne. 
Whip the egg very lightly and add it to the water. Then mix 
with the flour. Beat well with wire whisk. Boil in the pot 
with the meat. Do not put them too close together, but allow 
room for them to swell. 

Veal a la Cadet 

Choose a solid piece of fat white veal. With a larding 
needle thrust inside some long strips of larding pork and ham. 
Put the veal in a hollow earthen vessel with some thinly sliced 
onion, olive oil, pieces of thyme, bay leaves, parsley, salt, and 
white pepper. Let it soak for six or seven hours, occasionally 
turning it so it will absorb the seasoning. Then place on a 
long skewer, wrap in three thicknesses of oiled paper with the 
vegetables, etc., inside, and roast in a moderate oven for one 
hour and a half, according to size. Remove the paper, leave 
the vegetables in the pan, let the veal brown, and put it on a 



154 

dish. Add a little broth and a dash of cayenne to the liquid in 
the pan. Cook for a minute or two. Then strain and remove 
grease. Mix with one pint of tomato sauce. Heat thoroughly. 
Dish veal, pour some of the sauce round it, and serve the rest 
in a separate dish. 

Veal Cutlets a la Polonaise 

The following proportions are for six : Take two pounds 
of veal from a leg of veal, chop the meat fine, add two table- 
spoons of bread crumbs or of rolled cracker crumbs, one table- 
spoon of butter, four eggs, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix 
the ingredients well, form them in fiat oval cutlets about half 
an inch thick, paint with the white of an egg^ sprinkle with 
cracker meal, and fry in butter to a golden brown. Serve a 
slice of lemon on each cutlet. A lemon sauce is sometimes 
served with the cutlets, but more often green peas or macaroni 
with drawn butter, or a puree of potatoes. These cutlets are 
also delicious when made from the breast of a turkey or chicken. 

Veal Cutlet with Puree of Cucumber 

Flatten, trim, and season with salt or pepper eight small veal 
cutlets. Fry in melted butter until a light brown on both sides. 
Drain off the butter, add one glass of sherry, a little broth, 
and two ladles of Espagnole sauce. Cover and stew fifteen 
minutes. Pour some of the puree on a dish, arrange the cutlets 
in a circle. Pour the reduced sauce over them and serve. 

Veal Cutlets London Fashion 

Take cutlets a little more than a quarter of an inch thick, 
cut from the best end of a neck of veal, free them from skin 
and fat, brush them with egg, dip them in fine bread crumbs, 
and fry them a light brown in deep fat. Toast or broil apart 
as many slices of bacon as you have cutlets, and set the bacon 
and cutlets on their edge round the inside of a hot dish, placing 



MEATS 155 

them alternately. Pour in the middle a rich gravy, or vsub- 
stitute for this a rich mushroom sauce. Savory herbs and 
salt and pepper should be mixed with the bread crumbs. 

Veal Loaf 

Cut the last shavings from the almost naked bone of a boiled 

ham. If you have no cold veal, cook one pound of it. The 

coarsest piece will do, but it must be lean. While the meat 

cools, boil down the liquor it was boiled in until there is only 

one-half cupful. If your veal is already cooked, treat a cupful 

of gravy the same way. Add to this a teaspoonful of butter, 

the juice of half a lemon, pepper and salt to taste, and a pinch 

of mace. Chop the veal and ham very fine, mix well together. 

Moisten thoroughly with the gravy and press into a bowl or 

mould. Cover the surface with a small plate, and on this set a 

heavy weight. By the following day it will be firm. Invert 

it on a dish and cut in thin slices. Scraps of poultry may be 

worked up nicely with the ham. Keeping an eye to the odds 

and ends enables one to make many a tasty relish without extra 

expense. 

Veal a la Marengo 

Cut three and a half pounds of lean veal in small pieces. 

Put them in a saucepan with two and a half ounces of pork 

and one onion, both cut in small pieces. Shake them round in 

the pan and, when a nice brown, sprinkle with three scant 

tablespoons of flour. Stir all together. Then add one quart 

of broth and one gill of tomato sauce. Season with salt, pepper, 

a bouquet, and a little garlic. Cook all for forty-five minutes. 

Serve on a hot platter and garnish with squares of bread fried 

a golden brown color. Sprinkle finely chopped parsley over 

the meat. 

Flaw 

Boil a piece of lean veal till it is tender. Take it up, cut it 
in strips three or four inches long, put it back in the pot with 



156 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

the liquor it was boiled in, and add a teacup of rice to three 
pounds of veal. For the same quantity of veal allow a piece of 
butter the size of an Qgg. Season with salt, pepper, and sweet 
herbs if you like. Stew gently till the rice is tender and the 
water nearly stewed away. 

Knuckle of Veal with Rice 

Pour over a small knuckle of veal rather more than water 
enough to cover it, bring it slowly to a boil, take off the scum 
with great care, and throw in a teaspoon of salt. When the 
joint has simmered for about half an hour, throw in from eight 
to twelve ounces of well-washed rice, and stew the meat gently 
for an hour and a half longer, or until both meat and rice are 
perfectly tender. A seasoning of cayenne and more salt, 
should it be required, are added twenty or thirty minutes before 
serving. If it is at hand, good veal broth may with advantage 
be substituted for the water. 

Pickled Veal 

Cut cold cooked veal in small pieces and cover with scalding 
hot vinegar. To three scant pints of vinegar add ten whole 
cloves, half a stick of cinnamon, one teaspoonful of salt, and ten 
peppercorns. Stir these into the scalding vinegar and then 
pour over the veal. Let the mixture stand for one day. It is 
then ready to serve for luncheon or supper. 

Meat and Nut Balls 

Blanch the nuts and allow thirty to every pint of chopped 
meat. The nuts should also be chopped. Either veal or lamb 
may be used. Mix the nuts and meat, season with pepper and 
salt, and use an Qgg or two for binding the whole together. 
Mould in small balls, or roll them out in croquette form and 
lay them in a baking dish. Pour over them a pint of strained 



MEATS 157 

tomatoes, allowing a pint to a pint of the mixture of nuts and 
meat, and cook fifteen or twenty minutes. Serve the balls on 
a hot dish, and pour round them the thickened tomatoes. 

Sweetbread Jardiniere with Sauce 

Prepare three pairs of sweetbreads by first letting them 
stand in cold water for one hour. Change the water during 
that time. Then put them over the fire with enough white 
stock to cover them. Add one teaspoonful of salt, six whole 
peppers, one blade of mace, one onion, one slice of carrot, and a 
stalk of celery. Let them come to the boiling-point, remove, 
and leave them in the liquor until cold enough to handle. 
Then remove all the skin and fatty parts and cut them in the 
shape of a chop. Press them by putting a plate on top and 
setting a light weight on it, to keep them in shape. Leave 
them in the press one hour. Put two ounces of butter in a 
saucepan and clarify it. Then add the sweetbreads. When 
they become a rich golden brown, remove them and keep them 
in a warm place. Have some nice chicken forcemeat. Put a 
layer of it on top of each sweetbread, and on top of that, a slice 
of cooked beef tongue a little smaller than the sweetbread. 
Wrap each one in oiled paper. Place in a pan and steam on 
top of the range until the forcemeat is firm. Have some spinach 
cooked and put through a fine sieve. Place on a dish a mould 
of spinach. With spinach in a pastry bag ornament the edges 
of the dish, and in the centre make a rosette so the sweetbreads 
will have a support. Have some nice white turnips cooked in 
stock. Cut them in halves, or with a fancy cutter cut each one 
the desired size. Then with a small cutter scoop out the inside 
of the turnip. Let them stand in the broth they were cooked 
in until wanted. Now dish your sweetbreads, remove the 
paper. Place them round on the spinach border. Put turnips 
round the dish, fill each one with green peas. Serve with the 
following sauce : — 



158 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Jardiniere Sauce 

Melt one tablespoonf ul of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, 
and when they come to a boil add a teaspoonf ul of finely chopped 
onion, one of celery chopped very fine, two cloves, one table- 
spoonful of carrot chopped fine, one teaspoonful of salt, one 
small bunch of parsley, and a dash of cayenne. When this has 
boiled a few minutes, add one pint of good consomme. Cook 
until it thickens. When ready to serve add two tablespoonf uls 
Madeira wine. Serve very hot. 

Baked Sweetbreads 

Trim eight heart sweetbreads, soak in cold water for two 
hours, parboil, press and cool between two pieces of tin. Pre- 
pare a matignon of the following ingredients : Fry a few finely 
sliced carrots and shallots, a little parsley and herbs in four 
ounces of butter until slightly browned. Moisten with a glass 
of white wine and simmer slowly for five minutes. Pour this 
over the sweetbreads and let them soak for two hours, turning 
them frequently. Drain the sweetbreads, wrap them in thin 
slices of fat pork, fold in buttered paper, put on skewers, and 
roast before a moderate fire. Remove paper and pork, glaze 
nicely, and serve with a demiglaze sauce made with the ma- 
tignon, a little broth, and Espagnole sauce. 

Sweetbreads with Brown Sauce 

Clean and soak two pairs of sweetbreads in cold water for an 
hour or more, then put them in a pan with enough boiling water 
to cover them, and cook them for twenty minutes. Take them 
out and place them in cold water for two or three minutes to 
make them firm. Dry thoroughly, rub them with a tablespoon- 
ful of butter. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and place in a pan 
with brown sauce. Cook in hot oven for twenty minutes. 
Baste often with the sauce.

Sweetbread Croquettes with Sauce 

Trim and soak six good-sized sweetbreads in cold water for 
three hours. Then parboil, drain, and cool. Cut in thick 
slices and fry until quite dry, with two ounces of melted butter, 
salt, white pepper, and a little grated nutmeg. Then place 
them on a paper to drain. Put two tablespoons of finely chopped 
shallots with the butter, fry a little, add one pint of cooked 
mushrooms cut in very small pieces, fry a minute or two, add 
one pint Allemande sauce, and the yolks of four eggs. Stir very 
hard and boil one minute. Then add the sweetbreads cut in 
very small pieces, some finely chopped, and a little lemon juice. 
Mix well and turn into a dish to cool. When cold, shape them 
in oblong pieces, dip in beaten Qgg^ then in fine bread crumbs, 
then in Qgg and bread crumbs again. Fry in hot fat until a 
light brown. Drain on brown paper and serve with the follow- 
ing sauce in a separate sauce dish : — 

One pint of veloute sauce, quite thick, one glass of white 
wine, two tablespoons of beef extract. Boil five minutes. Add 
two tablespoons of fine-chopped mushrooms and some chopped 
parsley. Mix with the sauce without boiling. 

Sweetbread Patties 
Soak sweetbreads in cold water, remove the pipes and 
membranes. Cook eighteen minutes in boiling salted water 
with one tablespoonful of lemon juice. Then plunge in cold 
water to harden. When cold, cut them in small pieces, heat 
with a rich cream sauce, and serve in pastry shells or in biscuit 
boxes. 

Scalloped Sweetbreads 

Soak four sweetbreads in cold water for two hours. Par- 
boil them. When cold, trim and cut in slices. Stew them for 
six minutes with one ounce of butter, one-half wine-glassful of 



160 MRS. seely's cook book 

white wine, one scant tablespoonful of salt, and one teaspoonful 
of white pepper, and a little grated nutmeg if desired. Then

in a brisk oven. When slightly brown, remove and serve. 

Sweetbread Timbale 

Place one pair of large cooked sweetbreads and three 
pounds of raw white meat of chicken in a mortar with the 
whites of two eggs. Pound to a fine pulp. Then press 
through a puree sieve. Moisten with one-half cup of Bechamel 
sauce and one-half cup of cream. Beat all together until very 
light. Season to taste with salt, white pepper, a dash of 
cayenne, and a little grated nutmeg. Mix thoroughly. Set 
away on ice until it is thoroughly chilled. Then take a small 
portion, place in a buttered timbale dish, and poach for about 
ten minutes. At the end of that time if not firm to the touch, 
mix the beaten white of one egg to the raw mixture. If too 
firm to the touch, add more cream to the raw mixture. Then 
place in buttered moulds, cover with buttered paper, and poach 
in oven until firm to the touch. Serve with Princess sauce or 
any other to suit the taste. 

Veal Kidney Pie 

Select three nice veal kidneys, wash, and soak them in salted 
water, then in fresh water. Chop very fine, also chop the fat 
and mix with the following : The chopped yolks of four hard- 
boiled eggs, a few finely chopped herbs and pieces of celery, a 
dash of grated nutmeg, ground mace, cloves, and wliite pepper, 
and salt to taste. Line a deep-buttered dish with puff pastry.

and press them together. Cut a small opening in the top of 
the pie and bake. Serve while hot. 

Stewed Calf's Liver 
Have a piece of liver weighing one and one-half or two 
pounds cut into small pieces. Cook for five minutes with one 
finely chopped onion, one bruised clove of garlic, and one ounce 
of butter. Season with pinch of salt and one-half pinch of 
pepper. Shake the pan all the time. Then add one wine-glass 
of white wine, and one gill of Espagnole sauce, and seven or 
eight chopped mushrooms. Cook all for three minutes. Stir

Baked Calf's Liver with Glazed Onions 
Take a calf's liver weighing about three pounds, and on the 
under side make a long deep slit from the thick end to the 
thinnest end. Be careful to cut it straight. Stuff into this 
pouch the following mixture : Two tablespoons of chopped 
parsley, one pound of cooked ham, leaving the fat on, one 
medium-sized onion, one cup of bread crumbs moistened with a 
little stock. Chop all these together and add two raw eggs, 
one saltspoonful of black pepper, and mix thoroughly. Sew up 
the pouch closely. Sprinkle the liver with one-half teaspoonful 
of salt and one-half teaspoonful of pepper. Then put a few 
very thin slices of fat pork over the top and put in a pan with 
about one pint broth, adding to it one teaspoonful of flour 
mixed thoroughly with one tablespoonful of butter. Cook 
about one hour in a moderate oven. Baste four or five times. 
Serve on a platter with a garnish of glazed onions round the 
edge. Strain the gravy through a very fine sieve or cloth and 
pour over the liver. 

Glazed Onions 

Peel and cook for ten minutes in plenty of boiling salted 
water one pint of small white onions. Drain and dry thor-

oughly. Put in a baking pan two tablespoonfuls of butter and 
half a pint of broth, and place the onions so they do not touch 
each other. Cover them with two tablespoons of granulated 
sugar. Bake in oven for fifteen minutes. Be sure to turn 
them often, so they will become evenly colored. 

Fried Calf's Liver and Bacon 

Cut the necessary amount of calf's liver in thin slices and 
wash it in cold water. Place some thin slices of bacon in a hot 
pan and cook them until they are crisp. Remove from the pan 
and keep them hot. Place the pan where there is not an 
intense heat, drop the slices of liver into the bacon fat, and cook 
slowly — for five or six minutes or until cooked. Serve on 
a hot platter and garnish with the bacon. Liver should be 
cooked slowly to make it moist and wholesome. 

Fried Calf's Brains 

Remove the arteries and soak four calves' brains in cold 
water for two hours. Put in a saucepan with water which 
tastes strongly of vinegar, a few pep23ercorns, salt, a bunch of 
parsley with herbs tied in it, and a sliced onion. Boil slowly 
for forty minutes. Drain on a cloth. Divide each lobe in two 
or more pieces. Sprinkle the pieces with dry crumbs, dip in 
beaten eggs, roll in fresh white crumbs, and arrange in a frying 
basket. Immerse in plenty of very Jiot fat and fry a nice color. 
Drain on paper and serve. Garnish with fried parsley and 
pass Tartare sauce. 

Calf s Brains with Mushroom Sauce 

Soak two calves' brains in cold water for half an hour, 
remove the skins, wash again, drain thoroughly, then place in a 
saucepan with just enough water to cover them. Add one 
teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter of a cup of vinegar, and nine 



MEATS 163 

whole peppers. Cook about ten or fifteen minutes. Drain 
and place on a hot dish. 

Have the following sauce prepared: Brown eighteen or 
twenty small onions in one ounce and a half of butter. When 
a good color add a little flour, enough to absorb the butter. 
Stir for a few minutes, then stir in one-half cupful of stock and 
one cup of claret. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. 
Set the pan where the sauce will cook slowly for half an hour. 
Empty one can of mushrooms, wash them, and cut in moderately 
small pieces. Mix these with the sauce and boil for ten min- 
utes. Garnish the brains with the vegetables and pour the 
sauce over all. 

Calf's Brains a la Vinaigrette 

Wash three good-sized calves' brains, remove the skins, and 
then wash again. Drain thoroughly. Put them in a sauce- 
pan and cover with fresh water, three small pinches of salt, half 
a cup of vinegar, one carrot sliced, a dozen whole peppers, sprig 
of thyme, and one bay leaf. Cook for ten minutes. Drain 
thoroughly. Cut each brain in half. Serve hot on a folded 
napkin on a dish with vinaigrette sauce in a sauce-boat. Gar- 
nish with parsley. 

Calf's Head 

The butcher should first prepare the head for use. Wash 
it thoroughly and remove the brains, which may be kept for 
frying, as mock oysters, or may be added later. Cover with 
cold water, take off the scum as the head begins to heat, and 
boil it gently from one to two hours. Remove from the fire, 
let it cool, and bone it entirely. Lay the boned head in a stew- 
pan, replace the brains if you wish to stew them, and simmer 
gently for an hour in its own gravy. Half an hour before it 
is served, add a pint of mushroom buttons. If it is necessary, 
thicken the gravy with a little flour or corn-starch and lay 



164 MES. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

forcemeat balls round the disli in which the head is served. 
Salt to taste and cayenne pepper should be added during the 
stewing. If you have not the mushrooms at hand, a bunch of 
sage leaves finely minced may be added instead. 

Calf's Heart Roasted 

Make a forcemeat of fine bread crumbs, a quarter of a pound 
of beef suet chopped small, a little parsley, sweet marjoram, 
pepper, salt, and if your taste finds them agreeable, lemon peel 
and nutmeg. Mix these ingredients with the yolk of an egg 
and place them in the heart. Tie the heart and roast, turning 
it frequently. Serve with slices of lemon and melted butter 
poured over it. 

Fried Chops with Brown Sauce 

Take eight good-sized lamb chops, — Frenched, — scrape the 
meat from four of them, and spread on each side of the other 
four. Roll in beaten egg and cracker crumbs and fry in deep 
hot fat. In the centre of a platter of all kinds of vegetables 
cut in small pieces, make a mould. Arrange the chops round 
the mould and cover with a brown sauce. 

Brown Sauce 

One teasjDOonful of melted butter, one teaspoonful of flour, 
stir over fire until a light brown. Add a little horseradish, 
salt and pepper, and half a cup of stock. 

Haricot of Lamb 

Select a fat fore quarter of lamb, cut off the chops, and cut 
the remainder in square pieces. Place the pieces in a saucepan 
with five ounces of butter, cook until colored a nice brown; 
drain off the fat, sprinkle in a little flour, mix well, and cook a 
minute longer. Add one quart and a pint of water and one 
pint of tomato sauce, season with salt, white pepper, and a 



MEATS 165 

grated nutmeg if so desired. Let all come to a boil. Skim 
the meat from the broth and place in another saucepan. Rub 
the sauce through a fine sieve over the meat. Add a bouquet, 
a few carrots and turnips cut in small pieces, and eigliteen small 
onions sugared and browned in butter. Boil half an hour, then 
add one pint of raw potato balls. Boil slowly lialf an hour 
longer. Place the saucepan at the side of the range and let it 
stand for fifteen minutes. Skim off all the fat and remove the 
bouquet. Dish in conical form and serve. 

Hind Quarter of Spring Lamb 

Select a medium-sized hind quarter of lamb. Trim the bone 
and place the flank over the ribs to prevent them from being 
cooked too much. Fasten all together securely. Season with 
one tablespoon of salt, rubbing it over the meat. Cover it vrith 
the thin fat and place it in a dripping pan with one tablespoon- 
ful of water. Place in a moderate oven and roast for one hour, 
basting it with its own drippings. Remove the fat, cover the 
bone with paper ruffle, and serve on a hot dish. Skim the 
grease from the drippings and strain it over the lamb. Serve 
mint sauce with it if wished. 

Curry of Lamb with Asparagus Tops 

Cut three and a half pounds of shoulder of lamb in two-inch 
squares. Wash thoroughly and drain. Place in a saucepan 
with enough water to cover. Let them come to a boil. Drain 
and wash again. Then cover them with boiling water, one and 
a half tablespoonfuls of salt, three-quarters of a teaspoonful of 
pepper, five small onions, and a bouquet. Let all cook and 
steam for forty-five minutes. Strain the liquid into another 
saucepan with one-half pint of white sauce. Stir until it boils 
and then stand where it will keep warm. Beat the yolks of 
four eggs and the juice of half a lemon together. Gradually 
stir this into the sauce. Pour over the lamb. Also add one 



166 MBS. seely's cook book 

pint of asparagus tops. Do not let it boil. Serve steaming 
hot with a garnish of boiled rice. 

Fillets of Mutton 
Prepare four fillets of mutton, removing all the sinews and 
almost all the fat. Cut them in two pieces. Flatten them 
and season with salt and white pepper. Melt four ounces of 
butter in a saucepan, add the fillets, and fry them until they are 
thoroughly cooked and a light brown. Turn them frequently. 
Remove and drain on a plate. In the saucepan add one table- 
spoonful of flour, one pint of broth, and a glass of Sherry. 
Boil for a minute or two. Arrange the mutton alternately 
with fried bread, cut the same size. Skim the grease from the 
sauce, strain it, and garnish the fillets. 

Roast Mutton 
Select a medium-sized leg of mutton, cut off the bone and 
trim it. Rub it with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with little 
pieces of butter and roast in a moderate oven for one hour and 
a quarter. Baste often and turn it three or four times while it 
is roasting. Serve with either the strained gravy from the pan 
or thickened gravy. 

Roast Mutton 

Select a nice breast of mutton weighing about eight pounds. 
Sew it up in a piece of muslin or any thin cloth. Place it in a 
kettle with enough water to cover it. Let it stew or boil very 
slowly for one hour and twenty-five minutes. Remove the 
cloth and place the meat in a dripping pan. Rub it well with 
melted butter or drippings. Sprinkle with a little flour and roast 
in oven for about half or three-quarters of an hour. Baste it often 
with contents of the pan. Just before serving, sprinkle with 
fine crumbs and dots of butter. Let it get a nice brown. Gar- 
nish the dish with parsley. Make a sauce of the strained drip- 
pings from the meat.

Chops a la Signora with Sauce 
Cook one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful of 
flour for two minutes. Add one cupful of white broth and 
cook to a thick, smooth sauce. Then add one cupful of finely 
cut cooked chicken, half a cup of finely cut canned mushrooms, 
and, if handy, a little finely cut tongue and a little cream. 
Season to taste with salt, white pepper, and, if desired, a little 
grated nutmeg. Stir over the fire for five minutes. Spread 
on a dish and set aside until cold. Select six nice Frenched 
chops. Split them in half Avithout separating them and season 
with salt and pepper. Spread a thin layer of chicken between 
the two layers of each chop. Close each one, giving each chop 
its original form. Dip in beaten egg^ then cover with bread 
crumbs, and fry in clarified butter until a golden color and well 
done. Dress them in a circle on a hot dish, arrange a curled 
paper on each one, and serve with the following sauce : — 

Sauce for Chops 
Cook two tablespoonfuls each of finely chopped tongue and 
mushrooms with two tablespoonfuls of Madeira wine until dry. 
Then add one cupful of Espagnole sauce and one-half cup of 
stewed, strained tomatoes. Cook five minutes and serve in sepa- 
rate dish or in the centre of the chop dish. If desired, the chops 
may rest on pieces of fried bread the same size as the chops. 

Roast Saddle of Mutton 
Trim a small saddle of Southdown mutton. Pull oiT the 
thin skin and make a small cut in the fat. Remove nearly all 
the suet inside, also the kidneys. Tie firmly in a neat shape 
and roast in quite a hot oven for one hour and a half. Drain, 
and let it stand in a warm place for ten or fifteen minutes. 
Skim all the grease from the drippings, add a little flour and 
stock, make a brown gravy, and serve in separate dish. Also 
serve currant jelly.

Boiled Leg of Mutton 

Trim a medium-sized leg of mutton, put in a kettle with one 
bouquet and enough salted cold water to cover it. Boil for 
one hour and a half, or until tender. Serve with caper sauce 
made of plain cream sauce with capers, or Hollandaise sauce 
with a handful of capers added. The sauce must be served 
hot. 

Mutton Stew 

Remove the skin from three pounds of mutton cut from the 
shoulder. Cut the fat from it, place in a saucepan, and cook it 
until there is about five tablespoonfuls of liquid. Remove the 
fat and add one scant quart of sliced onion. Cover and place 
where it will cook slowly for one hour. Occasionally stir it. 
Then stir in one tablespoonful of flour and the mutton cut 
in small pieces. Cook until it is slightly browned, and then 
add one quart of boiling water, three teaspoonfuls of salt, 
one teaspoonful of pepper. Let it simmer for one hour and 
three-quarters, then add one quart of sliced raw potato 
and one tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley. Simmer 
for half an hour longer, or until the meat and potatoes are 
tender. Add more salt and pepper, if necessary, and serve very 
hot. 

Devilled Mutton 

Slice some undercooked mutton about one inch thick, score 
it, and spread with the following mixture : One teaspoonful 
of dry mustard, two teaspoonfuls of olive oil, one teaspoonful 
of vinegar, and half a teaspoonful of white pepper, and a dash of 
cayenne pepper. Mix thoroughly before spreading on the 
meat. Place the slices on a greased broiler and cook over a 
clear fire for six or seven minutes. Frequently turn the 
broiler and avoid scorching the meat. Serve with maitre 
d'hotel sauce.

Boiled Leg of Mutton 

Take a well-kept but perfectly sweet leg of mutton of mid- 
dling weight, and after having washed (not soaked) it, lay it in 
a kettle of its size, as nearly as possible, and pour in rather more 
than sufficient cold water to cover it. Set the kettle over a 
good fire, and when the water begins to boil take off the scum, 
and continue to till no more appears. After the first skimming 
throw in a tablespoonful of salt, and after the water is well 
cleared, add two medium-sized onions stuck with a dozen 
cloves and a bundle or bouquet of parsley, thyme, and savory, 
four or five large carrots, and a half an hour afterward as 
many turnips. Draw the kettle to a spot on the range where 
the mutton wall simmer gently for two hours and a half from 
the time it first begins to boil. If stewed gently, the mutton 
will be found excellent. If hurried, it will be like the unpala- 
table, hard, and ragged fast-boiled meat sent up by ignorant 
and tasteless cooks and served by inexperienced housekeepers. 
Boiled mutton should be served with caper sauce or brown 
cucumber sauce or oyster sauce. From the liquor in which the 
mutton is boiled excellent soup may be made. 

Plain Boiled Mutton 

Cover with cold water and skim when the pot has come to a 
boil. Salt the water to taste. Boil gently until very tender. 
Add three or four whole onions. 

Mutton Pilau 

Boil rice till the kernels are quite done and yet unbroken. 
Cut cold boiled mutton in pieces an inch square, fry in butter, 
and season with salt, pepper, a few cardamons, a little onion, 
and chopped mint. After the mixture has simmered half an 
hour, add a little of the boiled rice and continue the cooking 
fifteen or twenty minutes. The gravy formed by the butter, 



170 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

seasoning, and rice should slightly flavor the browned mutton. 
Serve by laying some of the boiled rice on a dish and laying on 
it mutton and gravy, then putting on another layer of rice and 
upon this pouring mutton and gravy. 

Mutton Cromeskies 

Prepare the cold mutton by mincing it and seasoning it with 
salt, pepper, and thyme and parsley, or chopped onion, if you 
wish. Lay a little of the mince upon some slices of bacon cut 
very thin. Roll the bacon tightly and neatly round the mutton 
so that none may escape and tie the pieces round with fine 
twine. Dip each of the cromeskies in a frying batter and then 
drop them in deep, hot fat and fry to a delicate brown. Lay 
them round the edges of a dish piled in mountain form with 
plain boiled rice or mashed potato and garnished with tiny trees 
of parsley stuck in the sides. 

Cold Roast Leg of Mutton 

When a few slices have been cut from the joint, it will still 
afford a fillet of tolerable size, which may be dressed into a more 
savory dish than hash or mince. To do this, take off as much 
of the large end of the leg as will make that side of the fillet 
perfectly flat, cut also evenly through the joint where it has 
been carved. Now bone the fillet and place in the cavity veal 
forcemeat. Put the meat with the bones and trimmings into a 
kettle and cover them with water, or with broth if you have 
any stock at hand. As soon as it begins to boil, add a couple 
of onions, a bunch of parsley, two or three bay leaves, four or 
five carrots and turnips — plenty of vegetables, in fact. Let 
the whole simmer gently for a couple of hours. Serve the 
meat with the vegetables round it, and, if you wish, thicken the 
gravy. Some pungent or spicy sauce, which your taste tells 
you is in harmony with the dish, may also be added. 



MEATS 171 

Loin of Mutton dressed like Venison 

Skin and bone a loin of mutton and lay it in a braising pan 
with a pint of water, a large onion stuck with a dozen cloves, 
half a pint of Port wine, and a spoonful of vinegar. Add, also, 
when it boils, a small bouquet of thyme and parsley ; also pepper 
and salt. Let the whole stew three hours, turning the loin 
often. Stew the bones in another dish and add their gravy to 
the mutton as it requires liquor. Serve moist with the gravy 
in which it stews. 

Boned Leg of Mutton 

Have the butcher remove the bone of a nice fat leg of mutton 
that has been well hung. Make a forcemeat of bread crumbs, 
hard-boiled eggs, and onions chopped fine, and season with 
butter, a little sage, black pepper, and some salt pork cut up in 
small bits. Fill the leg with this forcemeat and bake several 
hours, basting often. The bone cut from the leg may be broken 
and with the trimmings of the meat boiled in the broth pot 
with rice for a most nourishing and palatable broth. 

Irish Stew 

Cut in pieces between the joints like chops two pounds of 
the scrao: of mutton. Slice three medium-sized onions in an iron 
saucepan, set over the fire well covered, and let the onions fry in 
their own juice, stirring and watching them that they may not 
burn. When they are done, lay in the meat and add one and 
a half quarts of water. Let the mixture come to a boil, and 
now upon further action the success or failure of your stew 
depends. Watch every minute or so till you find the spot on 
the range where the mixture will just simmer, no more — sim- 
mering is a slight motion, or sizzling, at one side of the sauce- 
pan. Add a teaspoon of salt, a half saltspoon of pepper, and 
let the meat cook two hours well covered. At the end of that 
time have ready as many potatoes as you need. Skim all the 



172 MRS. seely's cook book 

fat from the gravy. Cut up two potatoes in thin slices. These 

are to break and thicken the gravy. Then lay the others over 

the meat, cutting them in two if they are large. Do not mind 

if the gravy is not enough to cover the potatoes. It would be 

only broth if it were to do that. They are to cook by steam. 

Irish stew must always be closely covered while cooking. If 

the meat is stewed carefully and slowly, it will be so tender that 

you can tear it with a fork, and yet not tasteless and " done to 

rags." 

Real Scotch Hotch Fetch 

Cut up two pounds of scrag of mutton — the scrag is best 
because it is lean and carries the sweetness of the bone with its 
cooking, but any other lean part may be used. Put it on the fire to 
stew in one and a half pints of water and cook gently as directed 
for Irish stew for an hour and a half. Then cut up small a carrot, 
onion, and turnip, and add them to the meat with a teaspoon of 
salt and a scant one-half ounce of pepper. Add also half a can of 
fine marrowfat peas, mixing with the liquor of the peas a dessert- 
spoon of flour to thicken. Half an hour before serving add the 
other half of the peas. Be sure to skim off carefully all the fat 
after the meat is taken up, and if the gravy seems too plentiful, 
boil it down rapidly for a few minutes. In serving, lay the 
mutton in the centre of a dish and let the peas and other 
vegetables encircle it. 

Mutton Croquettes 

Have at hand one good pint of finely chopped mutton. 
Season with one tablespoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of 
white pepper, and one tablespoonful of lemon juice. Scald one 
cup of milk, mix one tablespoonful of flour and three tablespoon- 
fuls of butter together and stir in the milk. Then add the 
mutton. Boil for four minutes. Stir in two well-beaten eggs. 
Turn out on a platter. When cool, shape into the desired size, 
roll in fine bread crumbs, then in beaten egg, and again in bread 



MEATS 173 

crumbs. Fry in hot fat until a nice brown. The fat for frying 
should be the boiling degree of heat. If not, the croquettes will 
break open and absorb the grease. 

Broiled Lamb's Kidneys 

Skin, trim, and split lengthwise one dozen kidneys. Put 
them in a dish and season with salt, pepper, and sweet oil. 
Then put them on skewers — if not silver, have them bright 
and fresh-looking. Run the skewer through the centre of the 
two kidneys; do not separate them. Roll in fine bread crumbs 
and broil over a moderate fire for five minutes. Serve on a 
folded napkin with a thick brown sauce seasoned with Madeira 
in a separate dish. 

Devilled Lamb's Kidneys 

Prepare the kidneys the same as for broiling, and broil them 
for a minute or two on each side. Remove from the fire. Roll 
them well in English mustard paste which is seasoned with salt, 
a little white pepper, and a dash of cayenne. Then roll again 
in fine bread crumbs. Return them to the fire and broil four 
of five minutes longer. Serve with maitre d'hotel sauce poured 
over them. 

Baked Pork and Beans 

Soak one quart of white beans in cold water for twelve 
hours. Then put them in a pan with four quarts of cold water. 
Let them come to a boil and add salt, white pepper to taste, a 
white onion with two whole cloves stuck in it, one carrot, a 
bunch of parsley, and a four-pound piece of salt pork — a streak 
of fat and a streak of lean. Before adding the pork, soak it for 
two hours in tepid water. Boil all slowly for two hours. Take 
the pork out and let it drain. Also remove the onion, carrots, 
and parsley. Strain off the liquid from the beans. Pour them 
into a hollow baking dish — an earthen one is the better — with 
two tablespoonfuls of molasses over them. Score the fatty 



174 MBS. seely's cook book 

side of the pork. Press it down in the centre of the beans. 
Bake one hour in a moderate oven. Occasionally baste the pork 
with the gravy from the beans. Serve in the baking dish. 
Have it either hot or cold. 

Boiled Ham 

Soak the ham twenty-four hours, or more if large, or dry 
and hard. Put it in cold water and set on the back of the 
stove with a few soup vegetables or herbs. Cook very gently 
from eight to ten hours. The ham should stay on the stove four 
or five hours before it really starts to cook. It should then 
simmer very gently. Take up the ham ; and if you have time, 
let it get cold. Remove the skin, trim neatly, and put it on to 
braise for one hour in Sherry or Champagne. Take up, bake 
about thirty minutes, and serve with red currant jelly on the 
top. 

Baked Ham with Hot Sauce 

Remove the thigh-bone of the ham and let it soak in cold 
water for twenty-four hours before cooking. Then put it in 
a boiler and boil gradually for three hours. Take it out and 
remove the rind. Place it in a tightly covered pan with a few 
carrots, onions, blade of mace, whole cloves, allspice, bay leaf, 
and one bunch of cooking celery, and add about four quarts of 
stock or water. Place the pan in the oven and be careful that 
your lid fits closely. Let the ham steam slowly for three hours. 
Remove it from the oven and let it cool in the liquor. If the 
ham is served hot, send it to the table as soon as taken from 
the oven. The above is for a ham weighing from eighteen to 
twenty pounds. 

Hot Sauce for Baked Ham 

Brown a little flour and butter in the oven until it becomes 
rather a dark brown. Then remove all the fat from the stock 
in which the ham was cooked. Strain it and add the browned

Wash well a fine ham. Soak it over night in clear spring 
water, and in the morning set it to boil in a kettle of hot cider. 
The kettle should be porcelain, so that the acid of the cider will 
not eat the metal and give a metallic taste to the meat. Boil 
slowly five to eight hours, that is, until the ham is thoroughly 
cooked, and set to cool in the liquid in which it is boiled. 

The cider flavor is finer if a barrel of cider is left out doors 
to freeze, and after it is about half frozen through the heart of 
the cider is drawn off for this boiling. This was done for hams 
used at a supper given by a lawyer to forty or fifty friends. 
Some of these men were gourmets, and they all marvelled at 
the " Champagne taste " of the delicious meat. A small bag of 
spices — cloves, mace, cinnamon — thrown in the boiling cider 
gives added flavor. 

Boiled Ham a la Chamberlin 

Put the ham in a tub of cold water, fleshy part downward, 
skin part up, the night before boiling. Next morning put the 
ham in a large kettle or pot of cold water to boil. Let the 
water get hot gradually and continue to cook the ham in a 
slow boil scarcely more than a simmer. At the end of five 
hours take the ham out, throw the water out of the pot, and 
fill it with fresh cold water. Put the ham back immediately 
and let it simmer or boil slowly five hours more. Then add, 
according to the money you wish to spend, a gallon of vinegar, 
or a gallon of claret, or Burgundy, or Champagne, then simmer 
or boil for three hours more. Then take the ham off, skin it, 
and put in a cool place; to prevent the ham from tearing, it is 
always safe to sew a piece of cotton cloth tightly round the 



176 MBS. seely's cook book 

ham so as to fit it as close as a glove. This will keep the meat 
firm and guard against the neglect of the cook in letting the 
water boil too fast. 

Virginia Ham 

Put the ham in bucket of tepid water and allow it to stand 
all night. In morning put in pot of cold water and allow it 
to come to simmer, not boiling, and stew five hours. If wine 
flavor is wished, make a boiling mixture of one quart of Cham- 
pagne, one quart of Burgundy, a pinch of mace, and a pinch of 
cloves. Let the ham stand, after taking it off the stove, in its 
juice twenty-four hours. 

Ham Mousse 

Cut a slice of raw ham in pieces, rejecting all fat, and put 
it in cold water for two hours, changing the water quite often. 
Then drain, dry in a clean towel. Scrape with a sharp knife. 
Put through a very fine puree sieve. Take the breast of a 
nice roasted chicken, scrape that also, and put through a sieve. 
Then weigh chicken, also the ham. There should be four 
ounces of each, good weight. Put both in wooden bowl, and 
with a potato masher pound them to a paste. Whip the whites 
of two eggs and work in with the masher. Set to cool. Make 
a sauce of one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful of 
flour. Let both boil, and then add one cup of well-seasoned 
chicken broth, in which one onion, carrot, celery, whole pepper, 
and blade of mace have been cooked. Add one-half teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one-fourth teaspoon of pepper, a pinch of cayenne, 
and the yolks of two eggs whipped with a tablespoonful of 
cream. Set aside to cool. When cold, add it to the meat. 
Whip half a pint of cream and add to the mixture. Care must 
be taken not to whip your cream too much; it may separate. 
Be sure you have it well flavored before you add the cream. 
Set in the ice-box a few minutes. Decorate your mould, and be 



MEATS 177 

sure it is well buttered so that the decorations stick to it, then 
put on ice to harden. When well chilled, put in your force- 
meat, giving the mould a few knocks on the table to settle the 
forcemeat to get it even so that it will not break when dished. 
Thirty minutes before serving, put your mould in pan of hot 
water. Put buttered paper over it, and poach until it is firm 
to the touch. Serve with princess sauce. 

This mousse may be served hot or cold. It can be done 
with all chicken or all ham, according to the taste. Be sure 
you weigh and measure correctly. Measure your half-pint of 
cream before you whip it. 

Sucking Pig a la Russe with Horseradish Sauce 

Boil a fat sucking pig in a soup you have made of vegeta- 
bles. To make the soup, use vegetables such as usually go to 
the making of vegetable soup, — carrots, turnips, etc., — a season- 
ing of onion, not forgetting a bouquet of majoram, thyme, sum- 
mer savory, etc. Vinegar should be added to the broth, and 
therefore a porcelain kettle had best be used. When the pig is 
thoroughly cooked — its tenderness is tested by a skewer or 
fork — carve it, sprinkle with parsley, pour the horseradish 
sauce given below over it, and serve. 

Horseradish Sauce 

Grate the horseradish, fry in butter mixed with a little 
bouillon, add several tablespoons of rich cream, and cook until 
tender. Set off the stove, add the yolks of a couple of eggs, 
warm again, but do not boil. 

This delicious sauce is, in Russia, also often served with 
corned beef and beef au naturel. 

Roast Pig 

Select a pig about three weeks old. After it is thoroughly 
cleaned, washed, and dried, rub the inside with one teaspoonful 



178 3£RS. seely's jjook book 

of salt. Fill it with bread forcemeat and sew up the open- 
ing. Press the fore feet forward and the hind feet backward. 
Skewer them in position, and place in a pan. Rub the entire 
body with melted butter, dredge it with salt and a little white 
pepper. Cover the ears and tail with buttered paper to keep 
them from crisping, and place a piece of wood in the mouth to 
keep it open. Bake in a moderate oven for three hours and 
a half, basting it frequently with melted butter. About one- 
half hour before it is thoroughly cooked remove the buttered 
paper that the ears and tail may become brown. When cooked 
arrange on a platter, place a red apple or a piece of lemon in 
the mouth, and serve with ajDple sauce. 

Roast Pork 

Select four pounds of the loin of pork. Rub well with two 
tablespoonfuls of salt and one teaspoonful of pepper. Let it 
stand for two or three hours. Place it in a pan with a half cup 
of water, and roast in a moderate oven for two hours. Baste 
often with the drippings. When done, the meat should be 
almost white. Serve on a hot platter, with apple sauce in a 
separate dish. Make a thick gravy with the contents of drip- 
ping pan. Strain and serve in a sauce-boat. 

Crown of Pork 
Trim and shape ten or twelve pork chops into a crown. 
Fill the centre with a mixture of sausage meat and bread 
crumbs moistened with Qgg. Roast in a moderate oven for 
one hour and three-quarters. Fry in butter fifty whole, small 
onions until a light brown, then cook them in stock until ten- 
der. Place some in the centre of the pork, the rest used for a 
garnish. Serve with Espagnole sauce. 

Indiana Mock Goose 
Parboil a leg of pork and take off the skin. Put it in the 
oven to roast with a little water in the pan, and baste often 



MEATS 179 

with a mixture of butter, minced or powdered sage, pepper, 
salt, bread crumbs rubbed fine, and finely minced onion. A 
goose stuffing may be inserted under the knuckle skin, and the 
dish may be garnished with balls of fried stuffing. Serve with 
sour apple sauce or with gooseberry jam a little sweetened. 

Mock Duck 

Have your butcher split lengthwise a pork tenderloin. 
Make for it the same stuffing you would make for duck. Sew 
the tenderloin together, enclosing the stuffing, and roast, bast- 
ing frequently. Before serving draw out the thread, and send 
to the table garnished with quarters of apple cooked without 
sugar. 

Walnut Croquettes 

Stir in a double boiler a pint of bread crumbs, with enough 
milk to make a thick smooth batter, and add a teaspoon of salt 
and a full cup and a half of chopped walnuts. Moisten witli a 
couple of tablespoons of brandy or Sherry, and stir in the well- 
beaten yolks of four eggs. Take the mixture from the fire and 
let it get cold, then form croquettes. Dip them in egg^ and 
then in bread crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat. Serve with any 
sauce to your taste.

POULTRY AND GAME 

Chicken Gumbo 

Cut two cliickens in pieces and fry until a delicate brown 
in half a cupful of salt pork fat, — obtained by frying half a 
pound of salt pork slowly. When the chicken is cooked, take 
it up and put it into a large stewpan. Into the fat in which 
the chicken was fried put a large onion cut in thin slices and 
fry slowly for ten minutes. Then add one quart of okra, cut 
fine, five sliced tomatoes, and two sprigs of parsley. Fry all 
these ingredients rather slowly for one-half an hour, then add 
them to the fried chicken. Pour into the dish a pint and a half 
of boiling water and season with one-half teaspoonful of pepper 
and two scant tablespooiifuls of salt. Stew slowly for two 
hours. Then add a cupful of cream and one cup of boiled 
rice. Taste, to be sure there is enough seasoning, and if tliere 
is, boil up once and serve. When fresh okra cannot be obtained, 
one can of the article may be substituted. The chicken may 
be a year or more old. A dash of cayenne instead of white 
pepper may be used. 

Marinade of Chicken 

Take two medium -sized boiled chickens, when cold cut 
them up, remove the skin, and place them in a hollow dish with 
salt, pepper, a sliced onion, chopped parsley, two glasses of oil, 
and the juice of two lemons. Mix them well and let them 
steep for one hour. Fifteen minutes before serving, drain; 
then dip each piece in a flour batter and drop them one by one

POULTRY AND GAME 181 

in deep hot fat. Give them a nice color, drain on brown 
paper, sprinkle a little salt over them. Dish on a folded nap- 
kin, surrounded with fried parsley, and serve with a bowl of 
tomato sauce. 

Flour Batter for Marinade 

One-half pound sifted flour, yolks of three eggs, and cold 
water to desired thickness. Beat the whites of tlie eggs to a 
stiff froth and thoroughly mix with the batter. 

Ballottines of Legs of Fowls 

Cut open eight fowls' legs, remove all the bones and sinews. 
Spread the meat on the table, season Avith pepper and salt, and 
place a tablespoonful of forcemeat, seasoned with herbs, in the 
centre of each. Sew them in an oblong or oval shape. Place 
a few slices of onion, carrot, and celery in a stewpan, arrange 
the ballottines on them and cover with thin slices of fat bacon. 
Moisten them half their height with broth, cover with greased 
paper, place the cover on the pan, and cook them slowly in the 
oven for half an hour. Baste them frequently. When cooked, 
remove, and put them in press between two dishes until they 
are cold. Trim them and place in a saucepan with a little 
broth and cover with greased paper ; let them simmer slowly 
in the oven for fifteen minutes. Cover them with a glaze, dish 
them in a circle, with a braised lettuce between each one. Fill 
the centre with a jardiniere of vegetables. Pour Espagnole 
sauce around the entree and serve. 

Fried Chicken with Cream Sauce 

Singe, draw, and cut two tender chickens in quarters. 
Crack the main bones, flatten slightly, and put in a saucepan 
with five ounces of melted butter, a little salt, and white pep- 
per. Cover, place over a brisk fire, and fry a light brown on 
each side. Drain off most of the butter, sprinkle with one 
ounce of well-sifted flour, mix Avell, and add one and one-half 



182 MRS. seelt's cook book 

pints of cream ; cover and boil ten minutes. Remove the 
chicken and to the sauce add two small pats of butter and the 
juice of half a lemon. Pour this over the chicken, sprinkle 
with chopped parsley, and serve very hot. 

Chicken Croquettes 

Chop and pound to a powder one cup of cold chicken — the 
white meat. Season with salt, celery salt, and cayenne. Add 
one cup of thick cream sauce, or more if the thickening will 
absorb it. Set away to cool. Then shape the chicken in the 
form you wish, roll the croquettes in fine bread crumbs, then 
in beaten egg^ then in bread crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat. 

Chicken Cromeskies 
To a tablespoon of butter in a frying pan add a teacup of 
milk thickened with a tablespoon of flour. To this add a large 
cup of minced chicken, seasoned with minced mushrooms and 
parsley, a teaspoon of finely minced onion, and a little salt, and 
let the whole cook up. Take slices of a boiled ham or slices of 
uncooked bacon, roll portions of the chicken mixture in them, 
fixing each piece with a skewer or tying each about with fine 
twine. Dip in a frying batter or in the white of an egg and 
fry in deep hot fat. Garnish with sprigs of parsley and serve 
hot. If mushrooms are not at hand, a little catsup may be used 
instead. 

Chicken a la Marengo 

Singe, wash, and dry thoroughly two good-sized fat and 
tender chickens. Cut them up as for fricassee. Put the pieces 
in a pan with two ounces of butter and one gill of olive oil, 
salt, white pepper, a dash of cayenne, and a little grated nut- 
meg. Fry over a brisk fire until slightly brown on both sides. 
Drain off part of the fat, add a tablespoonful of chopped shal- 
lots, one-fourth cup sliced mushrooms, and a bruised clove of 
garlic. Fry three minutes longer, then stir in half a pint of 



POULTRY AND GAME 183 

tomato sauce, half a pint of Espagnole sauce, two wine-glasses 
of Sherry, and a little broth. Cover and let all simmer gently 
for fifteen minutes. Dish in pyramid form. Fry separately, in 
very hot sweet oil, eight eggs, a delicate brown and soft. Drain 
them on cloth, place them round the chicken, and serve. 

Poulade a la Royale 

Drain, singe, and bone a nice young fowl and stuff it with the 
following forcemeat : One sweetbread minced fine and rubbed 
through a sieve. Two ounces of raw veal also rubbed through 
a sieve, two ounces of raw ham also rubbed through a sieve, four 
mushrooms pounded well and put through a sieve. Put all in 
a mortar and pound to a pulp. Mix with the whites of two eggs. 

Make a sauce of the following : Melt one ounce of butter 
in saucepan, add a teaspoonful of chopped onion and let it 
boil for two minutes, then add one ounce of flour and let it 
come to a boil. Add half a pint of chicken broth, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, a pinch 
of cayenne. Let it boil five minutes. Whip the yolks of two 
eggs with two tablespoonfuls of cream. Put the sauce in a 
double boiler, add eggs and cream. Do not let it boil, but 
continue stirring until it gets thick. Remove at once and set 
away to cool. When cold, add it to the forcemeat. Draw 
inside the legs and wings of the fowl, put the forcemeat in the 
centre of it, sew up the back, giving it its full shape and allow- 
ing room for the forcemeat to swell. Put the fowl in a kettle 
and braise it one hour. Then put it in the oven to brown. Serve 
with a puree of chestnuts in a plain border or in rosettes round 
the dish. Also serve a rich brown sauce with it. 

Fricassee a la Dauphine 

Prepare and cook a chicken for a fricassee. Trim the pieces 
and place them on a dish. Reduce the stock or sauce to the 
consistency of Allemande sauce, add a liaison of four eggs, 



184 3fRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

butter, and cream. When this is thoroughly mixed, strain it 
through a wet cloth. Dip each of the pieces of chicken in it 
and replace them on the dish. When the sauce has become 
set, roll the pieces in fine bread crumbs, then in beaten egg^ 
and again in fine bread crumbs. Arrange in frying basket and 
fry in deep hot lard until a light brown. When done, drain 
on brown paper. Arrange them on a napkin. Garnish with 
fried parsley. Serve with white Italienne sauce in a separate 
dish, or else arrange on a platter without the napkin and pour 
Bechamel or Allemande sauce over them. 

Chicken Curry- 
Select a tender chicken weighing about three or four pounds. 
After singeing and cleaning, wash well and soak it in cold water 
for ten minutes. Drain and cut into square pieces. Put the 
pieces into a saucepan with enough hot water to cover them. 
Add two pinches of salt, one of white pepper, a little grated 
nutmeg, a bouquet, and six small, white onions. Cook over a 
moderate fire for forty-five minutes, keeping it well skimmed. 
Drain off the broth and set the saucepan where the chicken 
will keep warm. Put half a pint of white sauce — butter and 
flour — in a saucepan with all the broth and mix thoroughly. 
Take one tablespoonful of curry which is blended with water, 
the yolks of four eggs, and the juice of half a lemon. Beat all 
together thoroughly and gradually stir it into the sauce. Do 
not let it boil. Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve 
immediately. Garnish the dish with a border of boiled rice. 

Boned Broiled Chicken with Mushroom Sauce 

Bone three young chickens, each weighing one and one-half 
pounds. Season with salt, pepper, and a little lemon juice, 
and put in a cool place until wanted. Peel one pound of 
mushrooms and quarter them. Make a sauce of the following: 
Melt one tablespoonful of butter, add one tablespoonful of 




BOXED CHICKEN.

flour, and let the mixture come to a boil, and then add half a 
pint of clear, rich consomme. When it boils, add mushrooms; 
let them simmer five minutes, and then add half a cup of rich 
cream. Broil your chickens, brush them over with melted 
butter, and set them in a pan in the oven to keep hot. Have 
some nice pieces of toast, cut the chickens in halves, and put 
them on the toast around the platter. Put the mushrooms and 
sauce in the centre. Serve very hot. Garnish with parsley. 

Fricassee of Chicken with Mushrooms 

Select two good-sized plump chickens. After they have 
been drawn, singe them and cut them up in small members or 
joints in the following manner: First remove the wings at the 
second joint and the legs at the knotty bend of the first joint; 
then take hold of the chicken with the left hand, and, with a 
sharp knife in the right, make two parallel cuts lengthwise on 
the back about an inch and a half apart, so as partly to detach, 
or at least mark out where the legs and wings are to be 
removed; cut both legs and fillets, then remove the thigh bone; 
separate the back and breast, trim these, then cut the back 
across in two pieces. Steep the pieces in a pan of tepid water 
for ten or fifteen minutes. Occasionally squeeze each piece, so 
as to extract the blood. Next sprinkle the bottom of a sauce- 
pan with thin slices of onion and carrot, a little celery, three 
cloves, twelve peppercorns, a blade of mace, and a bouquet. 
Place the pieces of chicken in close and neat order upon the 
vegetables. Moisten with a quart of boiling broth — if not at 
hand, water will do. Let them boil gently for half an hour, 
or until sufficiently tender. Keep the pan covered, so they 
will steam as well as boil. Remove the pieces with a skimmer, 
drain, and then plunge in cold water. Wash and drain them 
upon a cloth. Trim and place them in a saucepan and set 
away in a cool place. Strain the broth the chickens were 
cooked in. Melt two ounces of butter in saucepan and stir in 



186 MRS, seelt's cook book 

two ounces of flour. Stir over the fire for tliree minutes, but 
do not let it brown. Remove from the range and stir in the 
chicken broth. Mix together until it is a smooth sauce. Add 
the mushroom trimmings, that is, the stems. Stir the sauce 
over the fire until it boils, then set it where it will boil slowly 
for half an hour. When it has boiled the full length of time, 
skim it thoroughly, and then continue boiling until it becomes 
the proper thickness. Then stir into it a liaison of four eggs, 
mixed with a little butter and a little cream. In making a 
liaison, you use twice as much water as you have Qgg yolks — 
the butter keeps it from curdling the sauce. Stir over the fire 
until it nearly boils, then strain it through a wet cloth. Pour 
over the chicken which is in the saucepan and add half a 
bottle of button mushrooms. Heat thoroughly, but do not let 
it boil. Dish it up as follows: First, put the pieces of the 
back in the centre of the dish, place the legs at the angles, the 
bones pointed inwardly. Next place the fillets upon these, then 
set the pieces of breast on top. Pour the sauce over the 
chicken. Arrange the mushrooms in groups, and surround all 
with eight or ten glazed croutons. 

Boiled Chicken and Tongue 

Draw and truss two young chickens and rub them thor- 
oughly with the juice of one lemon. Tie two or three slices of 
fat pork or bacon over the breast and wrap them up in a 
nicely floured cloth. Place them in a stewpan with one quart 
of consomme. Bring them to a boil and then let them simmer 
gently until done. Do not let them boil an}^ longer than is 
necessary. To test: Try the wings with a fork. Let them 
stand in the pot for fifteen minutes. Have a nice beef tongue 
boiled tender. Let this also stand in its liquor. Have some 
fine spinach rubbed through a puree sieve, seasoned well with 
pepper, salt, butter, and two tablespoonfuls of cream. Heat it 
thoroughly and let it stand in the saucepan. Set your boiled 



POULTRY AND GAME 187 

fowl in the centre of a platter and put the spinach around it. 
Cut the tongue in the shape of cutlets and lay tlie pieces on 
top of the spinach around the platter. Make a sauce of the 
stock in which the chicken was cooked. To make the sauce, 
melt one tablespoonful of butter. When it comes to a boil, 
add one tablespoonful of flour. Let this come to a boil and 
then add one cup and a half of stock. Boil five minutes, 
season to taste, and add one glass of Madeira wine. Pour 
some of the sauce over the chicken. Serve the rest in a sauce- 
boat. The chickens may be carved before you dish them, 
placing them together on the platter, or they may be sent to 
the table whole. 

Creamed Chicken 

Clean and cut up in neat pieces two chickens or fowls. 
Put them on to boil. Before they are done, pare enough pota- 
toes to go nicely with the chickens. Cut them in pieces not 
more than two and a half inches in diameter, lay them on the 
chicken, and let them boil until done. Then take up the pota- 
toes in a dish by themselves. Pour a pint (or, if washed, more) 
of sweet cream over the chickens. Let it heat and then 
thicken with a scant tablespoonful of flour dissolved in a small 
half cup of milk. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and fresh 
butter. If the cream is not rich, more butter will be required. 

Chicken Canapes 
Cut the meat of a cold chicken in pieces as for chicken 
salad. Heat in a double boiler a cup and a half of rich milk 
and in this stir a tablespoonful of corn-starch, rubbed smooth, 
with the same quantity of butter, half a teaspoon of minced 
onion and of minced parsley, and salt and white pepper to 
taste. In this sauce simmer the chicken about ten minutes, 
and serve on slices of bread toasted or fried in hot fat, or 
dipped in butter and browned in the oven. Stick in each bit 
of bread a tree or two of parsley.

Walled Chicken 

This dish is made of one large fowl, or two rather small 
ones, eight medium-sized potatoes, two eggs, four tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, half a cupful of hot milk, three cups of chicken 
stock, — the water in which the chicken was boiled, — one table- 
spoonful of finely chopped onion, one sprig of parsle}^ one slice 
of carrot, one bay leaf, two generous tablespoonfuls of flour, 
salt and pepper to suit the taste. It is best to boil the fowl 
the day before it is to be used. In doing this, clean it and put 
it in a saucepan, breast down. Cover with boiling water. 
When it commences to boil, skim it, and set the kettle back on 
the stove where the chicken will simply simmer until tender — 
from two hours and a half to three hours. Set the fowl away 
to cool in the water in which it was boiled. When cool, free 
it from skin and bone, and cut it in pieces suitable for serving. 
Season with salt and white pepper. Fifty minutes before 
serving time peel the potatoes, put in a saucepan, and cover 
them with boiling water. When they have been cooking for 
fifteen minutes, prepare the chicken in the following manner : 
Put three tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying pan with the 
vegetables and herbs. Cook slowly for five minutes, then add 
the flour. Stir until smooth and frothy, but not long enough to 
permit it to get brown. Gradually add the cold chicken stock, 
stirring all the time. When the liquor boils up, add one-eighth 
of a teaspoonful of pepper and one teaspoonful of salt, and 
simmer for five minutes. Put the seasoned chicken in a sauce- 
pan, strain the sauce over it, cover and simmer for ten minutes, 
then set where it will keep hot until serving time. When the 
potatoes are cooked, pour off all the water. Place the milk in 
a saucepan on the range, mash the potatoes until smooth and 
light, then add the milk, one tablespoonful of butter, and a 
teaspoonful of salt. Beat the w^hites of the eggs to a stiff 
froth and stir into the mixture. Have a stone platter very 



POULTRY AND GAME 189 

hot, arrange the mashed potato as a border around the centre 
of the dish. Beat the yolks of the eggs with two tablespoon- 
fuls of water. Spread it over the potato and phice in the oven 
for ten minutes. At the end of that time pour the chicken 
into the centre of the border. Garnish with bits of parsley. 
Any kind of cold meat, poultry, game, or fish may be served 
in this manner. 

Jellied Chicken 

Select a chicken or fowl weighing three pounds after it has 
been cleaned. Also have one-third of a box of gelatine, one 
slice of onion, one slice of carrot, one bay leaf, one whole clove, 
some hot and cold water, and salt and pepper in quantities to 
be determined by one's own taste. Wash the fowl, put it into 
a deep stewpan with boiling water to cover it. Let the water 
again come to a boil, then skim carefully, and set the pan where 
the water will only bubble until the meat becomes tender. 
When the fowl becomes tender, take it from the water and set 
away to cool ; also set the water where it will cool. Soak the 
gelatine in one gill of cold water for two hours. When the 
chicken liquor has become cold, skim it and pour one pint and 
a half of it in a saucepan with the clove, carrot, onion, and bay 
leaf. Let them simmer for ten minutes, then add a grain of 
cayenne and a level spoonful of salt and the soaked gelatine. 
After straining this liquid through a cloth, pour a thin layer 
into a mould, and set away to harden. Free the cold fowl of 
skin, fat, and bones, and cut in thin strips, season well with 
salt and pepper, lay them in the mould. When the jelly 
hardens, pour the liquid jelly over the meat and again set the 
mould away. At serving time, dip it in warm water and turn 
out on a flat dish. Jellied chicken may be made of the remains 
of cold roast chicken or turkey or boiled fowl. When there is 
no stock on hand, the bones of the chicken should be covered 
with water and simmered for several hours in order to obtain a 
supply. 



190 MRS. 



Pressed Chicken 



Singe and clean a medium-sized chicken. Disjoint it and 
put it in a saucepan with hardly enough water to cover it. Boil 
until the meat slips away from the bones and the gristly parts 
are soft. While hot, remove the skin and separate the meat 
into medium-sized pieces. Mix the white and dark meat to- 
gether. Skim the grease from the broth the chicken was boiled 
in. Season with salt, white pepper, lemon juice, and celery salt. 
Boil until it is reduced one-half. Strain to free it from the bones, 
and mix with the meat. Butter a mould and decorate the 
bottom and sides with hard-boiled egg and thin slices of lemon. 
Pack the meat, press it down, and put weight on top. Keep in 
a cold place until wanted. Unmould and serve with a garnish 
of quartered lemons and parsley. 

Galantine of Chicken 

Clean and split a nice chicken down the back, bone it, and 
remove the legs and wings. Spread it flat on the table and fill 
with the following forcemeat: Take one pound of fat fresh pork 
and two pounds of veal and the meat from the chicken legs and 
wings. Scrape and pound in a mortar, then rub through a 
puree sieve. Add the whites of two eggs and season with salt, 
white pepper, and a little grated nutmeg. Have at hand some 
nice thin strips of bacon, the same length as the chicken ; also 
have boiled tongue cut in the same manner, and some truffles 
cut in small pieces. Spread the chicken with a layer of force- 
meat, then a layer of bacon, and then a layer of tongue. Sprinkle 
with pieces of truffle. When the chicken is refilled, fold it and 
sew up the back. Wrap it in a clean cloth and tie at both ends. 
Place in a pan and cover with good stock. Add two carrots, 
two onions, a little celery, and a little thyme; also the bones of 
the chicken. Boil slowly for two hours and let it cool in the 
stock. Take three pints of the stock the chicken was cooked in, 



POULTRY AND GAME 191 

add one box of Cox's gelatine which has previously been dis- 
solved, and one egg. Mix thoroughly and stir over the fire 
until it comes to a boil. Strain through a wet cloth. Cover 
the bottom of a mould with the liquid. When it becomes hard, 
garnish with egg and truffles cut in fancy shapes, then place 
the chicken in the mould, pour in a little more of the liquid. 
When the chicken is firm, fill the mould and place on ice until 
served. Unmould on a dish and garnish with the jelly cut in 
small dice or chopped. 

Terrapin Chicken 
Cut one quart of cold cooked chicken in very small pieces 
and mix with two chicken livers and three hard-boiled eggs 
chopped rather coarse. Sprinkle all with one level teaspoonful 
of salt, one-third of a teaspoonful of pepper, and a dash of grated 
nutmeg. Put three tablespoonfuls of butter in a pan. After it 
has melted, add two tablespoonfuls of flour and stir until the 
mixture is smooth. Set the pan where there is less heat and 
gradually add one cupful of chicken stock. Place it over a 
quick fire and stir constantly for three or four minutes. Then 
from one cupful of cream remove four tablespoonfuls, stir the 
rest into the mixture. Then add the chicken, etc., and cook all 
together slowly for ten minutes. Beat the yolks of two eggs, 
add the four tablespoonfuls of cream, and stir into the saucepan. 
Stir for a minute. At the end of that time remove the pan from 
the fire, stir in four tablespoonfuls of Sherry and one table- 
spoonful of lemon juice. Mix thoroughly and serve at once. 

Chicken and Rice Pie 

Select a fowl weighing about five pounds. Clean and wash 
it thoroughly. Cut into joints and put in a stewpan with 
three pints of boiling water, one slice of onion, one slice of 
carrot, and two whole cloves. Let it simmer until tender. It 
ought to cook tender in one hour and a half if you select a 



192 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

young fowl. If it is tough, it may take three hours before it 

cooks tender. When it is cooked, add one-half teaspoonful 

of white pepper and two teaspoonfuls of salt. Set aside until 

time for cooking with rice. Wash and pick over one cup and 

a half of rice. Drain and put it on to cook with three quarts 

of boiling water. When it has been cooked for ten minutes 

add two level teaspoonfuls of salt. Cook ten minutes longer, 

and then turn into a colander, and drain thoroughly. Then 

mix it with one teaspoonful more of salt, two well-beaten eggs, 

half a cupful of butter, and half a pint of milk. Place in a deep 

baking dish a layer of chicken, then a layer of rice mixture, then 

of chicken, and so on, finishing with the rice. Cover the rice 

with one pint of the stock the chicken was boiled in. Bake in 

a moderate oven for half an hour. Serve in the dish it was 

baked in. 

Chicken Pie 

Singe and clean a chicken weighing about four or four and 
one-half pounds. Cut into twelve pieces. Cover with water 
and let them soak for thirty minutes. Wash, drain, and cover 
with water, season with salt and white pepper, a bunch of pars- 
ley, six small onions, and five ounces of salt pork cut in small 
squares. Cook for three-quarters of an hour. Skim often. 
Stir in one pint of raw potato cut in pieces and four scant 
tablespoonfuls of flour blended with cold water. Stir con- 
stantly until it boils, then cook it for ten minutes. Remove 
the bunch of parsley. Place the rest in a deep baking dish, 
moisten the edges with water, cover the top with pastry — 
some prefer the puff paste. Brush over with a beaten egg. 
Cut a hole in the centre. Bake in brisk oven for twenty 
minutes or until the pastry is done.

the work into three parts. To make the forcemeat use the 
white meat of four medium-sized uncooked chickens, one pint 
of cream, one-half pint of stale bread crumbs, free of crust, six 
tablespoonfuls of butter, one blade of mace, one tablespoonful 
of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of white pepper, and the 
whites of four eggs. Chop the chicken meat fine, put it in a 
mortar, and pound it fine, then rub it through a puree sieve. 
There should be one pint of the prepared meat. Mix the bread, 
cream, and mace together. Cook slowly for twenty minutes. 
Then remove the mace, and with a spoon work the bread and 
cream to a smooth paste. Add the butter, salt, pepper, and 
meat, and finally add the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth. Beat the mixture until it is thoroughly blended. Then 
set away to cool. To make the filling use three gills of cream, 
one pint of cooked chicken cut in small cubes, four tablespoon- 
fuls of chopped mushrooms, one tablespoonful of flour, one heap- 
ing teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of white 
pepper, and one tablespoonful of chopped truffles. Reserve half 
a cup of cream. Put the rest on to boil. Blend the flour with 
the half cup of cream and stir into the boiling cream. Boil for 
one minute, then add the chicken and other ingredients. Cook 
for three minutes longer. If desired, flavor with a few drops of 
onion juice. Butter the mould or moulds, and after dotting 
the bottom and sides with pieces of truffle, line them with the 
forcemeat, being careful to have every part well covered. The 
side near the rim will require as thick a covering as any part 
of the mould. Now almost fill the mould or moulds with the 
chicken preparation and cover with the forcemeat, being care- 
ful to put in only a little at a time, and always work from the 
outer edge until the centre is reached. Be careful to have the 
top smooth. If at all round it will not be steady when turned 
on a dish. Place the mould in a deep pan. Pour in enough 
warm water to come almost to the rim. Cover the mould with 
buttered paper and bake in a moderate oven for twenty-five

minutes. It must cook slowly. When quite firm to the touch, 
turn on a hot dish and serve with Bechamel sauce. 

Timbale a la Hyde 

Boil a young fowl, take off the meat, and cut it in pieces. Take 
two ounces of Parmesan cheese grated, one small shallot chopped 
fine, pepper and salt, and make about half a pint of good rich 
white sauce with cream and consomme, and mix with the chicken 
and cheese. Add a little well-cooked and drained small maca- 
roni and two sliced tomatoes. Line a mould with good paste 
(six ounces of butter to eight ounces of flour or trimmings ©f 
puff paste will do), put the mixture in, fold the paste over the 
top, put a flat weight on, and bake about one hour. Serve with 
good rich brown or white sauce. 

Chicken a la Parisienne 
Use the fillets of four chickens, one small can of truffles, one 
can of mushrooms, eight thin slices of red tongue, the white of 
one egg^ one pint of consomme, half a cupful of clarified butter, 
one gill of glaze, one tablespoonful of salt, one pint of supreme 
sauce, and one pint and a half of chicken liver forcemeat. Fillet 
the chickens and separate the under fillets from the large ones. 
Curve them all the same way. Pour three tablespoonfuls of 
clarified butter into a frying pan and arrange the large fillets 
in the batter, having the smooth side up, and curving them all 
the same way. Sprinkle them with salt. Arrange the under 
fillets in another pan with clarified butter the same way as the 
larger ones. Cut two or three truflles in thin slices and with 
small fancy vegetable cutters stamp out stars and various shapes. 
Beat the white of the egg until well broken, but not light. 
Brush a little on each of the large fillets and decorate them 
with the fancy shapes of truflles. When all are done, brush 
lightly with the white of the egg. Let this dry. Cover with 
a sheet of buttered paper and set in cool place until time for 



POULTRY AND GAMS 195 

cooking. Treat the small fillets in the same way, using red 
tongue in place of truffles. Put the liver forcemeat in a small 
and plain buttered border mould. Set it in cool place until 
time for cooking. Cut seven slices of tongue in fillet shape. 
Put these in a cool place. Make some supreme sauce. Open 
the mushrooms. Chop the remainder of the truffles rather fine. 
Half an hour before serving put the mould of forcemeat into a 
pan with water two-thirds as high as the mould. Cover with 
buttered paper and place in a moderate oven. In ten minutes 
open the oven door. Take the paper from the fillets and baste 
them with three or four tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Re- 
place the papers, arrange in pans, and place in oven with the 
forcemeat. Cook twenty minutes, leaving the oven door open. 
While these are cooking put the pieces of tongue into a small 
stewpan with half the glaze and half a gill of consomme. Cook 
for ten minutes. Reserve one gill of the supreme sauce and mix 
the chopped truffles with the remainder. Strain the liquid from 
mushrooms, add them to the sauce. Drain the butter from the 
fillets. Remove the papers and pour half of the reserved supreme 
sauce over each pan of fillets. Cook this on top of the stove for 
four minutes. Do not let it boil. While this is cooking turn 
the border of forcemeat on a flat dish. Pour the consomme 
from the pieces of tongue. Add tlie remainder of the glaze 
to them. Arrange the large fillets and the tongue alternately 
around the border of forcemeat. Pour the mushrooms and sauce 
in the centre and arrange the under fillets on top. Serve at once. 

Roast Capon with Truffles 

Select a nice, meaty capon, singe and clean it, and fill it with 
truffles prepared as follows : Peel, slice, and remove the stringy 
part from one quart of truffles. Let them stand in their own 
juice. Melt one pound of butter with salt and pepper, three 
bay leaves, two sliced shallots, a clove of garlic, and a sprig of 
thyme. Stir while the butter is melting. Rub through a col- 



196 MRS, SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

ander over the truffles. Mix them and let them stand until 
thoroughly cold. Fill the capon, make it a good shape, and 
sew both ends so the truffles will not come out. Cover with 
thin strips of larding pork. Wrap in a thick sheet of white 
paper which is well oiled, and bake in an oven for one hour and 
a half. Baste frequently with melted butter. Remove paper 
and pork. Serve with a gravy made of the strained liquid the 
capon was cooked in and a little broth. 

Descaides, a Jewish Dish 

Take the livers of chickens or any other poultry and stew 
them gently in a little good gravy seasoned with a little onion, 
mushrooms, pepper, and salt. When the livers are tender, mince 
them on a pasteboard or in a mortar. Return them to the 
saucepan and stir in the yolks of one or two eggs, according 
to the quantity of liver. By the time the mixture is thick 
have rounds of toast ready on a hot dish and serve the minced 
liver upon the toast. Garnish with parsley. 

Chicken Liver Cromeskies 

Cut the chicken livers in two and season with salt and pep- 
per. Fold each piece of liver in a slice of bacon, cut very thin. 
Fasten with a small skewer and broil over a good fire for ten 
or fifteen minutes. Serve hot on a piece of hot toast after draw- 
ing out the skewers. 

Calf's liver may be cooked the same way if it is especially 
delicate and tender. 

Roast Turkey with Oysters 

Singe and clean a medium-sized tender turkey, wipe dry, 
and stuff with the following mixture : Four breakfast cupfuls of 
oyster cracker crumbs mixed with four breakfast cupfuls of bread 
crumbs. Stir in the liquor from five dozen oysters, one-half 
pound of melted butter, and two beaten eggs. Put in the oys- 




BOXED TURKEY

TRUSSED TURKEY, 



POULTRY AND GAME 197 

ters, season to taste, and stuff the turkey. Put the mixture in 
loosely so it will absorb the gravy. Wrap the turkey in a piece 
of heavy white buttered paper and roast in a hot oven. Baste 
it often with melted butter. About ten minutes before remov- 
ing the bird from the oven take off the paper, sprinkle with 
flour and salt, and baste with butter to brown it. When cooked, 
place it on a hot dish. Prepare some brown sauce with the 
liquid in the dripping pan. Pour some around the turkey and 
serve the rest in a separate dish. 

Scalloped Turkey 

Remove all the meat from a cooked turkey, and chop it very 
fine. Break up the frame and bones, and add the fat, skin, etc., 
and cover with cold water. Cook down slowly. Butter the 
inside of a deep baking dish, put in a layer of fine bread 
crumbs, then a layer of turkey, then some bits of butter and 
bits of the turkey dressing, if you have any, then another layer 
of bread crumbs, and so on until all is used. When you think 
the bones have boiled enough, strain, and thicken with browned 
flour and season to taste. Pour some into the dish. Then 
thickly spread fine bread crumbs moistened to a thick paste 
with the gravy over the entire dish. Cover with another dish, 
and bake for thirty minutes. Remove the extra dish, and when 
the top is a nice brown, serve. 

Devilled Turkey Legs 

Score and trim cooked turkey legs. Season them with salt 
and pepper. Rub them with some mustard and oil mixed to a 
paste. Broil over a clear fire. Turn often. When a nice 
brown, serve with a rich brown gravy poured over them. 

Virginia Boned Turkey

Broiled Turkey Giblets 

Clean and wash two turkey livers and cut them in medium- 
sized squares. Open and clean the gizzards and cut the heart 
in two lengthwise. Run a thread through them and boil for 
three-quarters of an hour in enough stock to cover them. Drain, 
and cut them the same size as the liver, trimming off all the 
hard skin. Season them with salt and black pepper, finely 
chopped parsley, and moisten all with a little olive oil. Have 
ready as many squares of bacon as you have giblets. Wrap 
the giblets in the bacon. Put them on skewers one after the 
other, roll them in finely grated bread crumbs, put them on a 
gridiron, and broil over a bright fire. Turn them often. When 
nicely browned, put the skewers on a folded napkin on a dish 
and serve at once. 

Timbale of Turkey Livers with Bread Mixture 

Clean and wash eight or nine turkey livers, put them in a 
pan with one-half pound of fat pork sliced thin, a little salt 
and pepper, two or three blades of mace, small tied bunch of 
parsley, two or three finely chopped shallots, and three ounces 
of butter. Fry carefully over a hot fire until the livers are 
quite firm. Add one glass of Sherry and cook until nearly dry. 
Remove the parsley and let the livers, etc., cool. Then pound 
them in a mortar with one-third of the quantity of bread mixture 
given below. Gradually add the yolks of eight eggs, two whole 
eggs, and a ladlef ul of Espagnole sauce. Rub all through a fine 
sieve. Then add one and one-half cups of white turkey meat 
cut in small squares. Mix thoroughly and put in a well-but- 
tered round mould. Cover with a buttered paper and place in 
a saucepan with boiling water half as high as the mould. Cover 
the saucepan and boil slowly for one hour. Ten minutes before 
serving turn the mould on a dish and drain the liquid that may 
come from it. Cover with Madeira sauce and serve.

get pasty and do not stick to pan or spoon. Stir in the yolks 
of four eggs. Mix well and turn on a plate to cool. Cover 
with paper well oiled. 

Roast Goose stuffed with Chestnuts 

Select a tender goose weighing about five pounds. Singe, 
draw thoroughly, wash and dry. Stuff it with chestnuts pre- 
pared as follows : Chop one shallot very fine and put it in a 
saucepan with two scant tablespoonfuls of butter. Cook for 
two or three minutes. Then add one-quarter of a pound of 
sausage meat. Cook five minutes. Then add twelve finely 
chopped mushrooms and twelve cooked chestnuts which have 
been peeled and pounded in a mortar. Add one pinch of salt, 
one-half pinch of white pepper, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of 
powdered thyme, and a teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley. 
Let all come to a boil and add one ounce of fresh bread crumbs 
and twenty-four French chestnuts cooked, shelled, and whole. 
Mix thoroughly, being careful to keep the chestnuts whole. 
When cold, stuff the goose with this mixture. Sew both ends, 
truss, and wrap in heavy white buttered paper. Roast in mod- 
erate oven for one hour and a half. Baste with the drippings, 
dress on a hot platter. Skim the fat from the drippings, add one 
gill of white broth. Let it come to a boil. Strain into a sauce- 
boat and serve. Also serve apple sauce with the above. 

Baked Wild Goose 

Clean and prepare the goose as for roasting and soak it in 
salted water for five or six hours. Cut an onion in pieces, not 
too small, and put in the inside of the goose. Sew it up and 



200 MBS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

place in pan of boiling water. Let it boil twenty minutes. 
Take it out, remove the onion, and stuff it with the following 
forcemeat : One cup and a half of mashed potatoes, a small 
head of celery chopped fine, four hard-boiled eggs, and half a 
pound of salt pork also chopped very fine. One small grated 
turnip, a little chopped onion, a tablespoonful of salt, one of 
vinegar, and a little pepper. Moisten the mixture slightly and 
stir together thoroughly. Sew up the opening, truss the goose, 
and place it in a pan with a teacupful of stock. Brush it over 
with melted butter, cover with greased paper, and bake in 
moderate oven. When cooked, place it on platter and pour a 
little mushroom sauce or celery sauce around it. 

Roast Canvasback Duck 

Select a fat canvasback duck. Singe, clean, and wipe 
thoroughly. Rub inside lightly with a little salt. Press in the 
head from the end to the back. Truss it securely. Sprinkle 
with a little salt and roast in a brisk oven for eighteen minutes. 
Pour in the bird about two tablespoonfuls of white broth. 
Serve on a very hot dish with sliced fried hominy as a garnish. 
Serve currant jelly in a separate dish. The quicker the cook- 
ing the finer the flavor. Ducks should not be overcooked. 

Prepare redhead ducks and mallard the same way. 

Steamed Duck with Turnip 

Singe, wash, and dry two medium-sized tender ducks. Place 
in a pan with a little butter and roast in a hot oven for fifteen 
minutes or until brown. Leave them whole and put in casse- 
role or stewpan. Cut white turnip in strips one-half inch 
square and two inches long, measure three pints. Scald them 
with boiling water. Drain and spread them over the ducks, 
then season to taste with salt and white pepper. Pour in two 
cups of bouillon, cover securely, and steam in slow oven for two 



POULTRY AND GAME 201 

hours. Remove the duck to a platter. Skim off the grease 
and pour broth over the duck. Garnish with the turnip. 

Salmi of Duck 

Use two medium -sized cold roast ducks, one can of mush- 
rooms, sixteen stoned olives, one pint of Spanish sauce, one- 
half pint of clear stock, one gill of Sherr}^, one tablespoonful of 
lemon juice, one teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne, and twelve 
pieces of fried bread cut in triangles. Cut the duck into 
medium-sized pieces and place in a saucepan with the salt 
and pepper. Cover with the stock and let it come to the 
boiling-point. Then add the olives and mushrooms and boil 
for five minutes. Now add the Spanish sauce and cook until 
it comes to a boil. Then add the Sherry and lemon juice. 
Cook a minute or two. Arrange the duck in a mound on 
the dish. Surround it with a border of fried bread. Pour 
the sauce over the duck and serve very hot. This is enough 
for twelve people. 

Fillets of Ducklings 

Draw and singe some fat ducklings. Separate the breasts 
from the legs and backs by running the knife just above the 
thighs and cutting through the upper part of the back under 
the wings. Roast the backs and use them for making the 
bigarade sauce. Place the breasts in a deep earthen dish, 
season with coarse white pepper, salt, chopped parsley, bay leaf, 
thyme, the juice of one lemon, and three tablespoonfuls of salad 
oil. Let them soak for two or three hours. About three- 
quarters of an hour before dinner arrange the fillets on a skewer 
and place the seasoning over them. Cover with a big sheet of 
greased paper and cook in an oven for about twenty minutes. 
At the end of that time remove the paper and seasoning and 
brown them. Remove the fillets, trim them, and scoi'e them. 
Then put them in a saucepan with some of the sauce and allow

them barely to simmer until warmed through. Dish them in a 
close circle with a fried crouton of bread between each fillet. 
Pour the bigarade sauce over the entree and serve. 

Roast Quail 

After the desired number of quail have been cleaned, cut 
off the heads and feet, arrange the joints, and wrap each bird in 
a piece of larding pork. Place them in a saucepan just large 
enough to accommodate them. They must be packed tightly 
side by side. Cover them with boiling water. Sprinkle in 
some salt and white pepper. Place them over a hot fire for 
five or ten minutes. Remove the pork and dry each bird with 
a cloth. Rub them thoroughly with butter and roast them 
until a nice brown in a very hot oven. Baste two or three 
times with a little melted butter. Take the liquor in which 
they were boiled, strain it, and mix with an equal quantity of 
melted currant jelly. Serve in separate dish. Also serve cold 
currant jelly. Serve the birds when they are very hot. 

Quail a la Royale 

Bone eight quail, stuff them with chicken liver forcemeat, 
and truss them in the usual way. Place them in a stewpan 
with a few slices of carrot, an onion with two cloves stuck in it, 
and a bouquet. Add one pint of white broth, cover with a 
buttered paper, put the lid on, and let them cook slowly at the 
side of range for about three-quarters of an hour. Leave them 
in their liquor until they are partially cooled. Then remove 
them and set away to become cold. When cold remove the 
strings and roll each bird in bread crumbs, then in beaten egg^ 
and then again in bread crumbs. A short time before serving 
place them in a frying basket and plunge in hot lard. Fry 
until a delicate brown. Serve on hot platter. Pour Allemande

trussed for boiling. Place them in a stewpan with half a pound 
of bacon streaked fat and lean, a bouquet in the centre. Cover 
with thin layers of fat bacon and moisten with good stock 
seasoned with Sherry wine. Let them stew gently for three- 
quarters of an hour. Prepare one pint of stewed peas, mix 
them with a little of the quail stock reduced to a glaze. Arrange 
the quail in a circle with their breasts placed outwards and a 
thin slice of bacon between each one. Fill the centre with the 
stewed peas. Mix a little of the quail stock with Espagnole 
sauce, pour it around and over the quail, and serve. 

Pigeon Pie 
Arrange thin slices of sirloin beef in the bottom of a deep, 
flat-edged earthen baking dish. Season with salt and pepper, 
some herbs, chopped fine, and one ladle of Espagnole sauce. 
Split in two pieces, four or more squabs, trim and flatten them, 
season, and arrange over the beef with more fine herbs, six 
sliced hard-boiled eggs, and one ladleful of Espagnole sauce. 
Wet the edge of the dish, lay an inch wide flat rim of puff 
paste on it, wet again, and cover the whole with a large thin 
piece of paste, and trim and press the edges. Brush the surface 
with egg, make a few incisions, and cut a hole in the centre. 
Bake in a moderate oven for one hour, pour a little Espagnole 
sauce through the hole, and serve hot.

Partridges a la Malaga 



Clean and truss four or six partridges as for boiling, and 
fry them in four ounces of fresh butter until they are a light 
brown. Remove and set aside on a plate. Have at hand one 
pound of ham that has been soaked and parboiled and cut it in 
small pieces about the size of an olive. Have also ready twenty- 
four small pieces of the red part of a carrot cut with a small 
scoop and also as many very small onions. Fry the ham and 
vegetables until they are a light brown. Remove them and 
mix with the partridge in another stewpan. Add a bouquet, a 
little salt, a dash of cayenne pepper, two good glasses of Madeira 
or Sherry wine, and one tablespoonful of thin tomato sauce. 
Cover and set the stewpan where the contents will simmer 
slowly for three-quarters of an hour. The liquid should be 
reduced about one-half. When the partridges are cooked, dish 
them in a triangular form. Skim the grease from the liquid and 
vegetables, add a tablespoon of Espagnole sauce, and the juice 
of half a lemon. Boil all together for two minutes. Place the 
ham, carrots, and onions in separate groups around the partridges. 
Strain the sauce through a wet cloth. Pour it over the par- 
tridges and serve. The centre of dish may be filled with boiled 
peas. 

Fillets of Partridge a la Jardiniere 

Fillet three partridges and separate the under fillets from 
the larger ones. Season with salt and pepper. Then dip them 
in a mixture consisting of one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, 
one tablespoonful of lemon juice, and half a cup of melted but- 
ter. Let the butter cool on them, dip them in two well-beaten 
eggs, then in fine bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat. The large 
fillets ought to cook in six minutes, and the small ones in four 
minutes. Drain them on brown paper. Arrange vegetables a la 
Jardiniere in the centre of a large dish. Rest the fillets against 
them, and pour Bechamel sauce around the base. Serve very hot.

Fillet of Grouse 

Fillet of grouse may be prepared the same way as fillet of 
partridge. All the small birds may be filleted in the same 
way, but the time of cooking is only two-thirds as long as for 
the large ones. 

Prairie Chicken Fricassee 

Follow the directions for chicken fricassee or for creamed 
chicken. A sauce may be made to stir in the fricassee by tak- 
ing a little of the liquor in which the chicken is boiled, cooking 
in it minced or sliced mushrooms, adding a bit of butter, salt, 
and pepper, and stirring in fine before serving. 

Prairie Chicken Roasted 

After preparing the bird for cooking, truss it, and bind it 
with thin slices of fat salt pork. Baste it often while baking 
in a quick oven. The flesh will be dry if it is not well basted. 
The basting liquid should be of water in the bottom of the pan, 
a lump of butter, pepper and salt, the juice of half a lemon. 
When serving remove the pork, tie paper frills upon the leg 
bones, lay the chicken in a bed of parsley, and let it be well wet 
with the liquid in which it is cooked. 

Roast Snipe or "Woodcock 

Draw each bird neatly and fill in with a piece of bread and 
butter, well seasoned with pepper and salt. Round each bird 
fold a thin piece of pickled pork, fastening the blanket with the 
bill of the bird. Place them in a row in a porcelain dripping 
pan, and nearly cover with port wine. Cook half an hour, bast- 
ing frequently. Add a little butter if it is necessary in making 
the gravy in the pan, and serve the birds hot between two strix)s 
of bread toasted a light brown and buttered.

Roast Saddle of Venison with Sauce 

Trim and lard very finely a saddle of venison weighing about 
six pounds. Tie it around three or four times. Put it in a pan, 
and sprinkle one tablespoonful of salt over it, and spread one 
ounce of butter over. Roast in brisk oven for forty -five min- 
utes. Baste it often. Remove the string before placing it on 
a dish. Mix one-half glass of Sherry with one gill of white 
broth. Pour into the drippings and let all come to a boil. 
Skim off the fat and strain over the venison. Serve with the 
following sauce in a separate dish : — 

One wine-glass of Sherry. Let it come to a boil. Then 
add one-half pint of currant jelly. Stir until thoroughly dis- 
solved, then add one gill of Espagnole sauce. Stir until it 
comes to a boil and serve very hot. 

Roast Belgian Hare 

After the hare is thoroughly dressed, let it soak for a couple 
of hours in a good brine. By this process you loosen the film 
and stringy skin that covers the flesh of the rabbit family. At 
the end of the two hours wipe the flesh dry and lard it with 
narrow strips of bacon, drawing the fat through the flesh of the 
hare in spaces of an inch apart. In your dripping pan — a por- 
celain-lined one is best, since you use an acid — put two table- 
spoons of butter, a little chopped bacon, and the hare slightly 
dredged with flour. As the flesh takes on a brown, pour over

How to make Glaze 
Boil one quart of rich consomme until it becomes a thick, 
gluelike substance. You should have about half a pint. A 
demiglaze is made with one quart of consomme, boiled down to 
one pint. The glaze gives a smooth, shiny surface to cooked 
meats. When used, it should be melted over a pan of boiling 
water and applied with a brush. 

Demiglaze Sauce 
One glassful — small — of mushroom liquor, one pint Espa- 
gnole sauce, one small glassful Madeira wine, one bouquet, one 
scant teaspoonful pepper. Remove the fat carefully and cook 
for thirty minutes. Strain and use when needed.

made as follows : Mix one egg well beaten, one tablespoon of 
vinegar, two tablespoons of sour cream, butter the size of a 
walnut, and half a tablespoon of mustard, one tablespoon of 
sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir thoroughly and pour 
over the cabbage, mixing it in well.

SALADS, SAUCES, AND ASPICS 225 

Cold Slaw 

Shave or chop the cabbage (not too fine), and make the 
dressing as follows : Two eggs, a scant one- third of a cup of 
vinegar, one heaping teaspoon of salt, one heaping teaspoon 
of sugar, a little cayenne pepper. Stir all well together, add- 
ing the vinegar slowly and stirring all the time. Set the 
saucepan into another of hot water to thicken the dressing. 
Boil the water very slowly under it and stir constantly to pre- 
vent lumps. During the thickening raise the saucepan that 
contains the mixture from the water occasionally and stir and 
set it back. When the dressing is quite thick and smooth 
remove, and add a teaspoon of butter and cream. If wished, 
add a dessert or tablespoonful of olive oil. 

Cheese Salad 

To one cup of minced chicken add half a pound of soft 
tender American cheese and half a cup of pickled cauliflower 
chopped coarsely together. Rub soft the yolks of two hard- 
boiled eggs, add one teaspoon of French mustard, three table- 
spoons of vinegar, four tablespoons of oil or melted butter, and 
cayenne and salt to taste. Pour this sauce over the salad 
and garnish with the white of the egg cut in rings and 
branches of pickled cauliflower. 

Cream Cheese Salad 

Color the cream cheese a delicate green, using either the 
juice of boiled spinach or vegetable coloring, and form it in 
balls or eggs the size of a walnut. Take a flat salad dish 
and make nests of the tender leaves of lettuce, and in each 
nest put three or four eggs of the cheese. With these serve 
mayonnaise dressing and crisp salted biscuits or water 
crackers.

Chicken Salad 
Remove the meat from a chicken that has been boiled in 
salted water, and cut into pieces about one inch square. Wash 
and scrape some nice celery. Soak in cold water to make it 
crisp. Dry thoroughly and cut in pieces about the same size as 
the chicken. Have about three-quarters as much celery as you 
have chicken. Mix both together and make very moist and rich 
with a mayonnaise dressing. Arrange on dish, shape nicely, and 
cover with more dressing. Garnish and trim with white celery 
leaves, hard-boiled egg, and a few capers sprinkled over the top. 

Halibut Salad with Cucumber Spirals 
Halibut salad is an appetizing, warm weather dish for lunch- 
eon or Sunday night's supper. Steam a slice of halibut three 
inches thick. Its flavor is improved if a soup bunch is thrown 
into the steamer with it. It is done when tender enough to 
remove the skin and bone, which should be accomplished while 
it is still hot without disturbing the shape. Pour over it a 
French dressing made of four tablespoonfuls of olive oil, two 
of vinegar, with salt and pepper to taste. When cold arrange 
on a bed of lettuce hearts and fill the cavity from which the 
bone was taken with the best of them. 

This dish is prettily garnished with curls, spirals, or cups of 
cucumber, made as follows : Cut a cucumber crosswise in sec- 
tions three-quarters of an inch thick. Cut each section round 
and round in one long, thin paring. Mayonnaise dressing fills 
these cups, or is served with the fish in a separate sauce cup 
if the cucumbers are served in the usual way, that is, sliced 
with a French dressing. 

Lobster Salad 
Cut the meat of the lobster in pieces about one inch square. 
Place them in an earthen bowl and season with a French dress- 
ing of olive oil, vinegar, and a little salt and white pepper. 



SALADS, SAUCES, AND ASPICS 227 

Wash and thorouglily dry the white leaves of lettuce. Arrange 
on a flat dish in the form of shells. Drain the lobster and mix 
with enough mayonnaise dressing to make it rich and creamy. 
Fill each shell with it and pour a little mayonnaise on top of 
each one. Garnish the dish with lettuce leaves. 

Cold Meat and Potato Salad 
Cut one pound of cold meat into inch squares and mix with 
one pint of chopped, cold boiled potatoes. Put a layer in the 
bottom of a salad bowl, sprinkle with a little parsley, celery, 
and onion chopped very fine, and moisten with a salad dressing 
of oil, vinegar, salt, and white pepper. Then spread another 
layer of meat and potato, and so on till all is used. This dish 
should stand for two or three hours before serving. 

Oyster Salad 
Scald oysters until they are plump, and then put them in 
cold water while they are boiling hot, so as to make them firm. 
Put them to one side and boil five eggs hard. Take off the 
whites and chop very fine. Lay a bed of white lettuce in a 
long dish. Place the oysters in this. Cover the oysters with 
a mayonnaise dressing. Over them place the yolks of the 
eggs, which have been mashed very fine, and lastly the chopped 
whites of the eggs. Do not let it stand very long before serv- 
ing. If you do, the oysters and mayonnaise will become watery. 
Be sure the lettuce is thoroughly dried. 

Pineapple Salad 
Select a large, ripe pineapple, and after cutting off tlie top, 
remove the inside, leaving only the shell. Next remove the 
skin and seeds from a few grapes, then take two ripe bananas, 
skin them, and cut into small pieces. Also cut the pineapple 
and grapes in small pieces. Mix all with mayonnaise dressing, 
replace in the pine shell, and serve.

Russian Salad 

Cut in thin slices some cold salmon, chicken, and partridge. 
Arrange them in a dish and mix with them in small quantities 
some cooked turnips, carrots, cauliflower, and asparagus tops, 
— each vegetable cut in small pieces, — a few capers, shrimps, 
and a small portion of caviare. Make a dressing of mustard, 
oil, vinegar, a dash of cayenne, and one tablespoonful of 
minced shallots. Pour the mixture over the contents of salad 
dish and set on ice until served. This salad should be made 
so that each and every article can be tasted, but none should 
be pronounced. 

Aspic Jelly 

Soak one box of gelatine in half a pint of consomme for two 
hours. At the end of that time put one pint and a half over 
the fire. As soon as it reaches the boiling-point add, with the 
liquid gelatine, a gill of Madeira or Sherry wine, two table- 
spoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of lemon 
juice, and one teaspoonful of salto Place the pan on a cool part 
of the range where it will cook slowly. Stir constantly for five 
minutes. Strain through a flannel bag or cloth. The jelly 
should be as clear as crystal. 

Aspic of Chicken * 

Use half the rule for aspic jelly, one pint and a half of tender, 
cooked chicken free from skin, fat, and bones, and cut into dice, 
three slices of the red part of a cooked carrot, and three slices 
of cooked beet, the white of one hard-boiled egg^ one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and one-third of a teaspoonful of white pepper. 
Prepare the mould as for foie gras, but decorate it with beet, 
carrot, and the white of egg. When the layer of jelly which 
completely covers the vegetables is hard, season the chicken 
with salt and pepper and arrange it on the top, being careful 



SALADS, SAUCES, AND ASPICS 229 

to leave a space of about one-third of an inch between the 
chicken and the mould. With a spoon sprinkle a gill of the 
liquid jelly over the meato Let it stand about half an hour to 
harden. At the end of that time pour the remainder of the 
jelly into the space between the chicken and the mould. Let 
it stand several hours. At serving time turn on a flat dish. 
If a border mould, fill in centre with celery salad, — may- 
onnaise and small pieces of celery. Be careful not to drop 
anything on the aspic. Garnish the border with sprays of 
white celery. 

Aspic de Foie Gras 

A small round or oval border mould is preferred, although 
any shape will do. Have at hand one of the smallest jars of 
foie gras, half the rule of aspic jelly, one truffle, and the white 
of one hard-boiled egg. Place the mould in a pan and surround 
it with cracked ice and a little water. Pour the liquid jelly 
into the mould to the depth of half an inch. Let this stand 
until it hardens. Then decorate it with the white of an egg 
and the truffle, which has been cut in thin slices and stamped 
with a fancy vegetable cutter. Moisten them with a little 
liquid jelly and let them stand about ten minutes so that the 
jelly may harden and hold them in place. Next, gently pour 
in another layer of jelly about one-quarter of an inch thick. 
Let this harden. Scrape all the fat from the foie gras. Dip 
it for half a minute in hot water. Wipe it dry and cut in thin 
sliceJi, then in pieces about one inch square. Spread a layer of 
these over the congealed jelly. Cover with the liquid jelly and 
wait until it hardens before adding the second layer of foie 
gras. Continue until the mould is almost filled. Finish with 
a thin layer of liquid jelly. Set in cool place for three or four 
hours. Serve on a flat dish. If a border mould has been used, 
fill in the centre with Tartare sauce garnished with stuffed 
olives.

Aspic of Trout 
Clean, wash, and dry a good-sized fresh trout. Fill the cavity 
with veal forcemeat for fish and truss the head. Place it in a 
saucepan, cover it with broth, and boil it until it is done. Have 
ready a long piece of fried bread as long as the fish, cover the 
bread with paper, and when the trout is cold, drained, and 
thoroughly dry, place it on the top with the butter beneath it. 
Glaze with a half set aspic jelly, decorate the edge with jelly 
croutons. Garnish the base with halves of hard-boiled eggs 
and small heads of lettuce cut in half, and serve with a mayon- 
naise dressing. 

Calf's-foot Jelly 

Bone and soak four calf's feet in cold water for one hour. 
Wash well, parboil, and then boil with four quarts of water 
until soft. Skim off all the fat, pass the liquid through a wet 
cloth. Put some in a saucer and set on ice to cool so as to test 
it. If too hard, add water ; if too soft, boil a little longer. 
Put three pints of the liquid in an earthen saucepan with four 
cloves, a little ginger and cinnamon, the juice of two lemons, 
twelve ounces of granulated sugar, and a gill of Madeira wine. 
Beat two eggs with a little water, mix into the preparation, 
and stir over the fire until it comes to a boil. Strain twice 
through a jelly bag. Pour into eight or more crystal jelly 
glasses. Cool thoroughly, serve one to each person. 

Chicken Jelly served with Any Salad 

Take one fowl chopped in small pieces, — use feet, head, 
and all the bones, — one quart of cold water, one bay leaf, and 
season well with salt and white pepper. Put over fire and let 
come to a boil. Then push the kettle back on the range 
where the mixture will simmer slowly for five hours. Strain 
and set away to cool. After removing all the fat, replace it on 
the stove and add the white of one well-beaten egg to clear it. 



SALADS, SAUCES, AND ASPICS 231 

Be sure the whole is well seasoned. Then pour in a fancy 
shaped mould. When it begins to set, stand a cup or glass in 
centre, and when the jelly is cold carefully remove the cup. 
Fill the gap left by the cup with cream and Philadelphia cream 
cheese whipped together. Cover this with a little of the jelly. 
To serve turn the jelly on a dish. Garnish with small sand- 
wiches of Graham bread. Instead of cheese and cream, one 
may use pate de foie gras or any filling desired.

Boiled Artichokes 

Wash the artichokes well in several waters and soak them 
for a few hours in salted water to remove any insects which 
may be in the leaves. Trim away the leaves at the bottom. 
Cut off the stems. Place them in boiling salted water and 
boil until tender. Leave the saucepan uncovered while they 
are boiling. To two quarts of water add one tablespoonful of 
salt and a pinch of washing soda about the size of a pea. The 
last-named ingredient tends to keep them green. They are 
sufficiently cooked when the leaves can easily be removed. 
Drain them and serve with a little white sauce poured over 
them. Serve melted butter in a separate dish. This vegeta- 
ble will cook in less than half an hour. 

Artichokes a la Lyonnaise 

Pull off the leaves without damaging the bottoms of the 
artichokes, which must be turned smooth with a knife. Cut 
the artichokes into quarters, and, after removing the fibrous 
parts, parboil them in salted water for about five minutes. 
Then drain in a colander and plunge them in cold water. 
Drain them on a cloth and arrange them in a circle in a sauce- 
pan which is thickly spread with four ounces of butter. Sift a 
dessertspoonful of powdered sugar over them. Season with 
salt and coarse white pepper and moisten with one glass of 
white wine and a tablespoonful of rich consomme. Place them 
on a slow fire and let them simmer gently for three-quarters of

an hour, taking care they do not burn. When cooked they 
should be a nice yellow color and nicely glazed. Dish them in 
the shape of a dome, showing the bottom of the artichokes 
only. Remove any leaves that may have broken off in the 
saucepan. Add a small cup of Espagnole sauce, two medium- 
sized pieces of butter, and a little lemon juice. Let this simmer 
over the stove and stir constantly with a spoon. When the 
butter has been thoroughly mixed with the sauce, pour it over 
the artichokes and serve. 

Artichokes a I'ltalienne 

These are prepared the same as above, except brown Ital- 
ienne sauce must be substituted for Espagnole sauce. 

Artichokes with Butter Sauce 

Trim the bottom of six artichokes, cut off the tips of the 
leaves, and boil them in salted water for three-quarters of an 
hour. When done, drain them on a sieve and then soak them 
for five minutes in cold water. Remove the fibrous portion 
from the inside with the handle of a tablespoon and put them 
back in some hot water for a few minutes. When warmed 
through, drain them upside down, putting them on a cloth to 
absorb the moisture. Pour a little butter sauce inside each 
one, and serve with some of the sauce in a separate dish. 
Melted butter with a little lemon juice mixed with it may be 
used in place of the sauce. 

Butter Sauce 

Mix one heaping teaspoonful of flour and one gill of cold 
water, add a little salt, two peppercorns, a dash of grated 
nutmeg, a clove, and half an ounce of butter. Stir over the 
fire until it comes to a boil. Let it cook slowly for fifteen 
minutes. Remove from the fire and gradually add one-half 
pound of fresh butter and the juice of one lemon. If the sauce 



234 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

should become too thick, add a little more water. Strain 
through a wet cloth. 

Baked Asparagus 

Scrape, wash, and bunch as much white asparagus as 
required. Boil until rather firm, then drain on a cloth with- 
out cooling. Have the following sauce prepared : Mix a scant 
pint of thick Bechamel sauce with three egg yolks and three 
ounces of grated Parmesan cheese. Stir over the fire until it 
comes to a boil. In an oval buttered baking dish range a 
layer of asparagus, — all the heads one w^ay, — cover the eating 
part only with some of the sauce and a little grated cheese. 
Add another layer of asparagus, etc., until the whole is used. 
Finish with the sauce, grated cheese, and a few fresh bread 
crumbs. Put small pieces of butter on top. Do not have any 
of this mixture on the stalks. Cover the stalks with a curved 
tin sheet so that only the mashed part will be exposed to the 
heat, and bake to a nice brown. Take off the tin sheet and 
serve. 

Baked Asparagus 

Cut the stalks into inch lengths and boil them slowly in 
salted water. When tender, drain and arrange in a baking 
dish, pouring over a rich, drawn butter sauce or sauce Hollan- 
daise. Grate a good cheese — Parmesan is the best — over the 
top and brown. 

Baked Asparagus 

First cook the asparagus in water till tender, and then put 
it in a baking dish with about one tablespoonful of the grated 
Parmesan scattered between each layer. Melt one tablespoon- 
ful of butter in the frying pan, and when it is quite hot fry 
two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion till brown. Pour this 
over the asparagus, add another sprinkling of the cheese, and 
last of all some fine bread crumbs. Brown delicately in a hot 
oven.

Pried Asparagus 

Fried asparagus is made just exactly as well from the canned 
variety of the vegetable as from the fresh. Drain the asparagus 
on a cloth, season it with white pepper and with salt. Dust it 
lightly with flour, then dip in beaten egg^ and roll in sifted 
bread crumbs. Fry it in hot fat. The best plan is to use 
half butter and half lard, the whole being strictly limited in 
quantity. Serve on a hot dish. 

Asparagus Canapes 

Scrape lightly the stalks, boil until the stalks are tender, 
when half done add a little salt. When done prepare each 
bunch to serve on separate plates. Take a slice of toast, dip 
quickly in the asparagus water. Lay this on the plate, sprinkle 
a very little salt over it, also pour a small quantity of melted 
butter. Lay the asparagus on this. Remove the string from 
the bunches. Sprinkle a little more salt over it and over this 
pour melted butter. 

Brussels Sprouts in Cream 

Take off any loose leaves hanging from the sprouts, put 
them in cold water, and let them stand half an hour so that 
if any insects are in them they will come out. Then put them 
on to boil, using one quart of sprouts to two quarts of boiling 
water. They will probably be done in twenty minutes or half 
an hour. Have them well cooked, but not softened to lose 
their shape. Toward the end of the boiling add a tablespoon- 
ful of salt. Drain off the water, add a dash of pepper, and 
a small cup of cream in which a teaspoon of flour or corn-starch 
has been stirred. Let the sprouts simmer five or ten minutes 
in the cream and serve.

Baked Bananas 

Fill a baking dish with bananas which have been peeled, cut 
in halves, lengthwise, and crosswise. To one banana allow two 
tablespoonfuls of water, one of sugar, one teaspoonful of melted 
butter, one of lemon juice, and a few grains of salt. Baste 
often and cook slowly a half an hour or till the bananas are 
red and syrup thick. Serve very hot. 

Banana Fritters 

Beat three eggs, one pint of milk, and flour enough to make 
stiff batter, add one teaspoonful of baking powder. Peel the 
bananas. Cut them in four pieces. Dip each one separately 
in the batter and drop in boiling fat. Fry three or four 
minutes, drain on paper, and serve with wine sauce. Sprinkle 
with powdered sugar before serving. 

Stuffed Cabbage 

Select two medium-sized solid cabbages. Remove the loose 
leaves, wash carefully, and soak them in salted water for one 
hour. Then parboil for fifteen minutes. Cool in fresh water, 
press the water out, and set them on a cloth to drain. Make 
a forcemeat with one-half pound of raw, lean veal and one-half 
pound of fat pork. Chop fine, pound well, and rub through 
puree sieve. Season with salt and white pepper, grated nut- 
meg, and chopped parsley, add the yolks of four eggs, and 
mix well. Slit the cabbages, cut out the cores, and fill with 
the forcemeat. Place them together and wrap them in thin 
slices of fat pork. Tie them with strings. Put them in a 
saucepan with a quart of broth and one glass of Sherry wine. 
Cover and cook slowly for two hours and till the liquid is 
reduced to a glaze. Dish up the cabbage, untie the strings, 
remove pieces of pork, and drain. Take off the fat from the 
glaze, add two ladlefuls of brown sauce to the saucepan to 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 237 

dilute it. Pour the sauce over the well-drained cabbages 
and serve hot. 

Mushrooms make a delicious stuffing for the cabbage when 
they are boiled, chopped, seasoned with salt and pepper, fried, 
and finally mixed with half their quantity of boiled rice and 
eggs, allowing two eggs to a head of cabbage. 

Colonial Dutch Sour Cabbage 

Carefully shave or chop the head of a white cabbage and 
put it in a saucepan with a little hot water. Cover closely 
and let it cook slowly on the back of the range in its steam and 
juice for four or five hours. A little before time to serve, 
add salt to taste, a small tablespoonful will commonly do, a 
large cup of thick sour cream, a dash of pepper, and let all 
boil up so that the cream will cook into the cabbage. 

At last, just before serving, add a tablespoonful of vinegar 
or more if the vinegar is weak, stir it in thoroughly, and serve. 

During the cooking the cabbage may need more water. If 
so, add boiling water and so little of it that when it is time to 
add the cream the water will be almost cooked out. If your 
cabbage head is large, you may need more than a cup of cream. 
The cream should be enough to whiten and oil all the cabbage. 
If sweet cream is used, you may need more vinegar. Sour 
cream is best when obtainable. 

Carrots a TAllemande 

Prepare two bunches of spring carrots, keeping their origi- 
nal shape, but making them all equal in size. Parboil them in 
salted water for about ten minutes. Drain them in a colander 
and plunge them in cold water. Drain them again and lay 
them on a napkin. Then place them in a deep saucepan with 
two ounces of fresh butter, two ounces of loaf sugar, and about 
one pint of good consomme. Put the lid on and let them boil 



238 Mrs. seely's cook book 

very gently over a slow fire for half an hour. Then set them 
to boil briskly until their liquor is reduced to a glaze. Serve 
in a round-bottomed dish, building them up in a perfect dome. 
Garnish with Allemande sauce mixed with a little finely chopped 
parsley. Pour the remainder of the glaze over the carrots and 
serve very hot. 

Carrots with Cream Sauce 

Peel and cut enough new carrots in one-sixth of an inch 
slices. Put them in a saucepan with one-half pint of water, 
a little salt, tablespoonful sugar, and one ounce of butter. 
Cover and cook about one-half hour, tossing occasionally. 
Add a liaison of three egg yolks, — the liaison including twice 
as much cold water as you have liquid yolks when beaten, — 
and one-half cup cream, one ounce of butter, and chopped 
parsley. Mix carefully by tossing in the saucepan. Serve 
at once. 

Baked Cauliflower 

Pare off the green leaves and boil two heads of cauliflower 
in salted water and a small piece of butter. Drain, season 
inside and out with salt, pepper, and a little grated nutmeg. 
Put in dome form on a buttered baking dish. Mix one scant 
pint of thick Bechamel sauce with four egg yolks and four 
ounces of American or Parmesan cheese, grated. Let all boil 
a minute, cover the cauliflower with it, and smooth with the 
blade of a knife. Then sprinkle with fine bread crumbs, more 
grated cheese, and a few bits of butter. Bake to a nice color 
twenty minutes. 

Boiled Cauliflower 

Select a medium-sized cauliflower. Trim neatly and soak 
it in salt and water for two hours. Then examine it thoroughly 
and wash it in fresh water. Place it in a saucepan with a 
small handful of salt, white pepper, and enough water to cover 



VEGETABLES AND FAUINACEOVS FOODS 2B9 

it. Boil until tender for one-luilf hour or more. Drain in a 
colander, place on a dish, and cover with a rich white sauce 
or a HoUandaise sauce. 

Cauliflower with Parmesan Cheese 

Remove the green stalks and if large divide into quarters 
one or more fresh cauliflowers. Wash and soak in salted water 
for one hour. Then place in hot water with a lump of butter, 
a little salt, and coarse white pepper. When cooked tender, 
drain on a sieve. Arrange cauliflower, flowerets down, in a 
deep dish, in a few minutes invert on the dish it is to be served 
on and entirely cover it with the following sauce : Mix one 
cup of veloute sauce with four ounces of Parmesan cheese, 
with beaten yolks of four eggs, a good-sized lump of butter, 
a little lemon juice, salt and white pepper to taste. Stir this 
over the fire until it is well mixed. Do not let it boil. After 
making the cauliflower with this sauce, smooth the top, and 
cover it with a coating of Parmesan cheese. Place in the 
oven for fifteen minutes until it is a nice brown. Garnish 
with fried bread cut in fancy shapes. The bread may be ar- 
ranged in the shape of a cornucopia and the cauliflower placed 
in it before it is masked. Then there is no danger of the cauli- 
flower spreading. 

Fried Cauliflower 

Parboil two cauliflowers in salted w^ater. Drain and break 
them in small bunches. Make a batter of two tablespoons 
of olive oil, six ounces of flour, salt and white pepper, three 
eggs, and one glass of milk. Beat with an egg-beater until 
very smooth. Dip each piece of cauliflower in this batter and 
then drop one by one in deep hot fat. Fry until crisp and 
light brown. Drain on brown paper and serve on a folded 
napkin.

Celery a la Villeroi 

Clean six heads of celery and cut them in pieces about six 
inches long. Parboil them in water for ten minutes and then 
immerse them in cold water. Drain them on a sieve and after- 
ward place them on a saucepan with enough white broth to 
cover them. Let them cook over a slow fire for one hour. 
When done, drain on a cloth to free them from all the mois- 
ture. Cover them with some reduced Allemande sauce and set 
away until cold. Roll them in fine bread crumbs, then dip 
in beaten egg^ then in bread crumbs again. Arrange in wire 
basket and fry in hot lard until they become a light brown. 
Drain on heavy brown paper and serve very hot. 

Celery a la Creme 
Wash and cut the celery in small pieces. Put them in a 
saucepan and cook gently till tender in a broth of chicken or 
veal. Water may be used instead of the broth. Add cream 
in the proportion of a cup of cream to two cups of the chopped 
celery. Season with salt and pepper and let the whole boil up. 
If a thickening is wished, stir a little flour in the cream. 

Buffalo Corn Oysters 

Cut down each row of kernels on fresh sweet corn-cobs, 
running a sharp knife down the centre of each row, and then 
scrape out the pulp. Do not cut the kernels off the cob. 
To one cup of the pulp add the yolk of one egg^ a seasoning of 
butter, pepper and salt, and, just before frying, the white beaten 
stiff. Drop from a spoon into a hot frying pan, in which a little 
butter is melted, and fry a golden brown. 

Corn Fritters 
One pint of grated sweet corn, one and a half cups of milk, 
one-half cup of flour, one tablespoonful of melted butter, two 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 241 

eggs, a little salt and pepper, and one teaspoonful of baking 
powder. Mix the milk and well-beaten eggs together, add the 
melted butter and seasoning, then the flour and baking powder 
sifted together, lastly stir in the grated corn. Drop by the 
tablespoonful in hot fat. Drain on brown paper and serve 
very hot. 

Stuffed Cucumbers 

Pare off the peel and both ends of some large cucumbers 
and cut in lengths about two inches long. Remove all the 
seeds. Parboil them in salted water and drain thoroughly. 
Then fill each piece of cucumber with chicken forcemeat. 
Arrange them in a saucepan which is lined with thin slices of 
bacon, then cover them with slices of bacon. Moisten them 
with a little beef broth and cook over a slow fire for half an 
hour. When they have become quite tender, drain them on a 
cloth and serve them with Espagnole sauce. 

Stuffed Cucumbers with Sauce 

For six or eight persons peel four cucumbers of good size. 
After cutting off the ends, cut each cucumber into two parts. 
Remove the seeds with an apple corer. Put a tablespoonful of 
salt in one quart of cold water. Put the cucumbers in the 
liquid and set away in a cool place. Chop about one-quarter 
of a pound of veal in fine pieces. See that there is no gristle or 
fat. Mix one gill of milk and one-third of a gill of fine bread 
crumbs. Cook until it becomes a smooth paste. Ten minutes 
will probably be long enough. Then add the veal, one-half 
teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of pepper, an 
eighth of a teaspoonful of thyme, one-quarter of a teaspoonful 
of onion juice, one teaspoonful of butter, and one well-beaten 
egg. Remove the cucumbers from the water, dry thoroughly 
and fill with the forcemeat. Pack them solidly and be careful 
to have the ends of the cucumbers smooth. Lay them in a 
stewpan. Pour over them one pint and a half of boiling veal 



242 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

stock or chicken stock, adding one bay leaf. If the stock has 
no seasoning, add one-half teaspoonful of salt and one-fifth of a 
teaspoonful of white pepper. Cover and let them simmer for 
three-quarters of an hour. When served, place the cucumber 
on thin slices of toast. Cover with the following sauce and 
serve at once : — 

Sauce 

Rub together until smooth three tablespoonfuls of butter, 
one generous tablespoonful of flour, then add three gills of 
Avhite stock, a bit of carrot the size of a quarter of a dollar, one 
slice of onion the same size, a sprig of parsley, a clove, a bay 
leaf and a little grating of nutmeg, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a fifth of a teaspoonful of white pepper. Simmer for half an 
hour. Add one teaspoonful of lemon juice. Strain and serve. 

Fried Egg Plant 

Prepare a medium-sized egg plant two or three hours before 
cooking. Peel and cut it in even slices about one-quarter of an 
inch thick. Place them on a dish, sprinkle each slice with a 
little salt and pepper. Put them in press with a heavy weight 
on top. This will extract all the bitter taste. Dip each slice 
in beaten egg, then in fine bread crumbs. Fry in hot fat until 
a nice brown. Season with a little salt, drain on brown paper, 
and serve very hot. If one prefer, the egg plant may be dipped 
in thin batter instead of egg and crumbs, and cooked in the 
same way. 

Stuffed Egg Plant 

Take two medium-sized egg plants. Cut off the stem, slit 
lengthwise in halves, tracing the incisions inside. Fry the 
plants until soft, then drain. Then take two ounces of butter, 
two ounces of finely chopped pork, two ounces of finely chopped 
shallots, one pint of chopped mushrooms. Stir and cook ten 
minutes. With a tablespoon take up most of the fleshy part of 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 243 

the egg plant, put with the above preparation, and season 
with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. Mix thoroughly and 
put this stuffing in the egg plants on a baking dish. Sprinkle 
with fresh bread crumbs and grated cheese — Parmesan or 
American. Drop a little sweet oil over and bake light brown 
in a pretty hot oven. Slide on a dish, pour a ladleful of brown 
sauce round it, and serve. 

Boiled Hominy 
Wash one cup of white homin}^, and after draining, place in 
a double boiler. Add one teaspoonful of salt and one quart of 
boiling water. Boil moderately for one hour or until tender. 

Braised Lettuce 

Trim, wash, and scald twelve white heart cabbage lettuces. 
Drain them on a cloth, cut and spread them open, season with 
pepper and salt, tie each one up with a string, and place in 
a pan on thin layers of fat bacon. Add a carrot, a small bou- 
quet, and an onion with two cloves stuck in it. Cover with a 
buttered piece of paper and moisten with the toj^pings from 
white stock. Boil slowly by the side of the fire for fifty minutes. 
Drain them on a sieve. Then remove the strings. Press them 
neatly in a cloth and open each lettuce head with a knife. 
Turn the ends of the leaves so as to give to the lettuce a 
smooth, rounded end. Cut off the stalk and place each lettuce 
head carefully in a saucepan. Strain the liquor they were 
boiled in. Remove every particle of grease and boil down to 
the consistency of a half glaze. Add it to the lettuce and 
fifteen minutes before they are required set them in the oven to 

get warm. 

Fried Lima Beans 

Put three pints of shelled Lima beans in salted boiling 
water and cook until they are tender. Drain thoroughly and 
put in a saucepan with four ounces of melted butter, salt and 



244 3IRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

pepper to taste. Shake the pan over a brisk fire for a few 
minutes, add finely chopped parsley and a little lemon juice. 
Shake thoroughly, to mix all together, and serve. 

Macaroni a la Reine 

Take eight ounces of macaroni, break it in pieces three or 
four inches long, wash it in cold water, and at once drop it 
lightly and by degrees into a pan of boiling water. Let it boil 
until the pipes are tender, which may be in about fifteen or 
twenty minutes. When it is half done, add a tablespoon of 
salt, and shake the pan now and then to keep the macaroni 
free from the bottom. When cooked, turn it upon a sieve or 
colander to drain. Have ready ten ounces of rich, well-flavored 
white cheese, dissolved in a pint of cream. Add to the cream 
and cheese a little salt, a rather full seasoning of cayenne, and a 
couple of ounces of sweet butter. Lay the macaroni in a dish, 
pour over it the cheese sauce, strew it thickly with cubes of 
fine white bread fried a pale gold color and dried perfectly, and 
serve. As a matter of precaution, it is well to boil the cream 
before the cheese is melted in it. 

The cheese should be sliced very thin and be quite free 
from the hard part next the rind. It should be stirred in the 
cream without ceasing until thoroughly dissolved and the 
whole is perfectly smooth. 

Macaroni Croquettes 
Cook a quarter of a pound of macaroni in salted water, 
drain and put in a saucepan with two ounces of butter, one 
ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, salt and white pepper to 
taste, and a ladleful of Allemande sauce. Mix thoroughly and 
turn into a small buttered square tin pan. Cover it with a 
buttered paper, then with another pan and a light weight. 
When cold, turn it on the table, divide with a knife or oval 
pastry cutter, roll each piece in grated cheese, dip in beaten

egg, roll in fine bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat. Drain on 
heavy brown paper and serve with grated Parmesan cheese in 
a separate dish. 

Macaroni a I'ltalienne 

Break the macaroni in pieces about four inches long. Boil 
it in hot water with a small lump of butter, a little salt and 
white pepper. When done, drain it on a napkin. As soon as 
it is dry, prepare the following sauce : Place one pint of tomato 
sauce in a saucepan and add two lumps of butter. Mix the 
whole well together. Sprinkle a layer of macaroni in the 
bottom of a dish, cover with the sauce, and sprinkle with Par- 
mesan cheese. Then spread the macaroni again, and so on until 
the dish is full. Strew grated Parmesan cheese over the top, 
place in hot oven for five minutes, and serve while quite hot. 

Macaroni a la Solferino 

To half a pound of macaroni, boiled in water and well 
strained, add half an onion, a slice of raw ham chopped fine and 
browned. Moisten the mixture with tomato sauce, and just 
before serving sprinkle the whole with four or five tablespoons 
of grated cheese. 

Oyster Macaroni 

Boil the macaroni in a cloth to keep it whole and when 
thoroughly cooked, drain. Put a layer in a deep dish with salt, 
white pepper, and butter, then a layer of medium-sized oysters 
seasoned in the same way, then another layer of macaroni, and 
so on until the dish is full. Mix fine bread crumbs with one 
egg well beaten, spread over the top, and bake in moderate oven. 

Boiled Macaroni or Spaghetti 

Into a saucepan nearly full of boiling Wt^ter drop the 
macaroni gradually. When half done, add a little salt. Keep 



246 MBS. seely's cook book 

the macaroni from sinking to the bottom by moving it with a 
meat fork. When it is very tender, pour into a colander and 
drain. Put half of the macaroni into a vegetable dish. 
Sprinkle it with salt, pepper, and a little dry Coleman's mus- 
tard, and over this pour melted butter. Add grated cheese. 
Then lay on the other half of the macaroni and add the same 
seasoning. Pour on melted butter, and with a fork turn the 
macaroni over in the butter. Serve without baking. 

Stewed Mushrooms 

Take one pound of large and dry mushrooms. Peel and 
wash them, drain thoroughly, and cut them in small squares. 
Put them in an earthen bowl and pour over them one table- 
spoonful of olive oil, a scant tablespoonful of salt, and a tea- 
spoonful of white pepper. Let them soak for three hours. 
Remove them, and let them stew in their own liquor for five 
or six minutes. When tender, place them on dish and pour the 
following sauce over them : Take three tablespoonfuls of olive 
oil, one teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley, one-half teaspoon- 
f ul of finely chopped chives, and one clove of crushed garlic. 
Mix all, and stir over the fire until thoroughly heated. 

Stuffed Mushrooms 

Select twelve mushrooms as large as possible. Cut off the 
heads, pare the edges, and wash them. Clean the stalks, wash 
with the parings, and chop very fine. Squeeze out the water. 
Put two ounces of butter in a saucepan with one tablespoonful 
of chopped shallot. Fry a little, then stir in the chopped mush- 
rooms, and fry until almost dry. Sprinkle with one-half ounce 
of flour. Then mix well and moisten with a little broth, and 
season to taste with salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg, also a 
little chopped parsley. Stir and boil until quite thick. When 
this mixture is partially cool, fill the mushroom heads. Place 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 247 

tliem in a baking-disli, sprinkle each with bread crumbs and a 
small piece of butter. Bake in moderate oven about fifteen 
minutes. Place on a dish, pour Espagnole sauce round them, 
and garnish with quarters of lemon. 

Fried Mushrooms with Tomato Sauce 

Take two pounds of fresh mushrooms, peel, and wash them 
in water and a little vinegar to keep them as white as possible. 
Drain, then slice the heads in two or three pieces, and chop up 
the stalks. Have one-quarter of a pint of heated olive oil, add 
the heads and fry until a light brown, then add two table- 
spoons of chopped shallots, two bruised cloves of garlic, and the 
chopped stalks. Drain most of the oil off, add two ladlefuls of 
tomato sauce and a little melted beef extract. Season with 
salt, white pepper, and a dash of cayenne. Boil two minutes, 
shaking the saucepan all the time. Add a little lemon juice 
and chopped parsley and pour in a deep dish. 

Mushrooms a la Bindley 

Have at hand two pounds of fresh and firm mushrooms. 
Cut and trim the stalks, pare the heads, and wash them. Put 
in a saucepan with a little water, four ounces of butter and the 
juice of two lemons. Cook for five minutes over a brisk fire, 
occasionally shaking the pan. Take the upper crust of four 
French rolls, remove the inside, and fry the crust in clarified 
butter. Mix the gravy the mushrooms were cooked in with 
three pints of veloute sauce. Add four ounces of butter, the 
yolks of four eggs, and white pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly 
and rub through a wet cloth. Pour a little of this sauce in a 
dish, arrange the crusts, hollow side uppermost, on the dish, put 
the mushrooms in the sauce, heat thoroughly, then fill each 
crust, taking care to have the largest and whitest mushrooms 
on top.

Oatmeal 
Place one cup of oatmeal in a double boiler, add one tea- 
spoonful of salt, and one quart and a pint of boiling water. 
Stir occasionally while it boils over a moderate fire for half an 
hour, or until the flakes are tender. If too thick, it may be 
thinned with boiling water. 

Stewed Okra with Tomato Sauce 
Pare both ends and wash the okra. Put in a saucepan with 
salt and pepper, a ladlef ul of rich broth, and half a pint of tomato 
sauce, and one-half pint of Espagnole sauce. Cover and stew 
slowly for one-half hour. Dish carefully without breaking the 
okra. Sprinkle with parsley and serve. 

Glazed Onions 
Peel twelve medium-sized white onions and soak them for 
one hour in cold water, changing the water twice while they 
are soaking. Drain them on a sieve. Put two ounces of but- 
ter in a saucepan. Add one teaspoonful of sugar and half a 
cup of beef broth or stock. Arrange the onions in the pan so 
they do not touch. Cook over a slow fire until they become 
tender and the outside is brown. Remove the cover from the 
saucepan, put a very little beef extract on top of each onion. 
Then place the pan in the oven for five minutes. When the 
extract melts and a nice glaze forms on the top of the onions, 
they are ready to serve as a garnish or vegetable. If served as 
a vegetable, the sauce they were cooked in may be poured over 
them. 

Glazed Onions

medium size, in an hour, or perhaps an hour and a half. By 
the time they are tender the water should be pretty well cooked 
out. Pour over them as they lie in the saucepan enough cream 
to reach to their middle. Boil up, salt if necessary, dish by tak- 
ing the onions out one by one with a cooking ladle, having care 
not to break them, and pour over the hot cream and serve. 

Stuffed Onions 
Boil six large onions slowly for one hour in plenty of clear 
water. Remove from the water, and with a sharp knife cut a 
piece from the centre of each. Mix together two tablespoonfuls 
of finely chopped ham, three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 
one tablespoonful of butter, three tablespoonfuls of milk or 
cream, one egg^ one-half teaspoonful salt, and a grain of cay- 
enne. Fill with this mixture the spaces cut in the onion. 
Sprinkle each one with bread crumbs, one-half a teaspoonful of 
butter on each onion. Place on earthen plates, and bake in 
slow oven for one hour. Serve with cream sauce. Spanish 
onions are the best to use. 

Boiled Onions 
Peel off the whole thick outer skin and lay the onions one- 
half an hour in cold water. Pour hot water over them and 
boil ten minutes. Pour off this water, add fresh water and a 
teaspoon of salt, and boil until tender at the core, which will 
take one hour or one hour and a half. Turn into a colander, 
drain, with a spoon lay each onion in the vegetable dish. Sift 
salt over each one, and pour over all a small quantity of melted 
butter or hot cream, and finish with a dash of pepper. 

Pried Parsley- 
Soak parsley in ice water for two hours, so it will be crisp. 
Dry thoroughly, arrange in frying basket, plunge in boiling 
hot fat, leave for a second, remove basket from fat, shake it. 
Plunge in fat once more, drain on brown paper, and serve.

Parsnip Cakes 

Peel, cut in pieces, and cook some parsnips in salted water 
in which a tablespoonful of flour has been mixed. When ten- 
der, drain thoroughly, chop fine, and press through a fine col- 
ander. Return to the saucepan, add salt, a little white pepper, 
a little flour, and the beaten yolks of three eggs. Stir on the 
fire for five minutes and put on a plate to cool. Then turn on 
a floured table and divide in the shape and size of a small cod- 
fish ball. Dip in beaten Qgg^ then in cracker crumbs. Fry 
until light brown in very hot lard. Drain on brown paper, 
garnish with parsley, and serve hot. These are very good with 
pork chop. 

Parsnip Balls 

Parboil six large parsnips, let them get cold, then peel and 
grate them. Beat two eggs until very light and mix thor- 
oughly with the grated parsnips, adding sufficient flour to bind 
the mixture together. Flour the hands, roll the mixture into 
balls, and drop in deep boiling fat. Fry until a good brown, 
drain on brown paper. Serve very hot. 

Stewed Peas 

Put one quart of young peas in a pan with plenty of water 
and four ounces of butter. Rub the peas and butter together 
until they are well mixed. Then drain off the water and put 
the peas into a stewpan with two cabbage leaves shredded 
small, a small bunch of parsley and green onions, one dessert- 
spoonful of powdered sugar, and a little salt. Put the lid on 
and stew the peas gently over a slow fire for about half an hour. 
When done, if there seems to be much liquid, boil it down 
quickly over the fire. Knead two ounces of fresh butter with 
one dessert-spoonful of flour. Put this into the peas and toss 
the whole together over the fire until well mixed. 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 251 

Canned Peas 

Pour the peas in a colander. Rinse by pouring through 
plenty of water. Add three large iron spoons of cold water, 
salt, a little sugar, enough so they will taste like a sweet pea, 
and a lump of butter. Set the saucepan in another of hot 
water, cover, and cook half an hour. 

Peppers with Tomato Stuffing 

Immerse as many medium-sized peppers as desired in boiling 
fat for one-half a minute, rub them with a towel to remove the 
peel. Cut round the stem or core, remove it and the seeds. 
Fill with a tomato stuffing, put in a pan, baste frequently with 
olive oil, and bake in moderate oven for half an hour. Place 
on a platter, pour a tomato sauce round them, and serve. 

Tomato Stuffing 

Take two ounces of butter, two tablespoonfuls of olive oil, 
two of finely chopped onions, and a pint of chopped mushrooms. 
Stir and fry about twelve minutes, seasoning with salt, white 
pepper, and a dash of cayenne, a little nutmeg, one ladleful of 
Espagnole sauce, and one of tomato sauce. Then add three 
handfuls of fresh bread crumbs, yolks of four eggs, and one 
tablespoonful chopped parsley. Mix thoroughly. Cook three 
minutes longer. Set away to cool. 

Potatoes 

Potatoes for baking or boiling whole should be of the same 
size, thoroughly washed and scrubbed with a brush kept for the 
purpose. They should bake in a hot oven from thirty to forty - 
five minutes, according to their size, and to boil have enough 
boiling salted water to cover them, and boil about thirty min- 
utes. Pare before boiling, except for salad. 



252 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

Plain boiled potatoes are served whole or rubbed through a 
fine colander and served like rice, or mashed and seasoned with 
salt, white pepper, butter, and milk, and served in mass or in 
fancy shapes and browned. Parisienne potatoes are cut in balls 
with a French ball-cutter, boiled ten or twelve minutes, and 
dressed with melted butter, salt, white pepper, and minced pars- 
ley, or sifted hard-boiled egg yolk. Baked potatoes are often 
cut lengthwise, removed from the skin, mashed, seasoned, and 
made light with whipped egg white or cream. The skins are 
then refilled, placed in the oven until brown, and served as 
souffle potatoes. Raw potatoes are sliced thin or cut in straws, 
dice, balls, crescents, curls, etc., and fried in deep hot fat. All 
peeled potatoes should stand in cold water until they are boiled 
or fried. If fried, dry thoroughly before dropping in hot fat. 
Cold boiled potatoes are cut in dice or thin slices, seasoned with 
salt and pepper, and fried brown in very hot drippings or butter, 
with a little chopped onion and parsley. 

German Potato Cakes 

This well-known German dish has been made a part of the 
cookery of our country, introduced by many of our German 
families. In making it grate the potatoes raw, add butter to 
enrich it, eggs and flour to hold the grated potato together, a 
little salt, and season with sugar and cinnamon to taste. The 
cakes are fried in butter on a griddle or in a flat saucepan till 
brown. 

Stewed Potatoes 

Chop cold boiled potatoes rather fine and salt carefully. 
Add milk — just even with the potatoes — and a large table- 
spoon of butter. Place this in a saucepan and cover. Set it in 
another pan of boiling water. Stir occasionally and cook one 
hour until creamy.

Potato Ribbons 

Peel the potatoes, then peel round and round very thinly. 
Let the ribbons lie in cold water for an hour. Drain and 
plunge in hot fat, using a frying basket. Drain off the fat on 
paper and serve hot. 

Potato Croquettes 

Add to the boiled and mashed potatoes half their weight of 
butter, and seasoning of salt and pepper, a trifle of onion, minced 
fine, and two well-beaten eggs. Form them in egg^ ball, or 
cork shaj^e, dip them in the beaten yolk of eggs and then into 
bread crumbs. Cover them, and let them stand for an hour or 
so. Dip them again in the egg and bread crumbs and fry in 
deep hot fat. Garnish with parsley and serve hot. Let them 
drain a moment before serving. 

Pockets of Gold 

Prepare the potatoes as for croquettes in the receipt given 
above. Scoop out the centre of each croquette and fill in with 
this salpicon : Mince cooked chicken, not too fine, but rather 
in dice size. Heat it with butter and add cooked mushroom 
dice and cooked pickled tongue dice, with salt and pepper for a 
flavoring. Thicken this salpicon with the yolk of egg in which 
has been stirred a dash of sugar, a few drops of lemon juice, 
and of some aromatic wine. After you have packed the salpi- 
con in the potato ball, press a little of the potato over the open- 
ing. Dip the ball in the beaten yolk of egg, then into bread 
crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat. Drain them on paper and 
serve them hot. 

Sweet Potato Croquettes 

Mix one pint of mashed sweet potatoes with one-half cupful 
of hot milk. Then stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter and one 



254 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

teaspoonful of salt. Beat one egg very light and add to the 
mixture. Next shape them in the desired sized croquettes. 
Dip in beaten egg, then roll in bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat 
until a delicate brown. Drain on brown paper and serve hot. 

"Wined Sweet Potatoes 

Boil the potatoes and set them to cool. When cold, peel 
and slice them. In a w^ell-buttered baking dish spread a layer 
of the potatoes, sprinkle with butter, sugar, and a little salt, 
then another layer of potatoes, butter, and other ingredients, 
and so continue the layers until the dish is full, having laid on 
top a plentiful supply of butter. Put a little water in the dish 
to prevent dryness, invert over the baking dish another dish 
that will hold in the steam pretty well, and set to bake in a 
moderate oven. After the potatoes are thoroughly heated, 
take off the covering dish, let them brown a trifle, and just 
before taking from the oven pour over them a little wine of a 
flavor agreeing with the potatoes. 

Rice Croquettes with Sauce 

Wash one pound of rice and put it in a saucepan with three 
pints of milk, six ounces of granulated sugar, two ounces of 
butter, and the rind of a lemon. Stir until it comes to a boil, 
then cover, and cook one-half hour. Remove the lemon, add 
the yolks of four eggs, mix well, and partially cool. Sprinkle 
fine bread crumbs on a board, turn the rice on them, divide and 
roll in a dozen large, cork-shaped croquettes. Dip in beaten 
egg, roll in fresh bread crumbs, and fry light brown in deep hot 
fat. Drain on brown paper, roll in powdered sugar, and serve 
hot on a folded napkin with sauce in separate dish. 

Sauce for Rice Croquettes 

Yolks of four eggs, four ounces of sugar, one ounce of corn- 
starch, and the finely chopped rind of one lemon. Mix thor- 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 255 

ouglily, add one pint of boiling milk. Stir with an egg-beater 
over the fire until the sauce thickens. 

Rice Fritters 

Boil a cup of rice in a pint of milk until the rice is soft and 
the milk is absorbed. Take from the fire and add the yolks of 
three eggs, one tablespoon of sugar, a small spoon of salt, and 
two tablespoons of butter. When the mixture grows cold, add 
the whites of the eggs beaten stiff. Drop in large spoonfuls in 
hot fat and let them cook until they are a golden brown. 

Spanish Rice 

One cup of rice in two quarts of boiling salted water. Boil 
fifteen minutes. Pour into a fine sieve. Place the sieve over 
boiling water and steam the rice for thirty minutes. Chop 
one-half can of Spanish peppers very fine. Mix with the rice 
and serve. The dish may be used as a garnish for boiled ham 
or mutton. 

Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce 

Place the ends of a handful of spaghetti in a kettle of boiling 
salted water. As it softens, bend and coil it round in the ket- 
tle. Put a cover on and cook fifteen or twenty minutes, or 
until tender. Drain in a colander. Then return to the kettle 
with enough tomato sauce to make it quite moist, a third of 
a cup of grated cheese, — American or Parmesan, — one table- 
spoonful of butter, and a dash of paprika. Cook slowly until 
the sauce is about absorbed. 

Spinach on Toast 

Boil the spinach in salted water until half done. Pour off 
the hot water, dash cold water over the vegetable, and having 
wiped it dry, chop it fine and put it in a saucepan. Make a 
sauce of one tablespoon of flour, the same quantity of butter, 



256 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

and a cup of cream or bouillon. Mix this sauce well with the 
spinach. Cover the saucepan and cook until it thickens. 
Serve on small slices of buttered toast. 

Spinach mixed with sorrel or young nettles is prepared 
in this way, except when sorrel is used some sugar is also 
added. 

Spinach Timbale 

Boil one peck of spinach in just enough water to cover it 
and add two tablespoonfuls of salt. When tender, drain thor- 
oughly, chop very fine, and set away to cool. Then put it in a 
saucepan with one-half pint of Bechamel sauce, one-quarter of a 
pint of stock, and two ounces of butter. Let this simmer slowly 
for five minutes. When cool, mix this with six ounces of veal 
forcemeat, the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, a little black 
pepper, and more salt if necessary. Place in a well-buttered 
mould and set in a pan of water. Cover with a buttered paper 
and bake in oven for forty-five minutes. Boil two potatoes, 
one turnip, and one carrot. When tender, cut them in fancy 
shapes and cover with a glaze. Invert timbale on platter and 
garnish with the glazed vegetables. 

Succotash 

Cut tender, juicy corn from its cobs till you have a quart 
of the cut corn. Cover the corn and set it away. Break in 
small pieces the cobs of the corn and put them to boil with a 
pint of beans. After the flavor is extracted from the cobs, 
take them out and let the beans cook till done. Then add the 
quart of corn you set aside and at the same time add salt, 
pepper, and cream to your taste. The water in which the cobs 
and beans boil should not be plentiful when the corn is added ; 
it should be allowed to boil away so there is little liquid in the 
dish except the cream. Butter and milk may be used instead 
of cream.

Broiled Tomatoes 

Pour boiling water over as many good-sized ripe tomatoes 
as you desire. Remove the skins, cut them in two — across, 
not lengthwise. Season with salt and baste with a little oil. 
Put them on a double broiler and broil over a slow fire. Baste 
them often with olive oil. When done, serve on a hot dish. 

Fried Tomatoes 

Pour boiling water over some large, ripe tomatoes. Remove 
the skins and place where they will become cold and firm. Do 
not let them stand too long. Have at hand a kettle of boiling 
fat. Slice the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, dip in 
beaten egg, then in bread crumbs, again in egg and bread 
crumbs, arrange in a frying basket, and plunge it in the hot 
fat. In a minute or two they should be a light brown and suf- 
ficiently cooked. Drain on brown paper and serve very hot. 

Stuffed Tomatoes 

Wipe clean and remove a thin slice from the stem end of 
six smooth, ripe tomatoes. Take out the seeds and pulp, being 
careful not to break the skin. Turn upside down to drain. 
Rub the pulp through a fine sieve, and mix with an equal 
amount of fine buttered cracker crumbs, one-half the amount 
of very fine chopped meat, or chopped oysters, or cooked spa- 
ghetti. Season highly with salt, pepper, onion juice, or fried 
onions chopped fine. Heap the tomato shells with this mix- 
ture, cover with buttered crumbs, and bake twenty minutes. 

Spanish Tomatoes 

One can of tomatoes, one can of Spanish peppers, two me- 
dium-sized onions, two tablespoons of butter. Chop the onions 
fine and fry in the butter until a light brown. Then to the 



258 MBS. seely's cook book 

Spanish peppers chopped fine, add tlie tomatoes. Mix all 
thoroughly and cook over a medium fire five minutes, adding 
salt and white pepper to taste. Pour in baking dish and bake 
in medium oven three-quarters of an hour. Green peppers may 
be used in place of Spanish peppers. 

Devilled Tomatoes 

Powder the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs and mix with 
one teaspoonful of mustard paste, one teaspoonful of powdered 
sugar, a dash of cayenne, and a little salt. Melt three ounces 
of butter and rub it in. Then gradually stir in three table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar. Stir all over the fire until it is scalding 
hot. Remove to one side, add two well-beaten eggs, and stir 
over the fire until the mixture begins to thicken. Stand the 
saucepan in hot water to keep warm while you slice one quart 
of ripe tomatoes about half an inch thick and broil them. 
Place in hot dish and pour the sauce over them and serve at 
once. 

Tomato Parcie 

Select six nice, small, fresh tomatoes, and scald by pouring 
boiling water over them. Remove the skin, scoop out the 
inside, and set in an ice-box. Cook some sweetbreads and 
put them through the meat machine. Also chop fine some 
mushrooms and mix them with the sweetbreads. Chop 
fine two truffles and set them aside. Make a sauce of the 
following ; One tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful 
of flour put in a saucepan and let come to a boil. Then 
add one cupful of white stock and the inside of the tomatoes. 
Let all boil well ten minutes. Add chopped truffies, some 
chopped parsley, and season to taste. Mix the forcemeat w^ith 
the sauce and stuffed tomatoes. Bake until tender, and serve 
on rings of toast which are cut with biscuit cutter and fried 
in hot fat. 



VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS FOODS 259 

Baked Tomatoes 

Take out the core of the tomato and season highly with 
salt, pepi3er, and one-half teaspoon of sugar. On each place a 
good-sized piece of butter. Sprinkle over with bread crumbs 
and bake an hour. Protect them with a pan of water in the 
upper oven. 

Tomato Toast with Mushrooms 

Empty in a porcelain saucepan a can of fine tomatoes, or if 
they are in season stew the tomatoes fresh for the dish. Cook 
and flavor with pepper, salt, and butter. Toast thin slices of 
stale white bread, butter, cover each slice with the stewed and 
seasoned tomatoes, and upon it lay a peeled mushroom. Butter 
the mushrooms and over each sprinkle pepper if your taste 
demands it. 

Tomatoes and Mushrooms 

Take a can of tomatoes, a dash of cayenne pepper, a heap- 
ing teaspoon of corn-starch wet with milk, and allow all to sim- 
mer till the corn-starch is cooked. Then add a teaspoon of 
grated or finely chopped onions, a can of mushrooms, and a 
good tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Cook together thor- 
oughly fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Mashed Turnip 

Pare entirely from the turnips the stringy rind, split them 
once, or even twice if they are large, and boil them till they 
are very tender. They take some time longer than potatoes to 
cook. When boiled, pour off the water, pressing them tenderly 
with a large plate to free them as much as possible from water. 
Mash them as you mash potato, but to insure their being free 
from lumps you may pass them through a colander or sieve. 
When they are young, they may be mashed smooth without 



260 MRS. seely's cook book 

this. Put them in a saucepan and stir them constantly for 
some minutes over a gentle fire to dry them, then add salt, a 
bit of fresh butter, and, if you wish, a little cream or milk. 
They should be simmered until the liquid is dried out. Mould 
low in a vegetable dish, dash pepper and lay bits of butter over 
the top, and serve. 

Turnip Dice 

For this method of cooking, the turnips should be young, 
mild, and fine-grained. After you have washed, dried, and 
peeled the turnips, slice them half an inch thick and cut the 
slices into dice. Dissolve an ounce of butter for each half 
pound of the turnips, drop them in the butter, and stew them 
very gently from three-quarters of an hour to a full hour. 
Season with salt and white pepper when they are half done. 
Serve as a vegetable or piled on broiled mutton chops. 

Vegetables a la Jardiniere 

Have at hand one can of French peas or one quart of fresh 
ones, a pint of carrot cubes, and one pint of turnip cubes, three 
gills of any kind of stock, three heaping teaspoonfuls of butter, 
three teaspoonfuls of sugar, and three teaspoonfuls of salt. 
Cook the vegetables until tender in separate saucepans. If 
French peas are used, put them in a strainer and pour over 
them one quart of cold water, drain, and place in a saucepan. 
Drain the water from the carrots and turnips. In each sauce- 
pan place one-third of the sugar, butter, salt, and stock, and set 
them where they will boil rapidly. Occasionally shake the 
pans, continue the cooking until all the stock has been absorbed. 
Spread the turnips on a platter, making the border rather thick. 
Heap the carrots on the turnips, then flatten the top of the 
mould, and heap the peas upon it. If desired, potato balls or 
cubes may be used in place of the turnip ; if so, one quart of 
the balls or cubes will be required. 



CHAPTER X 

SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES, AND FORCEMEATS 

How to make Good Sandwiches 

In the first place have bread which is close-grained and one 
day old. Each slice should be cut evenly and about one-eighth 
of an inch thick. Spread each slice with butter before you cut 
it from the loaf. After cutting, spread the slice with any mix- 
ture you may desire and cover it with another slice. Cut off 
every bit of crust and press the sandAviches together firmly. 
Cut your sandwiches in half, each half in quarters, and each 
quarter diagonally. Trim off all protruding edges of filling. 
Cover the sandwiches with a cloth wet with a very weak solu- 
tion of brandy and water and pack them in a tin box until ready 
for use. Fresh butter is preferable for sandwiches, as it is 
more dainty and delicate. If not obtainable, use best creamery 
butter. Many people when eating a sandwich spread with fish 
prefer Graham bread in place of white bread. 

Fillings for Dainty Sandwiches 

In making butters of various kinds for sandwiches, first rub 
the butter to a cream, then blend it with the flavor wanted — 
caviar, anchovy, sardine, lobster, cheese, parsley, chives, cress, 
chutney, chili, and horseradish are all used. A few drops of 
lemon juice improves any kind of fish sandwich. With an 
anchovy sandwich also add a few olives stoned and minced very 
fine. 

Wash a dozen anchovies and remove the bones. Reduce to 
a fineness by pounding the anchovies and the yolks of three 

261 



262 MRS. seely's cook book 

hard-boiled eggs. Mix in a little curry powder, two tablespoon- 
fuls of Parmesan clieese, a sprinkling of cayenne, and enough 
good thick cream to make a smooth paste. Spread on slices of 
bread lightly buttered, and the result will be some very accept- 
able sandwiches. 

Another idea in the way of sandwiches is to make the filling 
of horseradish grated and mixed with mayonnaise and thick 
cream. Spread this on the bread in the place of butter, lay a 
thin slice of cold roast beef over, then a slice of seasoned tomato, 
and finally add the other piece of bread, also spread with the 
horseradish. 

Still another variation may be obtained by finely mincing 
some olives, mixing them with mayonnaise and with cream, 
and spreading them over nicely sliced bread. Lay in between 
a slice of beef or mutton and a thin piece of seasoned 
tomato. When the bread is spread with some savory butter 
and covered with sliced cold roast beef and with either a small 
leaf of lettuce or with a bit of sliced cucumber, the sandwich 
is appetizing. 

Savory butters are most easily prepared. Many of them 
demand the fresh butter. Caviar butter, for instance, needs 
two tablespoonfuls of fresh butter which should be creamed, 
then mixed with one teaspoonful of lemon juice, a dash of pa- 
prika, and three tablespoonfuls of caviar paste. Curry butter 
is made by creaming one tablespoonful of curry powder. Sar- 
dine butter makes a good sandwich filling all by itself. To 
make it, remove the skin and bone from three large sardines. 
Pound them to a smoothness and add a little lemon juice, cay- 
enne, and one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Cream two 
tablespoonfuls of fresh butter and add, mixing all together very 
thoroughly. Sometimes some chopped olives are added to this 
butter, which is then used on the bread, the sandwich filling 
proper being composed of sardines boned and skinned and fla- 
vored with lemon juice. 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 263 

Peanuts mixed with mayonnaise dressing are much liked 
for afternoon sandwiches. Take the freshly roasted nuts and 
chop or roll them very fine before mixing with the dressing. 

Another excellent sandwich spreading for white or brown 
bread is made by mixing chopped olives and small crisp cucum- 
ber pickles — equal parts of these — with a seasoning of capers. 
Stir tliem together with a thick mayonnaise and spread on the 
bread. A vegetable coloring made from spinach will give a 
green color to the sauce, if that is sought. 

Dates and figs chopped very fine and moistened with hot 
Avater and lemon juice may be spread on thin slices of bread 
and sprinkled with finely chopped nuts. Finely minced ginger 
and candied orange peel may be sprinkled on Neufchatel cheese 
which has been moistened with a little butter or rich cream and 
spread on buttered slices of bread. 

Another filling for sandwiches is Oriental preserved ginger 
chopped fine and softened by mixing with a little cold cream. 
Candied orange peel and candied cherries may also be used in 
this way. 

Caviar Sandwiches 

Take a one-quarter pound box of Russian caviar and the 
juice of half a lemon and as much olive oil as you have lemon. 
Alternately drop the oil and lemon juice into the caviar until 
all is used. Then whip it until you have a firm white paste. 
Follow general directions for making a sandwich, but do not 
butter the bread. Spread the caviar quite thickly on the 
bread. 

Cheese Sandwich 

Pound one-quarter of a pound of American cheese in a 
mortar with two ounces of butter and one teaspoonful of 
dry mustard. When thoroughly blended, add a little tar- 
ragon vinegar. Spread on thin slices of bread and it is ready 
to serve. 



2Q4: MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

Roquefort Cheese Sandwich 

To three parts of the green of Roquefort cheese use one part 
of butter, a little olive oil, pepper, a little salt, and a dash of red 
pepper. Mix all into a paste and spread on thin slices of but- 
tered bread. 

Chopped Chicken Sandwich 

Take the white meat of chicken, chop it very fine, and mix 
it with mayonnaise dressing and a few olives chopped very fine. 
Spread the mixture between evenly sliced pieces of buttered 
bread. Use enough mayonnaise to make a chicken paste. 

Chicken and Almond Sandwich 

Chop the white meat of a chicken very fine and add half a 
pound of finely chopped almonds, two teaspoons of salt, one gill 
of sweet, thick cream, and a saltspoon of pepper. Mix these 
ingredients until you have a smooth paste. Whole wheat 
bread is best for these sandwiches. 

Indian Sandwiches 
Cut the white meat of a cooked chicken in small pieces. 
Take almost as much cooked ham and four freshened anchovies 
and cut in small pieces. Mix two cups of veloute sauce with 
one dessertspoonful of curry powder which has been blended 
with a little water. Stir over the fire until it becomes a thick 
sauce. Then add the chicken, etc., and the juice of half a 
lemon. Cut some thin slices of bread with a circular tin cutter 
about one and a half inches in diameter. Fry them in clarified 
butter until a light brown. Place one-half of the pieces on a 
tin sheet, spread with a thick layer of the chicken mixture. 
Then cover with the pieces of bread. Cream some grated Par- 
mesan cheese and butter to a paste, roll into round balls. 
Place one on the top of each sandwich. About five minutes 
before serving place them in the oven and warm thoroughly. 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 265 

Lettuce and Mayonnaise Sandwiches 
Season the yolks of seven hard-boiled eggs with salt and 
pepper, powder them, and then mix with enough mayonnaise to 
make a thin paste. Have slices of bread sparingly spread with 
the mayonnaise, cover each one with some of the small leaves 
from the heart of the lettuce. Over the lettuce spread the egg 
mixture. Follow directions about cutting them. Serve as 
soon as possible. 

Salmon Sandwiches 
Take a nice solid piece of boiled salmon, mince it very fine, 
and season to taste with pepper, salt, and a little Worcester- 
shire sauce. Mix all into a paste with melted butter. Make 
a highly seasoned French dressing of vinegar, oil, pepper and 
salt, and pour over cucumbers which have been peeled and 
sliced very thin. Then set them on the ice for fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Evenly spread two thin slices of unbuttered 
bread with the salmon mixture. Put a slice of cucumber 
between them and shape sandwich according to the general 
rule. You may prepare your bread spread with salmon one- 
half or three-quarters of an hour before serving, but the 
cucumbers should be added at the last moment. Canned 
salmon may be used. If it is, use the butter sparingly. 

Sandwiches of Fillets of Sole, Lobster, or Salmon 

Cook the fillets of sole in a saucepan with a little clarified 
butter, pepper, salt, and lemon juice. When done, put them in 
press between two dishes. When cold, divide each fillet into 
four pieces, trim, and put in a bowl with a French dressing 
made of white pepper, salt, vinegar, and oil. Have some small 
oval rolls at hand, cut off the tops and remove the crumbs, 
moisten the bottom of each roll with a little of the dressing, 
place a piece of sole on this, add a little mayonnaise sauce, 
cover with the tops, and serve. Sandwiches of lobster and 



266 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

salmon are prepared in the same manner. If desired each one 
may have a little finely chopped onion sprinkled over it before 
the mayonnaise is added. 

Sardine Sandwiches 

Take as many boneless sardines as are required, open each 
one lengthwise, being careful not to break them, and place the 
halves on a fine wire broiler. When they have broiled a little 
on each side, set them away to cool. When cold, squeeze a 
little lemon juice over them, and cut off the tails. If fresh 
butter is used on the bread, sprinkle a little salt over the sar- 
dines while they are hot. Allow two halves to a triangle of 
bread, and make according to directions. Ordinary canned 
sardines may be used without broiling, but they are apt to be 
very oily. 

Sandwiches a la Victoria 

Have at hand one dozen or more very small, round rolls, 
cut a small piece from the end of each one, remove the crumbs, 
and fill with the following mixture : Remove the white meat 
from one good-sized cooked chicken, have almost as much ham 
as you have chicken, and freshen eight anchovies and drain 
them. Chop all very fine and mix thoroughly. Add enough 
mayonnaise, flavored with a few chopped chives, to make 
a thick paste. Fill each roll, replace the ends, and serve 
on a folded napkin. Lobster may be used in place of the 
chicken. 

Baskets of Olives 

First have hard-boiled eggs from the end of which you chip 
a piece so that the Qgg will stand. Halve the eggs. Next 
pound to a paste in a mortar the flesh of olives, a quarter as 
much ham and chicken, butter to help the paste, and the yolks 
of the whites you purpose to use as baskets. 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 267 

Having well mixed these, stand the whites in a dish, fill up 
their hollows with the mixture, heaping it high and rounding 
it over mountain form with a spoon, drop over the baskets any 
piquant sauce you like, and serve. In the mixture allow about 
three olives to two eggs. 

Baked Eggs 

Take six eggs, two tablespoonfuls of chopped chicken, two 
tablespoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, one tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley, one-half teaspoonful of ground mace, salt 
to taste, and a very small dash of cayenne pepper. Boil the 
eggs fifteen minutes, remove the shells, cut them in half, 
remove the yolks, and mash them fine. Add all the other 
ingredients, mix thoroughly, and fill the hollowed whites. Heap 
in pyramid shape, brush over with yolk of raw egg, and put 
in the oven to brown. While they are browning, broil a slice 
of ham and cut it in as many squares as you have eggs. Make 
a cream sauce, serve the eggs on the squares of ham, and pour 
the sauce round them. 

Egg Chops with Tomato Sauce 

Mix one-half cup of finely chopped ham and one-half cup 
of finely chopped chicken with enough white sauce to keep 
them together. Form them in the shape of good-sized lamb 
chop. Chop four hard-boiled eggs very fine and season them 
with a little salt and white pepper. Mix with enough white 
sauce to make them the same consistency as the chicken and 
ham and give them the same shape. Place one on the top of 
each ham and chicken chop, dip in beaten egg, and roll in 
cracker crumbs, then in egg and cracker crumbs again. Fry 
in deep hot fat. When brown, drain on brown paper. Arrange 
on platter. Pour tomato sauce round the edge and serve. 
Have extra tomato sauce in sauce-boat. 



268 MES. seely's cook book 

"Egg Croquettes 

Cool six hard-boiled eggs, chop them very fine, and season 
them with a little salt and white pepper. Mix them with 
enough white sauce to make them keep together and form 
them into croquettes. Roll them in beaten egg, then in 
cracker crumbs, and fry in deep hot fat. Garnish with pars- 
ley and serve white sauce in sauce-boat. 

Devilled Eggs 

Take twelve eggs, one teaspoonful of French mustard, two 
tablespoonfuls of cold tongue chopped fine, one tablespoonful 
of olive oil, one-half teaspoonful of onion juice, and salt and red 
pepper to taste. Boil the eggs fifteen minutes and place them 
in cold water; this prevents them from turning dark. Take 
off the shells, cut lengthwise, and remove the yolks, being 
careful not to break the white. Rub the yolks to a smooth 
paste with the mustard and oil, then add the chopped tongue, 
salt, and red pepper. Mix thoroughly, fill the hollowed whites 
with this mixture, and serve on a bed of water-cress or salad. 

Eggs in Nest of Spinach 

Boil four quarts of spinach, chop it very fine, season with 
salt and pepper, rub it through a puree sieve, mix it with a 
little butter, and add more salt and pepper if necessary. Do 
not have it too moist. Have at hand some very finely cooked 
ham and some veloute sauce. Cut some rings of bread. 
Spread the spinach on the bottom and sides of each one. 
Break an egg in the centre of each one. Place in the oven, 
cook for a few minutes. Mix the chopped ham and veloute 
sauce to a very thick cream, spread over the top, replace in the 
oven, and cook five or six minutes more. Serve with a cream 
sauce. 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 269 

Eggs a la Suisse 

Spread the bottom of dish with fresh butter, cover this 
with thin slices of Gruyere cheese, break eight eggs over the 
cheese, the same as for poaching, season with salt and white 
pepper, then pour a scant gill of very thick cream on the sur- 
face, sprinkle with Gruyere cheese, and bake in hot oven for 
fifteen minutes. Rub a salamander over the top, serve with 
thin pieces of dry toast. 

Egg Balls 

See Mock-turtle Soup, p. 82. 

Egg Timbale 

Break six eggs in a bowl, season with salt and white pepper, 
whip until very light, add one gill of cream, and pour in small 
buttered timbale moulds. Place the mould in a pan of water 
and then in an oven, and poach the eggs until firm. Invert 
the moulds on hot platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with 
Bechamel sauce. 

Curried Eggs 

Mix two tablespoons of corn-starch or wheat flour, a pinch 
of salt, and two teaspoons of curry to a smooth paste with a 
little milk, and pour into one scant quart of boiling milk. 
Stir until the mixture thickens. Then having carefully broken 
your eggs, slip them into the boiling milk. Let them cook 
until the white sets, which will be about two and a half min- 
utes. Then lift the eggs out with a ladle, lay each on a bit of 
toast neatly trimmed, pour over it a good ladleful of the curry 
and milk, — enough, that is, for the toast to absorb, — and serve 
hot. 

Poached Eggs 

The beauty of a poached egg is to have the yolk blushing 
through the white. Have a pan of fresh boiling water, break 



270 MBS. seely's cook book 

the egg in a saucer, pull the pan to one side, drop in the eggs, 
one at a time. Then stand the pan over a moderate fire. As 
soon as the water boils, the eggs are done. Remove, trim off 
the ragged edges, and serve on hot buttered toast. 

Poached Eggs with Mushrooms 

Put a quarter of a pound of mushrooms in a saucepan. Add 
salt, pepper, a little lemon juice, and a tablespoon of butter. 
After the mixture has cooked slowly for fifteen minutes, add a 
third of a wine-glass of wine and a gill of Bechamel sauce, and 
boil for a moment longer. 

Pour the sauce in the midst of ten or twelve freshly poached 
eggs, heaping the mushrooms in a mound in the centre. If the 
mushrooms are of the button variety, a button may be placed 
in the centre of each egg. 

To boil and poach Eggs, according to Directions issued by the 
Department of Agriculture of the United States 

"The directions given for preparing soft-cooked, medium- 
cooked, and hard-cooked eggs vary. The methods described 
in standard cookery books without doubt give the desired 
results if sufficient care is exercised. The chief difficulty 
encountered by most cooks is to secure uniform results, espe- 
cially with soft-cooked and medium-cooked eggs. It must be 
remembered that such results cannot be expected when condi- 
tions vary. The time of cooking, the amount of water used, 
the number, size, and freshness of the eggs, and the kind of 
vessels used are important factors. Thus, eggs which have 
been kept in an ice-chest require more heat to warm them 
before cooking begins than do those which have been kept at 
room temperature. Again, so apparently trivial a detail as 
the sort of vessel used (whether earthen or metal) or the place 
where the vessel stands during cooking may produce very dif- 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 271 

ferent results. Many persons prefer to have eggs cooked at table 
in a chafinQf-disli or other suitable vessel. In such cases the con- 
ditions may be controlled with comparative ease, and uniform re- 
sults obtained with a little practice if sufficient care is observed. 

"The following methods of preparing soft-cooked and 
medium-cooked eggs have been found to give uniform results 
in laboratory tests at the University of Illinois : Using a gran- 
iteware stewpan of one quart capacity, one pint of water was 
heated over a gas flame ; when the water boiled the gas was 
turned off, and an egg which had been kept in a refrigerator 
was dropped into the water. Without disturbing the vessel 
it was covered closely, and the egg allowed to remain in the 
water six minutes. It was then soft-cooked. As shown by 
tests when the egg was dropped into the water, the temperature 
fell almost at once to 185° P\, and then slowly to 170-171° F. 
If the egg remained in the water eight minutes, it was medium- 
cooked. In this case the temperature of the water at the end 
of the cooking period had fallen to 162-164° F. 

" Uniform results can be obtained in the kitchen as well as 
in the laboratory if sufficient attention is given to detail. Bear- 
ing clearly in mind the end desired, each cook must experiment 
for herself, as it is impossible to give directions which will 
apply to all cases. 

" The same changes which have been noted above as taking 
place in egg yolk and white, when heat is applied, in preparing 
boiled eggs, take place when other methods of cooking are fol- 
lowed, though they are not always apparent. 

" Poached or dropped eggs are removed from the shell and 
then cooked in water. Thudichum recommends the use of 
salted water to which a very little vinegar has been added. 
The reason for this is, perhaps, that acetic acid (vinegar) tends 
to precipitate albumen, that is, to prevent a loss due to some 
of the egg being dissolved in the water. Flavor may also be 
one of the objects sought."

Scrambled Eggs on Canapes 

Select four large, heavy mushrooms and four a little 
smaller. Remove the stems, peel, wash and dry, and chop 
them very fine. Put one tablespoonful of butter in a pan, and 
when it has melted add one teaspoonful of finely chopped green 
onions. Cook slowly for three minutes, but do not let them 
brown. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook two or three 
minutes more. Stir constantly, adding one tablespoonful of 
finely chopped parsley. Cook for a few minutes. Season with 
half a saltspoonful of salt and one-quarter of a saltspoonful of 
white pepper. Remove from the range, stir in a small piece 
of fresh butter. Mix thoroughly, then add six eggs, one salt- 
spoonful of salt, and half a one of pepper. Beat briskly for one 
minute. Pour in a hot saucepan with half a tablespoonful of 
butter and stir constantly over a slow fire for three or four min- 
utes. The mixture must be in small pieces and cooked quite rare. 
Have ready the eight mushrooms broiled. Arrange the larger 
of the broiled mushrooms on thin slices of warm bread. Fill 
each one with the egg^ cover with the smaller boiled mushrooms. 

This dish must be served very hot and the mushrooms must 
be cooked first, as the eggs must be served as soon as they are 
cooked. 

Scrambled Eggs with Peas 

Take six eggs, one tablespoon of butter, three tablespoons 
of milk, salt and pepper to taste, and one-half pint of cooked 
peas. Heat the butter and milk in an omelette pan. Break 
the eggs in a pan and stir till the mixture thickens. Have 
the peas very hot in another pan. Drain off all the liquid 
from the peas. Stir them in the eggs, season, and serve hot. 

Plain Omelette 
Beat separately the yolks and whites of eight eggs until 
very light. Then mix them together thoroughly, add a little 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 273 

salt and white pepper, and one tablespoonful of cream. Heat 
the omelette pan, pnt a good-sized piece of butter in, and, 
when it has become boiling hot, pour in the eggs. Slightly 
shake the pan until the eggs begin to stiffen. When suffi- 
ciently brown, fold double and serve at once. When an ome- 
lette stands, it becomes heavy. 

Oyster Omelette 
Chop one dozen large, fresh oysters in small pieces, 
sprinkle half a teaspoonful of salt over them, and let them 
stand in their own liquor, in a cool place, for half an hour. 
Beat six eggs, the yolks and whites apart; the former to a 
smooth paste, the latter to a solid froth. Add to the yolks a 
tablespoonful of rich, sweet cream, pepper and salt in sufficient 
quantity, and then lightly stir in the whites. Put an ounce 
and a half of butter in a hot frying pan, and, when it is thor- 
oughly melted and begins to fry, pour in the egg mixture, and 
add as quickly as possible the oysters. Do not stir, but with 
a long-bladed omelette knife lift, as the eggs set, the omelette 
from the pan, to prevent its scorching. In five minutes it will 
be done. Place a hot dish, bottom upward, over the omelette, 
and dexterously turn the pan over, having the brown side of 
the omelette uppermost upon the dish. Serve without delay. 

Spanish Omelette 
Take one teaspoonful of chopped onion and one tablespoon- 
ful of green pepper. Be sure both are chopped very fine and 
cook them until they are a delicate brown. Scald and remove 
the skins of three tomatoes, cut up and add to the mixture. 
Cook all for ten minutes, or until the tomatoes are done. 
Break six eggs in a bowl, beat them well and season. Mix in 
about one-half of the tomato, pepper, and onion. Put one 
tablespoonful of butter in an omelette pan and let it come to a 
boil. Put in the egg mixture ; and when it begins to set, put 



274 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

in the centre the rest of the tomato mixture. Fold it over and 
turn on to a hot platter. Pour some of the tomato sauce 
round it and garnish with fried bread. 

Tomato Omelette 

Make the omelette as above directed and have at hand a 
pan of finely stewed and seasoned tomatoes. Just before turn- 
ing, spread one-half the omelette thickly with the tomatoes. 
Drop over the other side of the omelette and serve at once. 

Egg Marmalade, a Jewish Receipt 
Clarify one pound of sugar in half a pint of water till it 
becomes a thick syrup. While clarifying it, add one ounce of 
sweet almonds, blanched and pounded. Let the mixture cool 
and then stir in gently the yolks of twenty eggs, which have 
been previously well beaten and passed through a sieve. Take 
care to stir continually the same way. When well mixed, 
place over a slow fire, stirring all the time to prevent burning. 
Flavor with vanilla or what you please. Wine or brandy 
might be used for flavor. 

Eggs en Cocotte 
Take two shallots, one onion, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
two tablespoonfuls of mushrooms, one tablespoonful of parsley, 
one-half cup of bouillon. Chop the shallots and onions very 
fine. Put butter in saucepan; and when it is melted, stir in 
shallots and onions. Cook slowly for five minutes. Add the 
mushrooms, parsley, and bouillon, and boil five minutes more. 
Put one tablespoonful of the mixture into a baking shell, 
break an egg in each one, then cover with the mixture, and 
bake in a hot oven for four minutes. 

Nested Eggs 
Take as many eggs as you want nested and strain off the 
whites, being very careful not to break the yolk, which you

leave in the shell. Set the shells holding the yolks in a cool 
place until you are ready to use them. Take as many rounds 
of toast as you have nests to make. Spread with pounded 
chicken livers, beat the whites to a very stiff froth, heap on 
the toast, then make a hollow in the centre. Carefully drop 
in the yolks. Set in a very hot oven for three minutes, or 
until they are a very light brown. Sprinkle a little chopped 
parsley over each one and serve. 

Egg Baskets 

From hard-boiled eggs cut a thin slice off either end so 
that the halves will stand upright. Having halved the eggs, 
mix the yolks with some finely chopped ham, or chicken, or 
tongue, allowing a tablespoonful of the meat to a yolk, and 
mix smoothly together with salt, pepper, mustard, and melted 
butter. Form the paste into balls, which will be about the 
size of the original yolk, and lay in the hard basket-form 
whites. Pour over all a white sauce, set in the oven for a 
few moments, and send to the table garnished with parsley. 

Stuffed Eggs 

Let the eggs boil until they are hard and cut them in half. 

Take out the yolks and mix them with cold chicken, chopped 

very fine, pepper, salt, a piece of butter, and parsley, if you 

choose. Place the mixture in the hard whites, uniting the two 

parts ; roll in the white of an egg and drop into hot fat and 

fry till light brown. Take them from the fat and drain. 

Make a sauce of cream or rich milk, thickened with flour, add 

the yolk of an egg, stir till smooth, pour over the eggs and 

serve. 

Eggs en Marinade 

Take six eggs, one pint of tarragon vinegar, twenty-four 
whole cloves, half a teaspoonf ul of mustard, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper. Boil the eggs fifteen 



276 MBS. seelt's cook book 

minutes. Remove the shells and stick four cloves in each egg. 
Pat the vinegar on to boil, rub the mustard, salt, and pepper 
to a paste, and add to the vinegar. When boiling, cook one 
minute. Put the eggs in a glass fruit jar, pour over the boil- 
ing vinegar, cover and let stand for two weeks. These are 
nice to serve as an accompaniment to broiled steak. 

Pickled Eggs 

Boil the eggs from twenty minutes to half an hour. Re- 
move the shells and put them in an earthen jar. Cover them 
with hot vinegar, in which has been boiled peppers, allspice, 
coriander seeds, cardamom, and cloves (half an ounce to two 
dozen eggs), or merely use plain, hot vinegar, and let them 
stand twenty-four hours before using. 

Creamed Cheese Balls to serve with Salad 

Chop very fine one small, green pepper, which has been 
parboiled, and core and seeds removed, and a very little 
pimento. Put in a mortar one-half pound of cream cheese, 
work until it is creamy, then add the chopped mixture, a dash 
of cayenne, and one teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar. Work 
into long strips about an inch in thickness. Put in the ice-box 
to harden. Have some nice, finely shredded celery, one red 
apple cut the same way, one cup of mayonnaise dressing. 
Arrange nice, crisp leaves of lettuce round your bowl, then set 
in the celery and apple already mixed with the mayonnaise. 
With scissors cut the cheese mixture into little balls all round 
the dish. 

Cheese Croquettes to serve with Salad 

Mix one tablespoonful of melted butter and one tablespoon- 
ful of flour with one teacup of milk. Place on the fire to let it 
come to a boil. Season to taste and stir in the beaten yolks 
of two eggs. Set away to cool. When thoroughly cold, mix 



SANDWICHES, EGG AND CHEESE DISHES 277 

with two tablespoonf uls of grated cheese — American or Par- 
mesan — and a dash of cayenne. Form into croquettes, dip 
into beaten egg, roll in fine cracker crumbs, and fry in hot fat. 

Cheese Timbale 

Mix one cup of cream, one tablespoonful of butter, and two 
tablespoonfuls of flour together, and stir over a moderate fire 
until the mixture comes to a boil, then stir in five tablespoon- 
fuls of grated Parmesan cheese. Strain through a puree sieve 
and set away. When cold, stir in three well-beaten eggs and 
salt and white pepper to taste. Grease some small timbale 
moulds. Decorate the inside with truffles. Pour the mixture 
in, then set in pan of water, and bake in hot oven for ten 
minutes. Serve with cheese sauce. 

Pot Cheese 

Place over the fire a pan of milk which has soured and 
thickened. When it has become scalding hot, ladle the curd 
and whey into a muslin bag, and hang up the bag to drain for 
an hour or two. Then take the curd from the bag, moisten 
with thick cream, mix in a small quantity of salt, work well 
with the hands, and either form in a mound, in a glass dish, or 
roll in balls. Keep well covered, in a cool place, and serve 
cold. 

Fondue of Parmesan Cheese 

Mix two ounces of flour with two ounces of butter, a very 
little salt and white pepper, and half a pint of milk. Stir over 
the fire until it boils. Work it quickly with the spoon until it 
is perfectly smooth, then add six ounces of Parmesan cheese 
and the well-beaten yolks of six eggs. Whip the whites quite 
firm and lightly stir them in. Fill a souffle case with this 
mixture. Bake in quick oven and send to the table as soon as 
it is ready.

Golden Buck 



Heat one egg in a small saucepan. Add to it five ounces of 
soft American cheese broken in small bits, one level table- 
spoonful of butter, one-third of a teaspoonful of salt, a level 
teaspoonful of mustard, a dash of cayenne pepper, and five table- 
spoonfuls of milk. Toast five slices of bread, keep them warm. 
Place the saucepan containing the cheese mixture into another 
of boiling water and stir constantly until the cheese is almost 
creamy. Set the pan where the contents will keep warm and 
yet not cook any more. Poach or drop ten eggs in boiling 
salted water. Spread the cheese mixture on the toast, arrange 
on a warm dish, putting two poached eggs on each slice of 
toast. Serve at once. 

Gherkin Buck 

Convert into a soft pulp, by a constant stirring in a saucepan 
over a fire, a half pound or so of good American cheese well 
sprinkled with pepper and wet with ale. To a pound of cheese 
allow a teacup of ale. When very hot, which will be in from 
three to five minutes, pour over hot toast, and upon the top of 
each piece of toast lay a thin slice of broiled bacon. Serve hot.

all the time, and add a little more beer if it is needed. When 
the cheese is melted and creamy, serve at once on the toast. 
Milk may be used in place of beer. 

Welsh Rarebit 

Take four ounces of cheese, half an ounce of butter, a spoon- 
ful of made mustard, two tablespoonfuls of cream, cayenne and 
black pepper to taste. 

Grate or chop the cheese in a bowl and rub all the ingre- 
dients to a uniform paste, adding a tablespoonful of milk, ale, 
porter, beer, or Champagne. Make a slice of rather thick toast. 
Dip it an instant in boiling water and place in the oven. 

Transfer the prepared cheese mixture to a saucepan and 
stir over a gentle heat until melted, then heat up quickly and 
pour upon the toast, and serve. 

Swiss Rarebit 

Take as many eggs as you wish — the number being based 
on the number of your guests — and weigh them. For your 
cheese take a third of the weight of the eggs and for butter a 
sixth of the weight of the eggs. Beat the eggs in a saucej)an, 
grate or cut in small pieces the cheese, add that to the eggs, 
stirring all the time, and then add the butter. Stir well over a 
good fire until the mixture is thick and smooth. Add little 
salt, a large dash of pepper, and serve in a hot dish. This is 
best cooked in a double kettle.

Forcemeat of Chicken 
Remove the raw white meat from a tender fowl weighing 
about four pounds. Mortar the meat well and rub through a 
fine sieve. Weigh it. There should be about half a pound. 
Place it in a mortar and in small portions rub in two table- 
spoonfuls of butter. Stir until it is well mixed. Then add 
the beaten whites of four eggs, one teaspoonful of salt, a quarter 
of a teaspoonful of white pepper, and a dash of cayenne. Then 
add one pint of whipped cream, measuring it after it is whipped. 
Mix well and put on ice for one hour. This forcemeat may be 
used many ways, — for borders, covering chops, tongue, quenelle, 
or to stuff boned squab.

Almond Pudding, a Jewish Receipt 

Beat up the yolks of ten eggs and the whites of seven. Add 
half a pound of sweet almonds pounded finely, half a pound of 
white sugar, half an ounce of bitter almonds, and a tablespoon- 
ful of orange-flower water. When thoroughly mixed, put in a 
well-buttered pudding dish and bake in a brisk oven. Before 
serving, strew powdered sugar over the top, or pour over clari- 
fied sugar with orange -flower water. 

Baked Apples 
Wash the apples and core them with an apple corer. Set 
them in a deep pan, sift over them sugar enough to make quite 
sweet, and fill the pan half full of water. Turn them over after 
baking a short time and bake slowly in a steady oven an hour 
to an hour and a half. Set a pan of water in the upper oven 
when you put the apples in the stove. 

Buttered Apples 
Pare six or eight apples of a firm flesh but of a good cooking 
sort and an agreeable tart. Cut out the core without piercing 
the outer flesh and fill in the centre with fresh butter. Set the 
apples in a porcelain -lined stewpan just large enough to hold 
them in a single layer, add a little water and stew them gently, 
turning them if necessary. When they are tender and quite 
done through, strew upon them as much sugar as will sweeten 
the dish highly, adding a teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon. 

284 



HOT PUDDINGS, CUSTABDS, SOUFFLES, ETC. 285 

Stew gently a few minutes longer, lift the apples to a hot dish, 
lay upon each apple a spoonful of apricot jam or a few blanched 
almonds, pour the syrup from the pan round the apples and 
serve. 

Utica Baked Apple Sauce 

Pare, core, and quarter nice tart apples. Put them in an 
earthen baking dish, sweeten and spice to taste, cover with 
water. Lay a cover on the baking dish and bake the apples till 
tender. 

Old-fashioned Boston Apple Pudding: 

Peel a dozen and a half of good tart apples and take out the 
cores, cut them small and put them in a porcelain stewpan that 
will just hold them with a little water, a little cinnamon, two 
cloves, and the peel of a lemon. Stew over a slow fire till quite 
soft, then sweeten with sugar and pass through a sieve. Add 
the yolks of four eggs and the white of one, a quarter of a 
pound of good butter, half a nutmeg, the peel of a lemon grated, 
and the juice of a lemon. Beat all well together, line the inside 
of a deep pie dish with puff paste, put in the pudding, and bake 
half an hour. 

Apple Meringue, Plain 

Peel, core, and slice ten or twelve good-sized apples. Cook 
them until they are of a good consistency with three ounces of 
granulated sugar, two ounces of butter, and the chopped rind of 
a lemon. When thoroughly cooked, shape in a dome form and 
cover with meringue. Fill a pastry bag with meringue and 
decorate the surface. Sprinkle with sugar and bake in a mod- 
erate oven until a delicate brown. Decorate with currant jelly. 

Bread Pudding 

Take a loaf of French bread and cut it in thin slices. But- 
ter and mix the slices with four ounces of raisins and two 



286 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

ounces of citron cut in fine shreds. Boil a pint and a half of 
milk with six ounces of granulated sugar. Remove from the 
fire and add the well-beaten yolks of six eggs and a little finely 
chopped lemon rind. Strain the mixture over the bread, let it 
stand for ten minutes, and bake in pudding dish for half an hour 
until it is light brown. Serve hot with any kind of pudding 
sauce. 

Bread Pudding 

Soak a pint of fine bread crumbs in a pint of milk, and when 
soft add three tablespoons of cocoa well mixed with a little 
water. To another pint of milk add half a cup of sugar and 
three well-beaten eggs. Blend all the ingredients and add half 
a teaspoon of salt. Pour into a well-buttered pudding dish, 
set the dish in a pan of hot water, and bake an hour. Serve 
with a cream either whipped or not whipped, and flavored with 
vanilla. 

Cabinet Pudding 

Have at hand one and a half ounces of candied orange peel, 
four dozen sultana raisins, four ounces of currants, one pint of 
milk, four eggs, the grated rind of one lemon, three tablespoon- 
f uls of granulated sugar, and a few slices of sponge cake. Rub 
a pudding mould with melted butter. Then cut the orange 
peel into thin slices and arrange in the bottom of the mould. 
Fill in the spaces with raisins and currants. Arrange a few 
slices of sponge cake, moisten them with a few drops of melted 
butter, and sprinkle them with currants. Proceed in this 
manner until the mould is nearly full. Mix the milk with the 
grated lemon rind, sugar, the eggs, which should be well beaten, 
and a little bit of grated nutmeg. Strain and pour into the 
mould, which should be quite full. Tie a piece of buttered 
paper over it and let it stand for two hours. Then tie it 
tightly in a cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and cook for 
one hour. Remove from the water, let it stand a minute or

two, and then remove the cloth. Invert it on a disli, and serve 
with sweet sauce in a separate dish. In place of the lemon 
rind, any desired flavoring may be used, and it will be much 
richer if cream is used instead of milk. 

Cream of Chestnuts with Caramel Sugar 

Cook tender, in enough water to cover them, one pound of 
shelled and peeled chestnuts with a scant one-quarter of a va- 
nilla bean. When cool, pound them in a mortar and rub through 
a puree sieve. Mix with the well-beaten yolks of four eggs, 
five entire eggs well beaten, half a pound of granulated sugar, 
and one pint of milk. Mix thoroughly and again rub through 
a puree sieve. Cover the bottom of a timbale mould with one 
gill of caramel sugar. When cold, butter the sides of the 
mould and fill it with the chestnut mixture. Set the mould in 
a pan with hot water to half its height. Place it on top of the 
range, and when the cream comes to a boil, cover it with a 
paper, and set the pan in a slack oven where the mixture will 
cook without boiling for one hour, or until it is firm to the 
touch in the centre of mould. Serve, pouring over it the cara- 
mel sugar, which is in the bottom of the mould. 

To make Caramel Sugar 

Mix one pound of granulated sugar with a gill of cold water, 
boil over a brisk fire until it has passed the clear brittle state, 
and is a light brown. Place in a pan of cold water to prevent 
its turning any darker. Use as soon as possible. 

Chestnut Pudding 

Boil twenty-five chestnuts, remove the shells, and rub the 

alp through a sieve. Mix with one-half pint of cream two 

unces of butter, three ounces of granulated sugar, and a little 

ialt and vanilla to taste. Stir these ingredients over the fire 



288 MRS. sei:lt's cook book 

until the preparation begins to thicken, then stir it briskly to 
prevent it from sticking to the pan. As soon as it leaves the 
sides of the pan, remove from the fire, and add the well-beaten 
yolks of four eggs and the whites of three eggs whipped firm. 
Butter a plain mould and fill it with the mixture, fastening the 
cover on securely. Steam for one hour and a half. When 
cooked, invert it on a dish, pour some warm diluted apricot jam 
over it and serve. 

Chocolate Blanc-mange 

Soak seven sheets of sheet gelatine in half a cup of cold 
water. Boil together for five minutes one quart of hot milk, 
one cup of sugar, two ounces of grated chocolate, and a little salt. 
Flavor with vanilla after adding the dissolved gelatine, stirring 
constantly. Wet the mould with cold water, pour in, and set 
away to harden. 

Chocolate Pudding 

Soak one pint of bread crumbs in one quart of milk. See 
that the bread is thoroughly dissolved. Mix one ounce of 
grated chocolate with three tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar 
and one tablespoonful of boiling water. Stir constantly over a 
brisk fire until it becomes smooth. Remove from the fire, stir 
in a few spoonfuls of bread and milk. Stir until it is smooth, 
and then mix with the rest of the bread and milk. Beat the 
yolks of four eggs and the white of one egg together, and mix 
with one-quarter of a cup of granulated sugar and one teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Stir into the bread mixture. Pour into a pudding 
dish and bake in slow oven for forty minutes. Beat the whites 
of three eggs to a stiff froth, stir in three tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar, and flavor with vanilla extract. Spread this 
over the pudding and bake twenty minutes longer with the 
oven door open. Whipped cream is very nice served as a 
sauce. This pudding may be served hot or cold. 



HOT PUDDINGS, CUSTARDS, SOUFFLES, ETC. 289 



Chocolate Pudding 

To a little more than a pint of milk add three tablespoons 
of grated chocolate and beat together in a double boiler. 
When thoroughly heated, add two tablespoons of corn-starch 
wet with a little cold milk. Take from the fire and add the 
yolks of four eggs in which a cup of sugar has been beaten, 
put in a pudding pan, set this pan in another pan of hot water, 
and bake in the oven till the eggs are set. Make a meringue 
of the whites of the eggs and one cup of sugar, spread over the 
top, and brown. Vanilla flavoring should be used in the pud- 
ding and meringue. 

Cocoanut Custard 

Boil one quart of milk, and at the boiling-point add three 
tablespoonfuls of corn flour, blended in a little water. Remove 
the saucepan from the fire and stir in one-qaarter of a pound 
of butter. Let it stand until perfectly cold. Beat up sepa- 
rately the yolks and whites of six eggs until very light. To 
the beaten yolks add three-quarters of a pound of sugar and the 
grated pulp of one cocoanut. Put this mixture into the milk 
with the whites of the eggs. Line a dish or dishes with pie 
pastry, fill with the custard, and bake. Serve hot. 

Cocoanut Pudding 

In one boiling quart of milk gradually stir a scant three- 
quarters of a cup of farina. Let this boil fifteen minutes, then 
add one cup of grated cocoanut and three well-beaten eggs. 
Stir briskly to prevent the eggs curdling. Butter a melon 
mould and line with very fine bread crumbs. Pour the mix- 
ture into it, place the mould in a pan of water, and bake in a 
moderate oven for three-quarters of an hour. Serve hot with 
wine sauce.

Indian Meal Pudding, Baked 

Take one pint of new milk, half a pint of water, and mix and 
scald. Turn the hot mixture gradually on six tablespoonf uls of 
medl. Put in a bit of butter the size of an Qgg^ a little salt, 
three tablespoonfuls of sugar, two of molasses, and one Qgg, 
Beat all together and bake in a slow oven two or more hours. 

Indian Meal Pudding, Boiled 

Take two cups of Indian meal, one cup of wheat flour, two 
eggs, salt, and sour or buttermilk to make a batter, which should 
not be too thick, but rather thin, to allow for the swelling of the 
meal. Boil about three hours in a pudding boiler. 

The best sauce for this pudding is scraped maple sugar and 
cream. By some a thick sour cream is preferred. 

Lamplich, a Jewish Receipt 

Mix together half a pound of currants, the same quantity of 
raisins and sugar, a little citron, ground cloves, and cinnamon, 
and eight apples finely chopped. Have ready a rich puff paste 
cut in small triangles. Fill the pieces with the fruit, bringing 
the edges of the paste together, and lay them like puffs in a 
deep dish, putting them closely together. When the dish is full, 
pour over one ounce of fresh butter melted in a teacup of clari- 
fied sugar and flavored with essence of lemon. Bake in an 
oven not too brisk. 

Lemon Pudding 

One quart of rich lemonade, four tablespoons of sugar, six 
apples pared and cored, and a pinch of salt. Bake in a pudding 
dish.

Marrow Pudding with Sauce 

Chop fine one pound and a half of beef marrow and twelve 
ounces of fine bread crumbs. Mix them thoroughly with half 
a pound of granulated sugar, half a pound of candied citron, 
candied lemon and orange peel cut in fine shreds, half a pound 
of currants, four well-beaten eggs, half a gill of brandy, one 
gill of Madeira wine. Butter a large round mould not too high, 
fill it with the mixture, and bake on a baking sheet, in a moder- 
ate oven for one hour. Invert on a dish, cover with the follow- 
ing sauce, and serve very hot : — 

Sauce 

Yolks of six eggs, three ounces of sugar, half a pint of 
Madeira wine. Beat the mixture over the fire with an egg- 
beater until it is thick and frothy. Serve at once. 

New England Pandowdy 

Fill a deep pudding dish (the dish should be earthen or 
porcelain lined) with well-peeled and cored apples of a variety 
that will cook up soft and retain a pleasing tart. Put in water 
enough to last during the cooking of the apples and give a 
"juice" for the eating, but not enough to make the compote 
watery. Over the apples lay a baking powder biscuit crust — 
a crust well shortened, but not so saturated with baking powder 
as anxious or careless cooks are apt to make it. Bake in a 
moderate oven till the apples and crust are done. If the crust 
cooks before the apples, invert a pan over the dish, not forget- 
ting a pan of water in the upper oven. Serve with a sauce of 
thick cream into which a cupful of sugar has been beaten, or 
maple sugar is stirred. 

Some cooks dust the apples with sweetening before putting 
on the crust. Peaches may be used instead of apples,

Baked Pears 

With plenty of water stew the pears till tender. Then 
place them in a pan. Add the juice in which they were boiled, 
making the pan more than half full. Set in the oven and bake 
quite soft, turning them once, and always set the pan of water 
in the upper oven to protect the fruit. 

Plum Pudding 

Three pounds of chopped suet, three pounds of brown sugar, 
three pounds of currants, three pounds of sultana raisins, three 
pounds of candied lemon and orange peel, three teaspoonfuls 
of salt, three ounces of mixed ground spices, three pints of 
brandy, one pint of black molasses, one pound and a half of 
bread crumbs, one pound of flour, and twenty eggs. Butter 
the moulds, tie in cloths, and steam six hours. The above 
receipt will fill twelve good-sized moulds. One half or less 
that quantity may be used. After being steamed the puddings 
will keep a long time, if set in a cool place. 

Plum Pudding 

One pound of brown sugar, one pound of raisins, one pound 
of currants, one pound of sultana raisins, one pound of suet, 
half a pound of citron, half a pound orange peel, six large apples, 
five eggs, one large cup of milk, one large cup of flour, one 
small cup of bread crumbs, one pint of Sherry, one pint of 
brandy, one tablespoonful of ground cinnamon, one tablespoon - 
ful of ground cloves, one grated nutmeg, and one teaspoon 
of salt. Chop the suet and apples, which have been peeled, in 
small pieces, cut the large raisins in half, the orange peel in 
small pieces, and slice the citron as thin as possible. Have the 
eggs well beaten. Stir all the ingredients in a stone jar. This 
will make more than one mould. Butter as many moulds as

Stew one pound of prunes, press through a colander, and 
add two cups of sugar. Beat the whites of five eggs and stir 
with the prunes, pour into a pudding dish, and bake ten 
minutes. 

Cream may be eaten with this pudding, or a sauce made of 
the yolks of the eggs, beaten in milk, with a little sugar added 
while cooking. 

Pennsylvania Quinces 

Rub the fir thoroughly from the quinces, core them, stuff 
the centre with sugar, put in a baking pan with a little water, 
and bake till tender. If they tend to dry on top, baste and 
cover them with an inverted pan. Serve with a sauce of cream 
flavored with brandy, wine, or vanilla. 

Raised Rum Baba 

Dissolve one compressed yeast cake in half a cup of warm 
water. Let it stand in a warm place for thirty minutes. 
When the yeast floats to the top, add four ounces of flour and 
a little more water to make it a soft batter. Let it stand in 
a warm place till it rises very light. In another bowl place 
one pound of flour, six ounces of butter, and two ounces of 
sugar. Mix thoroughly, and then stir in a pint and a half of 
warm milk which has been boiled and partially cooled. Next 
add the three eggs, one after the other, and one wine-glass of 
rum. Mix well. Add one ounce of currants with three ounces 
of raisins and half an ounce of citron cut in small pieces. Let 
this mixture stand one hour before adding the yeast batter. 
Work them together thoroughly. Fill a well-buttered mould 
about half full, allowing the dough room to swell. Bake in a

moderate oven for forty-five minutes. Just before serving, pour 
over it two liquor glasses of rum. Sprinkle with powdeued 
sugar and serve with brandy sauce. 



Sponge Batter Pudding 

Put half a pint of milk in double boiler and put it on to 
heat. Meanwhile, mix half a pint of milk with a generous half 
cup of flour, making a smooth paste. Add this to the milk 
when it begins to boil. Cook four or five minutes, add three 
tablespoonfuls of butter, a quarter of a cup of sugar, and the 
beaten yolks of three eggs. Let it get a little cool. Beat the 
whites of three eggs to a stiff froth and add to the mixture. 
Put it in a buttered dish. Set the buttered dish in a pan of 
water and bake in quick oven for an hour and a half. 



Sponge Pudding with Sauce 

One-quarter of a cup of granulated sugar, one-half cup of 
flour, one-quarter of a cup of butter, one pint of boiling milk, 
the yolks and whites of five eggs. Mix the sugar and flour, 
wet it with a little cold milk, then stir it into the boiling milk. 
Cook until it thickens and is smooth. Add the butter, and 
when well mixed stir in the well-beaten yolks of the eggs and, 
lastly, the whites, beaten to a stiff froth. ]Mix thoroughly 
and pour into a buttered mould. Place the mould in a pan of 
hot water and bake in a hot oven. Serve hot with the follow- 
ing sauce : —

Rum Omelette 

To two eggs, beaten thoroughly with two ounces of sugar, 
add one glass of Jamaica rum. Melt four ounces of butter in a 
saucepan and pour in the egg mixture. Stir on the fire and 
cook. When done, roll the omelette, turn it on a dish, sprinkle 
with powdered sugar, and send to the table. Have a glass of 
Jamaica rum at hand, pour it on each side of the dish, apply a 
lighted match, and serve when the alcohol has almost burned 
itself out. 

Strawberry Shortcake 

Put one quart of sifted flour in a large earthen bowl, add 
to it one-half teaspoonful of salt and three heaping teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder. Mix thoroughly, and then cream it with 
two heaping teaspoonfuls of butter. When this is done, stir in 
enough rich milk to make a soft dough. Butter three round 
pans, the same as for layer cake. Roll the dough on a lightly 
floured board until it is half or three-quarters of an inch thick. 
Cut it the same size as the pans and place it in them. Bake in 
a quick oven for eighteen minutes. Remove from the pans ; 
and when partially cool, butter the top of each layer. Prepare 
two quarts of nice ripe strawberries as follows : If necessary, 
wash and drain thoroughly in a colander. Place in an earthen 
bowl and cover them with powdered sugar. It depends upon 
the sweetness of the berry as to the quantit}^ of sugar to use. 
Crush the berries with a potato masher so that they may be 
thoroughly mixed with the sugar. Do not mash them to a 
pulp. Place one layer of cake in a deep round dish, spread 
it with the strawberries, cover with another layer, treat this 
in the same manner ; also the third layer. Garnish the dish 
with whole strawberries and serve with plain rich cream or 
whipped cream.

Strawberry Shortcake of the Oneida Community 

With a quart of flour sift thoroughly three teaspoons of 
baking powder and rub in one ounce of butter and a pinch of 
salt. Wet with a pint of sweet milk, stirring with a spoon. 
Do not roll out the paste, but spread it on tin pie plates, aiding 
by patting with the hand if necessary until the dough is about 
half an inch thick. Bake slowly at first till the cake rises a 
little and then hasten the baking, allowing in all about twenty- 
five minutes for the biscuit to bake. When it is thoroughly 
done, take a sharp knife and split it and spread each half upon 
its soft side with butter. Lay one-half on a generously large 
dish, and over it spread the strawberries which have been 
previously sugared, mashed a little, and mixed with cream. 
Having well covered one-half of the crust, lay on the other half 
and spread berries and cream over it as upon the first. If your 
crust is in small cakes and you have two, make your cake of 
four layers rather than of two. Work fast and don't lose a 
minute, for shortcakes should be served with the quickness of 
griddle cakes. Sweeten the fruit before you begin making the 
dough — say an hour before use. 

Peach Shortcake 

Make precisely as the above, using instead fine luscious 
peaches, peeled and quartered. 

Red Raspberry Shortcake 
Follow the directions for strawberry shortcake. 

Baked Apple Shortcake 

Pare and quarter tart, easy-cooking apples, enough to make 
a couple of layers on the bottom of a pudding dish. Lay the 
quarters on carefully, add a tablespoon or so of water, half a 



HOT PUDDINGS, CUSTABDS, SOUFFLES, ETC. 301 

cup of sugar, a little salt, any spice you wish, and a few bits of 
butter. Upon this spread a paste made as you make a straw- 
berry shortcrust. Bake until the apples are done and the crust 
is a light brown. Loosen the crust, turn the pudding dish 
upside down over a plate or platter, and have the crust and 
apples inverted. Separate into little squares and serve with 
scraped maple sugar and cream. 

Souflae with Apricot Sauce 
Twelve eggs, one pound of granulated sugar, vanilla to 
taste, and one teaspoonful of corn-starch dissolved in a little 
cold milk. Divide the whites of the eggs from the yolks. Beat 
the eggs till firm and white, then add the sugar, corn-starch, 
and vanilla. Beat thoroughly. Have the yolks well beaten, 
and with a spoon carefully stir them with the whites. Bake 
in souffle dish in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. 

Apricot Sauce 
Stew some apricots, add sugar to taste. When thoroughly 
cooked, rub them through a puree sieve. Strain the syrup, and 
then add a little maraschino or other liqueur to fancy. Serve 
with the souffle. 

Cheese Souffle 

Beat a quarter of a pound of butter, melted with the yolks 
of six eggs. Season with pepper and cook it over a moderate 
fire till it becomes creamy. Be sure to stir it all the time and 
do not let it boil. When it is creamy, take it from the fire and 
mix in three-eighths of a pound of finely grated Swiss cheese 
and Parmesan cheese. Do not have the mixture any thicker. 
Slowly stir in the well-beaten whites of three eggs and then 
stir in two spoonfuls of whipped cream. Pour into the souffle 
pan and put the pan on a flat sheet of tin. Bake in a slack 
oven about ten or fifteen minutes. Before removing from the 
oven, sprinkle well with grated cheese. Serve at once.

Chocolate Souffle 
Have at hand four eggs, three teaspoonfuls of pounded and 
rolled lump sugar, one teaspoonful of flour, and three ounces of 
chocolate. Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs and 
to the yolks add the sugar, flour, and the chocolate, which has 
been grated very fine. Beat these together for five minutes. 
Beat the whites of the eggs till they are stiff and lightly stir 
them with the yolks. When the mixture is smooth and light, 
pour it into a buttered tin and bake in a quick oven. It must 
be served as soon as it is cooked, else it will fall. 

Lemon Souffle 
To the well-beaten yolks of six eggs add a scant tablespoon- 
ful of powdered sugar. Beat twenty minutes, stir in the juice 
and grated rind of one lemon. Ten minutes before serving, 
beat the whites of six eggs until they are light and add to the 
yolks. Mix thoroughly and pour in a baking dish. Bake in a 
quick oven. AVhen cooked, sprinkle with granulated sugar and 
serve at once. 

Lemon Souffle 

Boil one cup of milk or cream with half a tablespoonful of 
butter. Mix one cup of sifted flour with one cup of boiled 
milk. Stir it into the boiled milk. Keep stirring till all is 
free from the bottom of the saucepan. When cool, stir in half 
a tablespoonful of butter which has been creamed, six table- 
spoonfuls of granulated sugar, and the yolks of eight eggs 
stirred in one by one. Flavor with wine and the juice of one 
lemon. Then add the stiffly beaten whites of eggs. Mix 
thoroughly, pour into dish, and bake for thirty minutes. 

Prune Souffle 
Stew one pound of prunes till very soft. Then rub them 
through a colander and sweeten to taste. Beat the whites of

Rub two scant tablespoons of butter to a cream, add two 
tablespoons of flour, and pour in gradually one cup of hot milk. 
Cook eight minutes in a double boiler, stirring often. Separate 
the yolks and whites of four eggs. Beat the yolks with two 
tablespoons of sugar, add to the milk, and set away to cool. 
Thirty minutes before serving, beat the whites very stiff, cut 
them lightly into the custard, and bake in a buttered dish in a 
moderate oven. 

Cream Sauce 

A quarter of a cup of butter, half a cup of pulverized sugar, 
two tablespoons of wine, and two tablespoons of cream. Cream 
the butter and sugar well, and just before serving place the 
bowl over hot water and stir till smooth and creamy. 

Suet Pudding 

Mix one cupful of finely chopped suet with one cup of sweet 
milk, one cupful of raisins, seeded and rubbed with a little 
flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one small teaspoonful of soda dis- 
■solved in one cup of molasses, and three and a half cups of flour. 
Place in buttered mould, cover tightly, and steam three hours. 
Unmould and serve hot, with hard sauce.

in a buttered pudding boiler of tin, cover to exclude all steam 
and water, and boil three hours. Invert the boiler, and serve 
hot with hard sauce or liquid brandy sauce. 

Peach Tapioca 
Pour over one-third of a cup of granulated tapioca enough cold 
water to soften it. Add to a quart of water in a double boiler 
the dissolved tapioca and boil until it is clear. When clear, 
take from the fire and flavor with a little fresh lemon, sugar 
to make quite sweet, and salt so that it will not taste fresh. 
Let the tapioca remain rather thick. Take one can of peaches, 
lay the peaches in a pudding dish, and sift sugar over them. 
Mix the strained juice of the peaches with the tapioca to make 
a proper consistency and pour over the peaches, covering them 
well. Set in a moderate oven and bake five or ten minutes. 
Serve with cream for a sauce. 

Strawberry Tapioca 
Is prepared after the manner of peach tapioca. The straw- 
berries should be set on the stove, sweetened to taste, and scalded 
only a moment or two. Place them in a pudding dish, pouring 
over them the tapioca. Bake five or ten minutes. 

Tapioca Cream 

Boil one quart of milk in a double kettle and add four table- 
spoonfuls of tapioca, which should have been well soaked in 
water. Cook until the tapioca is transparent, adding a good 
pinch of salt. When the tapioca is cooked, take the mixture 
off the fire, and that moment add three eggs well beaten and 
sugar to taste. Any flavoring — bitter almond, vanilla, lemon 
— may be used. 

Tapioca Pudding 

Wash three ounces of tapioca and boil it slowly for fifteen 
minutes with one quart of milk, stirring it occasionally. When

partially cool, add two ounces of butter, one-quarter of a pound 
of granulated sugar, and three well-beaten eggs. Season with 
vanilla. Butter a deep dish, cover the edge with puff paste, 
put the pudding in it, and bake in moderate oven for half an 
hour.

Almond Custard 

Scald, blanch, and pound very fine three ounces of almonds 
and only three bitter almonds. Mix thoroughly with eight 
custard cups of boiling cream. Place in a saucepan with the 
yolks of eight eggs, three ounces of granulated sugar, and one 
teaspoon of orange-flower water. Mix well over the fire to keep 
the mixture warm, but do not let it boil. Pour into custard 
cups. Set the cups in a pan with boiling water to half their 
height. Take the froth from the surface with the edge of a 
small piece of paper. Cover and cook slowly for twenty min- 
utes. Let them cool in the pan. Wipe the cups clean and 
dry, and, if desired, serve with a dish of roasted almonds. 

Banana Pudding 

Scald one quart of milk, add the well-beaten yolks of three 
eggs, one tablespoon of corn-starch, and granulated sugar to 
taste. Boil long enough to make a nice thick cream. Thinly 
slice three bananas, arrange in a pudding dish, then pour the 
boiled liquid over them. Make a meringue of the whites of 
the eggs. Cover the top and bake all in moderate oven until 
a nice brown. Serve when it is quite cool. 

Bavaroise with Chestnuts 

Remove the shells from one pound of fresh chestnuts. Put 
them with some water in a saucepan and cook over a slow fire 

306 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 307 

for two hours. When the water becomes black, replace it with 
clean boiling water. When the chestnuts are tender, drain, 
skin, and pound them in a mortar with two gills of sugar syrup, 
reduce to a paste, and pass through a pur^e sieve. Place the 
yolks of four eggs in a bowl and beat them up with four ounces 
of granulated sugar. Boil one pint of milk with half a split 
vanilla bean, remove the bean and pour the milk on the eggs 
and sugar. Place over the fire and beat with a whisk until it 
begins to thicken. Remove and add an ounce and a half of 
gelatine, previously dissolved in a little cold water. When this 
is stirred in, strain it through a sieve and add it to the chestnuts. 
Place the mixture on ice and beat well until cold, then pour it 
into a fancy mould packed in ice. Let it stand for two hours. 
Just before serving, dip in hot water and invert the mould on a 
cold dish, and garnish with chestnuts glazed in the following 
manner : Select the necessary number of chestnuts, cut a small 
slit in each one, arrange on a tin sheet, sprinkle with salt, and 
bake in an oven. When tender and cooled, remove the shells 
and skin. Dip in a syrup composed of one cup of granulated 
sugar and one gill of water, boiled until, when tested in cold 
water, it is brittle. Drain the chestnuts and arrange on oiled 
paper to dry. 

Maraschino Bavarian Cream 

Whip one pint of cream until it is like snow. Take care 
not to overdo it, else it will be butter. Stir in one and a half 
ounces of gelatine which has been dissolved in water and then 
strained. Add one gill and a half of genuine maraschino, the 
juice of one lemon, and four ounces of pounded loaf sugar. 
Mix well together and pour the cream into a mould previously 
oiled slightly with sweet almond oil. Set the mould in cracked 
ice, and, when the cream has become firm, invert on a dish. The 
mould being oiled prevents the necessity of dipping it in warm 
water. 



308 MRS. seely's cook book 

Vanilla Bavaroise 

Boil one pint of milk with one-half of a split vanilla bean. 
Mix four well-beaten Qgg yolks with six ounces of sugar, add 
the boiling milk, and stir over a moderate fire without its com- 
ing to a boil. Remove from the fire, and as soon as it begins to 
thicken, take out the vanilla bean and stir in one ounce of gela- 
tine which has been dissolved in a little water. When this is 
melted, pass the whole through a fine wire sieve and let it cool 
on the ice. As it commences to thicken, mix in three pints of 
cream whipped and thoroughly drained. Fill a mould with this 
mixture, cover with a paper the same shape as the top, fasten 
the cover securely, and pack in ice for two or three hours. At 
the last moment dip the mould in hot water and invert on a 
cold dish. 

Chocolate Bavaroise 

A chocolate bavaroise may be made the same as above, 
adding two ounces of chocolate dissolved in a little water just 
before the mixture is strained. 

Biscuit Glace 

Mix the yolks of eight eggs with one pint of rich cream and 
four ounces of powdered macaroons, ten ounces of granulated 
sugar, and a very little pinch of salt. Stir the whole in a stew- 
pan over the fire until the Qgg is sufficiently set or is quite thick. 
Strain through a wet cloth, and when cool add two wdne-glasses 
of maraschino. Freeze in the usual way. Just before serving, 
stir in one-half pint of whipped cream. Fill small paper cases 
and sprinkle each one with pow^dered macaroons. 

Birds'-nest Pudding 

Make an orange jelly. Invert a moderately deep pie dish 

in a round earthen basin — one that will hold about two quarts. 

Pour the jelly into the basin, covering the pie dish. Stand it 

in a cool place to harden. Next cut the orange peel in very 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 309 

narrow strips. Boil one cup of granulated sugar in half a cup 
of water until it hardens when tested ; to test, drop a little in 
cold water. Dip the strips of orange peel in this syrup and 
place on greased paper to harden. Scald one pint of milk and 
stir in four tablespoons of corn-starch blended with a little 
water. Stir constantly while it boils and until it thickens, then 
add one-quarter of a cup of granulated sugar and flavor with 
vanilla. Have ready sorue eggshells that have been emptied 
from a small hole in the top, fill each one with the liquid and 
set away to harden. They should rest in a pan of meal or flour, 
so as to be upright wdiile hardening. Have ready one pint of 
whipped cream. Turn the jelly out on a round glass dish, care- 
fully remove the pie dish, and garnish around the space left by 
the pie dish with the strips of orange peel. Fill the space inside 
the strips with the whipped cream. Carefully remove the shells 
from the corn-starch eggs and arrange these in the centre, and 
serve. 

Chantilly Pudding 

Beat the yolks of four eggs with one cup of powdered sugar 
until they are very light and creamy, then add the grated rind 
of one lemon. Whip the whites of the four eggs until they are 
very stiff, then gradually stir in the yolks. Use a wire whisk 
and cut through the mixture. Do not stir more than neces- 
sary. Add two gills of flour which has been sifted twice. 
Butter a cylinder mould and dredge it with sugar. Pour in 
the mixture, filling the mould about three-quarters full, allow- 
ing it room to rise. Bake in a moderate oven twenty to twenty - 
five minutes. Turn it out of the mould and set away to cool. 
Whip very stiff one pint of rich cream, sweeten with a table- 
spoon of powdered sugar, and flavor with one tablespoon of 
Madeira. Then fill up the hollow of the pudding with the 
whipped cream, giving it the shape of an individual charlotte. 
Pour the rest of the whipped cream into a bowl, flavor it with

strained strawberry juice to color it pink. Put the cream into 
a paper cornucopia and form it into rosettes around the pud- 
ding. Place in ice-box for one hour. Fresh strawberries may 
be passed round with it. 

Charlotte Russe 
Line the bottom of a charlotte mould with white paper and 
the sides with lady's fingers. Boil half a pint of milk with 
one-quarter of a vanilla bean. Beat the yolks of three eggs 
with three ounces of sugar and add the boiling milk. Stir 
over a moderate fire until it begins to thicken. Do not let it 
boil. Remove the vanilla bean and add one sheet of clear 
gelatine, moistened in a little cold water and dissolved in one- 
half gill of boiling water. Rub the whole mixture through a 
fine strainer, set it away until it is slightly thick, and mix it 
with a pint and a half of whipped cream. Pour into the char- 
lotte mould, cover the top with paper, and set on the ice for an 
hour or more. When ready to serve, invert on a dish. Have 
a cover for the top made of the lady's finger pastry, decorate it 
with icing, and, if desired, candied cherries, etc. 

Charlotte Russe 
Dissolve a fourth of a package, or two teaspoons, of gelatine 
in a fourth of a cup of cold water, and add it to half a pint of 
milk heated and three-quarters of a cup of sugar. Whip half 
a pint of rich cream, add to the gelatine and sugar, and stir in 
later the beaten whites of the eggs. Flavor with vanilla. 

Charlotte a la Parisienne 

Cut horizontally, in half-inch slices, a sponge cake, and 
cover each slice with a different kind of preserve. Pile the 
slices in their original form, and spread over the whole cake a

one tablespoon of vanilla extract, and when cooled pour into 
the moulds, which have previously been rinsed with cold water 
and sprinkled with granulated sugar. Set in cold place until 
firm. Serve with liquid cream sauce. 

Cornucopias 

One egg will make twelve cornucopias. Mix with it just as 
much powdered sugar and just as much flour as the egg meas- 
ures in a cup. Stir until smooth. Butter some tin sheets. 
Spread the mixture very thin and a spoonful at a time on the 
sheets. Allow sufficient space for them not to touch. When 
baked in a quick oven, they should be the size of a saucer. 
Remove from the sheets and quickly twist them in the shape 
of a cornucopia. Fill each one with whipped cream. One 
must work rapidly, else the cake will harden. 

Caramel Custard with Sauce 

Half a cup of sugar, six eggs, two tablespoons of water, half 
a teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of vanilla, and one quart of milk. 
Put the sugar in a pan over the fire and stir until it melts and 
is a light brown. Add the water and stir into a part of the 
milk, which has been warmed. Beat the eggs, add the salt 
and vanilla, and the rest of the milk ; strain into the milk 
which has been combined with the sugar and pour into a 
mould. Set the mould in a pan of warm water and bake 
thirty or forty minutes. To find out if the custard is done, 



312 MRS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

cut in it with a knife. If the knife comes out clean, it is done. 
Serve cold. 

Caramel Sauce 

Put half a cup of sugar into a pan and stir over the fire 
till brown. Add half a cup of boiling water and simmer ten 
minutes. 

Coffee Flummery 

Soak four sheets of gelatine in two scant pints of water over 
night. The next morning set the gelatine over the fire to melt 
and add a cup of coffee, made of the strength of two table- 
spoons of ground coffee. Set away to cool, having sweetened 
to taste. When the jelly begins to set, beat the whites of two 
eggs and a small half cup of sugar and add it to the jelly, 
then beat all until solid and white. Serve cold. 

Croquante of Oranges 

Remove the peel and white skin from six oranges. Then 
divide them by pulling them in small sections, taking care not 
to break the skin which envelops the pulp. Put half a pound 
of the finest lump sugar into a sugar boiler, with just enough 
water to cover it, and boil it down until it becomes brittle. To 
test it, when it begins to boil up in big bubbles, take a little on 
the point of a knife and instantly dip it in cold water. If the 
sugar becomes set, it is sufficiently boiled and will easily snap 
in breaking. Remove from the fire. The pieces of orange, 
stuck on the point of a small wooden skewer, must be slightly 
dipped in the sugar and arranged at the bottom and round the 
sides of a plain circular mould, which has been rubbed lightly 
with olive oil. When the pieces of orange are arranged and 
the sugar has become firm by cooling, just before sending to 
table fill the inside of the croquante with whipped cream, 
sugared and flavored with a glass of maraschino and some 
whole strawberries. Invert on a dish and serve.

Fanchonette 

Crush two cups of red raspberries and cook them with one 
cup of granulated sugar until they are thick. Add the juice of 
half a lemon. AVhen thoroughly cooled, stir in four finely 
crushed lady's fingers. Beat this mixture, a spoonful at a time, 
into the stiffly beaten whites of four eggs. Line a mould with 
blanched almonds and fill it with the mixture. Set this mould 
in a pan of boiling water and bake in the oven for twenty-five 
minutes. When cool, invert it on a dish and serve with cus- 
tard sauce. 

Gooseberry Fool 

Cut the ends and stems off large, ripe gooseberries and put 
them in a jar or bowl with a little water and a little moistened 
sugar. Set the jar or bowl in a saucepan of boiling water and 
cook the fruit until it is soft enough to mash. Then rub it 
through a colander, and to every pint of pulp add one pint of 
milk, or milk and cream mixed. Sweeten it to taste. 

Gooseberry Pool 

Top and stalk a quart of green gooseberries and stew them 
with a little water in an earthen dish till they are plump and 
tender. Put them through a fine sieve and sweeten the jam to 
taste and put it in the dish in which you wish to serve it. 
Whip a quart of thick cream till it is stiff, stir in a wine-glass 
of brandy and, if you wish, a little nutmeg. Heap the cream 
upon the jam and serve cold. 

Another Kind of Fool 

Another kind of fool may be made by taking a quart of 
strawberries and raspberries, a pint of each, mashing them, 
straining them, sweetening them, not cooking the pulp, but 
beating it with cream, after the manner of strawberry fool. In 
this the brandy may be omitted.

Apple Jelly- 
Take a pound of granulated sugar, put it in a porcelain 
kettle with a pint of cold water, and let it boil till it is a rich 
syrup. Into this syrup drop as many quarters of apples as the 
sugar will absorb, adding also the juice of two lemons. Boil 
until the whole is quite thick, pour into a mould, and set on 
the ice. Serve piled high and set about with whipped cream. 

Jelly a la Macedoine 

Dissolve an ounce and a half of gelatine in one quart of 
water, add three-quarters of a pound of granulated sugar, and 
the juice of two lemons. Mix in a saucepan with the whites of 
two eggs which have been well beaten. Stir over a slow fire 
until the mixture comes to a boil. As soon as it boils, add a 
few drops of cold water, skim off the froth, and strain through 
a wet cloth. When partially cool, add one pint of Sherry. 
Pack a round jelly mould in a pail of broken ice. Pour in 
a little jelly, and when that has set add a layer of preserved 
fruit, such as peaches, apricots, plums, etc. Then cover with 
more jelly. Continue until the mould is full, taking care to 
have each layer of jelly set, and alternating with different 
kinds of fruit. When all is well set, — it takes about two 
hours, — dip the mould in tepid water and invert on a dish. 
The preserved fruits should be well dried before putting into 
the jelly, as moisture would prevent the jelly from congealing. 
Fresh fruit may be used. 

Coffee Jelly 

Make one pint and a half of strong coffee, sweeten to taste, 
dissolve one-quarter of a pound of sheet gelatine in water, 
strain it, and mix with the coffee liquid. This jelly need not 
be cleared. Pour into a mould or moulds and when cold and 
firm serve with whipped cream.

Lemon Jelly- 
When lemon jelly is desired, make the same as in the first 
wine jelly receipt given below, but omit the wine flavoring, 
and substitute the grated rind of two lemons before cooking 
the liquid. After it is strained, add the strained juice of five 
lemons. 

Whipped Lemon Jelly 

Mix one quart of water with half a pound of granulated 
sugar, the grated rind of four lemons, the juice of six large 
lemons, and one ounce and a half of gelatine, previously dis- 
solved and strained. Stir over the fire until the sugar and 
gelatine are thoroughly melted and the liquid is lukewarm. 
Strain through a fine sieve. When the jelly begins to congeal, 
beat it with a wire whisk until it is frothy, then pour it into a 
mould and pack it in cracked ice. Serve very cold. 

Orange Jelly- 
Dissolve one ounce and a half of gelatine in a scant half 
pint of boiling water, then strain. Mix three teacups of 
orange juice with one teacup of lemon juice, strain, and add to 
the gelatine. Sweeten to taste with loaf sugar and boil five or 
ten minutes. Beat the whites of tw^o eggs with the eggshells, 
stir in the mixture, and strain through a jelly bag. Rinse a 
mould with cold water, pour the jelly into it, and set in cold 
place till it becomes cold. 

Wine Jelly 

Mix one box of Cox's gelatine with one pint of cold water 
and let it stand ten minutes, then pour in one quart of boiling 
water and stir until all is dissolved. Into a separate vessel put 
one pint of Sherry, one lemon, the rind cut up as for lemonade, 
the white and shell of one egg^ a little nutmeg, and about half 
a dozen cloves. When the gelatine is cold, add this mixture to 



316 MRS. SEELY'S cook BOOK 

it. Boil it five minutes without stirring. Remove from the 
fire and let it stand five minutes to settle, then strain through 
a flannel bag, pour it into moulds, and set in a cool place. 

Wine Jelly- 
Soak half a pound of gelatine in enough water to dissolve it. 
Add to it two pounds of granulated sugar, the juice of three 
lemons, the whites of two eggs, and two quarts of water. Stir 
constantly over a clear fire until it is nearly boiling. Place at 
the side of range, and when nearly cold strain it through a wet 
cloth. Flavor to taste with Madeira or any wine you desire. 
Pour into a mould previously dipped in cold water, and when 
cold and firm invert on a dish. 

Wine Jelly- 
Four pints and three-quarters of water, one pint and one- 
quarter of Sherry, three sliced lemons, two ounces of gelatine 
soaked in the water, three and a half cups of sugar, the w^hites 
and shells of three eggs. Stir all together and boil ten minutes 
without stirring. If this receipt is too sweet, lessen to three 
cups of sugar and taste. Set a colander over a crock or pan, 
lay a wet piece of cheese-cloth over it, pour the jelly in and let 
it drip through ; never squeeze it. Wet a dish with cold water 
and pour in the jelly when cool, and set it on ice till it hardens. 
For serving, take out the jelly with a tablespoon and slightly 
break it and pile in the dish. 

Lady Washington Pudding 

Sift four ounces of flour into a bowl, make a hollow in the 
centre, and put in the yolks of two eggs, three ounces of butter, 
the finely grated peel of half a lemon, and one tablespoon of 
cream. Mix all to a firm paste. Mix four ounces of almond 
paste with the whites of two eggs. Add to the other mixture 
and work it with a wire whisk for five minutes. Place it on a 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 317 

pastry board and work it for a few minutes. Form it in an 
oblong ball and place it on the ice for one hour. Tlien roll out 
the paste till it is one-fourth of an inch thick and cut it into a 
round piece — as large a piece as you wish. Lay it on buttered 
paper on a baking sheet. Brush over with beaten egg and 
bake in a medium hot oven till it is a fine golden brown. 
When it is cold, put one quart of strawberries in the centre. 
Sprinkle four tablespoons of powdered sugar over them. Whip 
one pint of cream and color it with strained strawberry juice. 
Whip another pint. Put a part of each in separate cornuco- 
pias and make a border of fancy rosettes, first one of white, 
then one of pink round the edge. Put the rest of the cream, 
Avhich has been sweetened with three tablespoons of sugar and 
flavored to taste Avith vanilla, in fancy shapes all over the straw- 
berries, making even waves as you go along. By using these 
waves the cake can be cut evenly and neatly. It is a good 
plan to cut the cake before decorating, as the effect is spoiled 
if the cake is cut way through after the decoration is put on. 
Place some small meringue shells filled with pink cream round 
the edge of the dish. 

Lemon Fromage 
Dissolve one cup of granulated sugar in one pint of water. 
Add the peel of one lemon and the juice of three lemons. Boil 
five minutes ; add one ounce of gelatine which has been soaked 
in half a pint of water. Stir all together until the gelatine is 
dissolved, then strain. When the liquid is cold and begins to 
thicken, stir in a pint of whipped cream, pour into a form, and 
place on ice for two hours or more. 

Matrimony 

Pare and cut in small pieces two dozen peaches, cover them 
thickly with sugar, and let them stand three or four hours. 
Beat them in a quart of sweetened cream and freeze. 



318 MRS. seely's cook book 

Melrose Pudding 

The whites of six eggs, one cup of powdered sugar, three- 
fourths of a cup of flour, half a teaspoon of cream of tartar. Beat 
the whites very stiff, lightly stir in the sugar which has been 
sifted, then add the cream of tartar dissolved in a little warm 
water. Stir in the flour, which has been sifted twice, and one 
teaspoon of vanilla. Dip a fancy shaped cake pan in cold 
water, dredge it with sugar, and pour in the cake mixture. 
Bake in a slow oven thirty minutes. Make the following fill- 
ing : Cut very fine three marrons, three candied plums, ten 
candied cherries, and one slice of candied pineapple. Soak 
them in maraschino for one hour. Whip half a pint of cream 
very stiff and stir in the candied fruit. Put in a cool place or 
on ice for one hour. Take your cake, and with a fancy cutter 
or a pastry wheel cut out the top. Scoop out the inside. At 
the bottom put some marmalade or strawberries that have been 
crushed and sweetened. Then pour in your cream mixture, 
replace the top of the cake, and cover with some of the whipped 
cream colored with strained strawberry juice. Pour the cream 
through a paper cornucopia and give it fanciful shapes. Spin 
a little sugar and put round the dish. 

Nesselrode Pudding 

Boil three dozen French chestnuts, and when they are done 
peel, pound in a mortar, and rub them through a sieve. Put 
this pulp in a stewpan with the yolks of eight eggs, one pint 
of cream, one pint of pineapple syrup, a little bit of salt, and 
vanilla to taste. Stir the mixture constantly over the fire 
until the eggs are sufficiently set, then strain it through a wet 
cloth. Cut in small pieces four ounces of citron, six ounces of 
pineapple — cooked in the syrup above alluded to — six ounces 
of candied cherries, and four ounces of raisins. Soak them 
three or four hours in two ounces of maraschino. Freeze in 



COLB PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERmOUES, AND ICES 319 

the usual manner. When about half frozen, add half a pint of 
whipped cream and the fruit. When the pudding is thor- 
oughly frozen, pack it in a mould and keep it covered with 
cracked ice until served. 

Meringues 

Have at hand one pound of sifted powdered sugar and the 
whites of twelve eggs. Beat the whites with a wire whisk 
until they become a perfectly smooth, substantial froth. Then 
with a spoon lightly mix in the sugar. Do not work the mixture 
any more than is necessary, else it will become soft and the 
meringues will be difficult to mould. The firmer the mixture, 
the better shape the meringues will be. Cut some heavy white 
paper in strips about two inches wide. Then take a tablespoon 
and gather it nearly full of the mixture by working it up at the 
side of the bowl in the form of an egg. Drop this slopingly on 
one of the strips of paper, at the same time drawing the edge 
of the spoon round the outer base of the meringue, so as to give 
it a smooth and round appearance — make it resemble an egg as 
near as possible. Place each meringue at least two inches and 
a half apart. As each band is filled, place it close beside the 
others on the table. When all the mixture is used, shake some 
rather coarse sifted sugar over the meringues and let them 
stand three minutes. Take hold of one of the bands at each 
end, shake off the loose sugar, and place the band on a board. 
Treat each band the same way. Place the board, or boards, 
side by side in a veri/ moderate oven and bake slowly until the 
meringues are a light fawn color. This will probably take 
fifty minutes. When done, carefully remove each meringue 
from the paper; w4th a desert-spoon scoop out the white part 
inside, keeping them nicely smooth. Arrange them on a tin 
baking sheet and put them in the oven to dry. Great care 
must be taken not to brown them any more. Just before serv- 
ing, whip some cream very stiff, flavor it with sifted powdered 



820 MES. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

sugar and vanilla, or any kind of liquor. Put a spoonful in 
each meringue, join two together, and arrange on a napkin in 
the form of a pyramid. Instead of the whipped cream you 
may use any kind of preserve or ice-cream. The board men- 
tioned above should be of well-seasoned wood and about one 
inch thick, its size proportioned to your oven. You must have 
ample room for turning the boards about. 

Apple Meringues 

Peel and core six nice greening apples and make a good-sized 
space in the middle of each apple. In a saucepan put two cups 
of water, one cup of granulated sugar, two whole cloves, and a 
little dash of nutmeg. When this comes to a boil, put in the 
apples and cook them till they are tender. Test them with a 
broom whisk. When one side is done, turn the apples and 
have care not to break them. When they are cooked, take 
them out of the syrup and set them away to cool. Strain the 
syrup and save it for further use. Into a bowl sift half a 
pound of granulated sugar. Beat the whites of two eggs to 
a very stiff froth and add the sugar by degrees, cutting the 
whites down and folding them over. When the granulated 
sugar is mixed in, add four tablespoons of powdered sugar. 
Put your apples in a baking dish, fill the centres with straw- 
berries which have been sprinkled with powdered sugar. When 
the apples are filled with the strawberries, cover each one with 
meringue. Put them in a slow oven for thirty minutes or more 
to color them a light brown. Do not take them out till they 
are thoroughly dry. Should the oven be too hot, the meringue 
will spoil. Take them from the oven, and when thoroughly 
cold with a long-bladed knife turn the shells apple side up. 
Whip a pint of rich cream, put it in a pastry bag, and form a 
rosette on each apple. Mount a strawberry on top and serve 
on fancy papers. The syrup the apples were cooked in may be 
used for bread pudding, sauces, baked apples, or deep apple pie.

Boiled Meringue Shells 

Boil half a pound of granulated sugar and a quarter of a 
pint of water for ten minutes until they form a large ball. 
You test the sugar by dipping a spoon in cold water and then 
taking a little of the boiled sugar and dropping it into a bowl 
of cold water. Then by taking the sugar between your fingers 
if you find it forms a ball, it has cooked to the right degree. 
Add the well-beaten whites of three eggs to the hot sugar, and 
stir constantly till it begins to cool. Then set it on the ice for 
ten minutes. Have a board well oiled with olive oil. Put a 
sheet of white paper over it. On this drop the sugar in spoon- 
fuls, either large or small as you wish. Put them one inch 
apart, so they will not adhere to each other. Bake in a slow 
oven until they are a delicate brown. Fill with cream, and 
serve as above. 

Lemon Meringue 

Dissolve two cups of stale bread crumbs in one quart of 
milk, add one cup of sugar, the beaten yolks of four eggs, and 
the grated rind of one lemon. Beat all together until very 
light, then pour in a buttered baking dish and bake in a mod- 
erate oven for half an hour, or until firm. Beat the whites of 
the four eggs with four tablespoons of powdered sugar and the 
juice of one lemon to a stiff froth and spread over the pudding. 
Place in a quick oven and bake to a light brown. This pud- 
ding may be served cold or hot. 

Strawberry Meringue 

The whites of seven eggs, seven tablespoons of powdered 
sugar, a quarter of a teaspoon of salt, and half a cup of pre- 
served strawberries. Beat the eggs to a stiff froth, then with 
a spoon gradually beat the powdered sugar and salt into the 
froth. Butter a two-quart pudding dish and line the bottom 
with meringue. Drop in the preserves by the half spoonful, 



322 MES. seelt's cook book 

alternating the fruit and froth until all is used. Bake in a 
moderate oven twenty-five minutes. Serve very cold with 
whipped cream. 

Porto Rico Witches 

Cut in thin slices, pound, sponge, or other cake, and spread 
half of each slice with guava jelly, or with straw^berry, raspberry, 
or currant jelly if wished. On the jelly strew thickly fresh 
grated cocoanut. Press over it the other half of the slice and 
trim the whole to a good form. Pile the slices in mountain 
form upon a dish covered with a white napkin and garnish with 
sprigs of myrtle or other tropical green. 

Pudding a la Prancaise 

Six ounces of crumbs, four ounces of flour, six ounces of beef 
marrow, six ounces of chopped apples, two ounces of mixed 
chopped peel, four ounces of apricot jam, two ounces of raspberry 
jam, five eggs, and half a pint of milk. Mix well, boil for three 
hours, and serve with liquid brandy sauce. 

Creanied Rice 

Boil one cup of rice in a little milk until it is well cooked. 
Use a double boiler. While the rice is hot, stir in a quarter of 
a box of gelatine, already dissolved in milk, and sweeten to taste. 
When cold, mix in one pint of whipped cream and vanilla too 
taste. Dip a melon mould in cold water, drain, and fill it with 
the rice mixture. Set on ice five or six hours. 

Rice Timbale 

Line a timbale mould with puff paste and set on the ice to 
cool. Cook two ounces of rice in one cup of milk until per- 
fectly smooth, add the yolks of two eggs, and four tablespoons 
of granulated sugar. Mix thoroughly and strain through a 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 323 

puree sieve. Stir in the well-beaten whites of the two eggs, and 
when cool, line the mould, which has already been lined with 
paste, with rice. Set in a cool place. Peel and quarter and 
remove the cores of two nice apples, place in a saucepan with 
two gills of water and four tablespoons of powdered sugar. 
Boil until the apples are tender and stir in six or seven pre- 
served apricots, six spoons of marmalade, and a little Sherry. 
When this mixture is cold, place in the centre of the mould. 
Spread more rice on top and cover all with puff paste cut to fit 
the top. Place in an ice-box for half an hour, then place the 
mould in the oven and bake for thirty minutes, or until the 
paste is a nice brown. Chill it thoroughly, turn it on a dish, 
and serve with whipped cream. 

Iced Rice Pudding a la Cerito 

Wash and parboil a quarter of a pound of rice. Drain it, 
and put it in a saucepan with one pint of milk, half a pint of 
cream, six ounces of granulated sugar, a little salt and vanilla 
to taste. Boil over a slow fire until the grains are almost dis- 
solved, stirring it lightly at times while it is cooking. When 
done, add the yolks of three eggs and stir thoroughly to mix in 
the eggs and to break up and smooth the rice. Pack the mix- 
ture in a fancy mould with a hollow centre and freeze. Pre- 
pare oranges in the following way: Remove the rind and white 
pith, cut the fruit in half, remove the core and seeds, leaving 
only the transparent pulp. Place them in a saucepan with half 
a pint of syrup made as follows: Cook half a pound of granu- 
lated sugar and a scant half pint of water till you have a smooth 
syrup. In this boil the oranges three minutes, then drain them 
on a sieve. Boil the syrup down to half its quantity, stir in two 
wine-glasses of curaQoa, and three tablespoons of apricot jam. 
Mix thoroughly and pour over the oranges. Invert the mould 
on a plate, fill with the oranges and syrup, and serve.

Snow Eggs 

Have at hand four eggs, three gills of milk, sugar to taste, 
and flavoring of lemon rind or vanilla. Put the milk in a sauce- 
pan with enough sugar to sweeten it and add the rind of half 
a lemon. Let this steep slowly at the side of the range for half 
an hour. Then remove the peel. Separate the yolks from the 
whites of the eggs and whisk the whites to a perfectly stiff 
froth, or until there is no liquid remaining. Bring the milk to 
a boiling point, drop the snow, — a tablespoon at a time, — and 
keep turning them until sufficiently cooked. Then place them 
in a glass dish. Beat up the yolks of the eggs, add them to the 
milk. Mix thoroughly and then strain through a wet cloth. 
Put into a bowl, and set the bowl in a saucepan of boiling water. 
Stir it one way until the mixture thickens. Do not allow it 
to boil, else it will curdle. Pour this custard over the eggs. 
They should rise to the surface. Set in a cool place until served. 

Snow Pudding 

Soak two teaspoons of gelatine in a little cold water, add one 
pint of hot water in which one cup of sugar has been dissolved, 
and the juice of two lemons. Beat the whites of two eggs, add 
and beat the whole mixture half an hour, or until it sets. 

Savarin a la Creme 
One-half cup of butter, one cup of granulated sugar, half a 
cup of milk, three eggs, one large cup of flour, and one tea- 
spoon of baking powder. Flavor with a little rum. Cream the 
butter and sugar, then the well-beaten yolks of the eggs, mix 
thoroughly and stir in the milk. Sift the flour and baking 
powder together and add to the mixture. Lastly, add the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs and the rum flavoring. Bake 
in a round buttered pan in a moderate oven forty minutes. 
This mixture will make two medium-sized cakes. When baked 
and thoroughly cool, cut out the top crust, remove the inside of 



COLD PUDDINGS, CREAMS, MERINGUES, AND ICES 325 

the cake, and fill with fresh fruit of all kinds cut into small 
pieces, and mixed thoroughly with half a cup of maraschino. 
Decorate with whipped cream and some of the fresh fruit. 

Waffle Charlotte a la Tortoni with Glaze 
/^ Make a batter of the following: Sift two cups of flour with 
one heaping teaspoon of baking powder and rub into it two 
tablespoons of butter. When well mixed, add one cup of milk, 
half a teaspoon of salt, three eggs, one after the other, stirring 
in one thoroughly before the next is added. Have your waffle 
iron hot and well greased, pour your mixture into a pitcher, and 
pour on the waffle iron. Turn every minute or two until both 
sides are a delicate brown. When all are baked, set aside for 
future use. Make the following preparation: Put in a double 
boiler the yolks of six eggs, two tablespoons of granulated sugar, 
three tablespoons of maraschino, and two tablespoons of Madeira. 
Put over the fire and stir five minutes, or until it begins to 
thicken. Then set it away in ice water to cool. When cold, 
thoroughly mix it with a pint of whipped cream, two tablespoons 
of powdered sugar, and one teaspoon of vanilla. Set in a cool 
place until wanted. Make a glaze of sugar and dip each side 
of the waffle in it. Lay one waffle in the bottom of the dish 
you are to serve it in and make a circle all round the dish. 
When firm on the dish, fill in with the Tortoni mixture. Set 
away to cool. Take a glass of red currant jelly, cook for 
twenty minutes, or until it will thread when pulled. Pull while 
it is hot into wicker and work round the waffles three rows 
deep, one at the bottom, one in the middle, and one on the edge, 
giving the appearance of a basket. 

To make Glaze to join Waffles 
Place one cup of granulated sugar over the fire with three 
teaspoons of water. Cook ten minutes. Dip in edges of the 
waffles and join while hot.

Reform Syllabub 

Soak a quarter of a box of gelatine in a little cold water, say- 
four tablespoons, setting the cup in hot water till the gelatine 
is well dissolved. Whip a pint of rich cream to a froth and stir 
in it three ounces of powdered sugar. Be careful to stir lightly 
and not break the froth of the cream. Strain in the gelatine 
next, exercising the same care, and as the syllabub thickens, with 
the gelatine, stir in also four tablespoons of Sherry and a small 
teaspoon of vanilla. Add two-thirds of a cup of blanched al- 
monds chopped fine, and pour the mixture into punch glasses. 
Set on ice till thoroughly chilled, and serve. The cream may be 
colored a rose color or green by the use of vegetable coloring. 

Biscuit Glace 

Dissolve one pound of sugar in a pint of water and boil five 
minutes. Let it cool, and when ready for freezing add a pint 
of rich cream and eight *or ten powdered macaroons. Serve in 
punch or lemonade glasses and garnish, if you wish, with can- 
died cherries and other fruit. 

Cantaloupe a la Buo 

Having washed and thoroughly chilled fine cantaloupes, cut 
them in halves and remove carefully all seeds and stringy part 
clinging to the seeds. Pack the halves with ice-cream, garnish 
with cold peaches cut in quarters, eighths, circles, or any shape 
your fancy directs, and serve at once. Other fruit may be used 
instead of peaches, the seasons and the interchange of markets 
sometimes permitting strawberries. 

Chestnut Ice-cream 

Peel and roast eighteen large chestnuts and boil until thor- 
oughly done in the syrup made with half a pound of granulated 
sugar. Drain and rub through a puree sieve. Dilute the syrup

with one pint of milk, the yolks of sixteen eggs. Add t\^lve 
ounces of powdered sugar and a vanilla bean cut in short pieces. 
Put over the fire and stir until the mixture thickens. Rub 
through a fine sieve and stir in one quart of raw cream. 
Freeze in the usual way. Pack in the mould and salted ice for 
at least two hours before serving. 

Chocolate Ice-cream 

Put a pint and a half of milk in a double boiler and scald 
it. Beat two cups of sugar and four eggs together. When 
they are light, add to the scalded milk. Stir constantly and 
cook for fifteen minutes. Grate one ounce of chocolate and

Baked Pears 

Wipe some large, sound, iron pears and arrange them in a 
porcelain baking dish with the stalk ends upward. Pour a little 
water over them and enough good molasses to sweeten them 
thoroughly. Bake in slow oven several hours. If baked 
slowly, they will be juicy, sweet, and tender in flesh and skin. 
They gain in flavor if they are basted now and then with the 
molasses and water in which they cook. If the oven is hot, put 
a cover over the dish while they are baking. 

Creamed Pineapple 

Chop, or better grate, a fine fresh pineapple and add to it 
the juice of a lemon. Take half a box of gelatine which you 
have thoroughly dissolved in a cup of cold water — if necessary 
by setting the cup in a dish of hot water for a time — and pour 
over the pineapple. Stir it well and set it on ice till a trifle 
stiff. Then add the beaten whites of four eggs. Mould and 
serve with whipped cream sweetened and flavored to taste. 
Instead of the pineapple, strawberries may be used, or peaches, 
or red raspberries. If you use the berries, crush them, while 
the peaches may be cut small with a silver knife. Chill 
thoroughly and serve. 

Pineapple Syllabub 

Beat the whites of three eggs stiff, and to them add gradu- 
ally three tablespoons of powdered sugar and a couple of tea- 
spoons of Sherry, or, if you prefer, a teaspoon of Sherry and one 
of vanilla or orange juice. Whip a pint of cream to a stiff froth 
and fold in, a spoonful at a time, the eggs and sugar. Have 
ready a fine, fresh-grated pineapple. After you have mixed the 
cream and eggs, add the grated fruit, stirring it in a little at a 
time. Put the syllabub in punch or lemonade glasses. Set on 
ice till well chilled, and serve.

sugar and half a cup of cold water and cook steadily over a slow 
fire ten minutes. Test it by dropping a little of the syrup in 
cold water. When you can form it into a soft ball, the syrup 
has reached the right degree. Have the whites of three eggs 
beaten so you can cut them with a knife. Pour the hot syrup 
slowly into the whites, stirring constantly. Place the bowl in 
cold water and stir the mixture until it is cold. Whip a pint 
of cream until it is stiff and flavor with one tablespoon of 
vanilla. Drain your candied fruits and stir them into the 
whipped cream. Put this mixture in the mould you have lined 
with strawberry ice. Put some more strawberry ice on top. 
Cover it securely and pack closely in rock salt and ice. Let 
it stand four hours. When wanted, dip your mould in tepid

Icing for Cakes 
One pound of sugar in half pint of hot water. Let it boil 
ten minutes, or until it becomes a small ball. Remove at once, 
pour it on to a well-oiled marble slab. When nearly cold, work 
it with a wooden spoon until it becomes white, then work with 
the hands until it is a creamy substance. Place in double boiler 
and stir over the fire until it is dissolved. Color any shade 
required. Pour over the cake while it is liquid and hot.

powder sifted with it. When well mixed, add the well-beaten 
whites and the rose water. Butter a large round cake tin and 
line the bottom with paper. Pour in your mixture and bake 
in moderate oven for one hour. When you remove it from the 
oven, be sure it is thoroughly cooked. Test it by putting a fine 
broom whisk through the centre of the cake. If the whisk 
comes out dry, the cake is done. Stand the pan on a wire 
sieve until the cake is partially cool. Make a glaze for the 
top of the cake as follows : — 



340 MBS, SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

To make Glaze for Birthday Cake 
In a saucepan put one cup of granulated sugar with four 
tablespoonfuls of water. Boil ten minutes slowly, or until it 
reaches a large ball. Have the white of one egg whipped very 
stiff, and slowly pour the hot sugar into it, stirring constantly. 
While hot, pour it slowly and thinly over the cake. Do not 
use a knife, as it will make the surface rough. Let it dry, 
which will be almost immediately. Make the following icing 
for decorating : — 

To make Icing for Birthday Cake 

Half a pound of powdered sugar, whites of two eggs, juice 
of one lemon. Beat the eggs for two minutes until stiff and 
by degrees add the sifted sugar, stirring all the time with a wire 
egg-beater. When all the sugar is used, beat well for five min- 
utes with a Dover egg beater, so the icing will be thoroughly 
smooth. Put a fancy tube in a pastry bag and fill the bag with 
the icing. Make a paper funnel with a ver?/ small opening and 
fill also with icing. With the paper funnel trace any design 
you desire on the cake, commencing at the extreme edge. 
Leave space in the centre for the initials or date. Follow up 
the paper funnel with the pastry bag and with this fill out the 
design. You must work rapidly, so the tracing of icing will 
not harden before the decoration is filled in. Color the 
remainder of the icing pink and put on the initials or date. 
Have some pink and white candied rose leaves, dip them in 
sugar syrup to make them stick, and put them round the lower 
edge of your cake. Before you begin to decorate the cake, 
place it on a round board, a little larger than the cake, and cov- 
ered with a fancy edged paper. 

How to write the Initials on Birthday Cake

Gingerbread Sponge 

Half a cup of butter, half a cup of sugar, half a cup of milk, 
one cup of molasses, two eggs, one tablespoonful of ginger, two 
cups of flour, one teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda. Cream 
the butter and sugar, add the well-beaten yolks of the eggs,

butter, one pound of raisins, one pound of almonds blanched 
and split, three-fourths of a pound of citron, ten eggs, one wine- 
glass of brandy, and one wine-glass of rose water. Mace to taste 
may be used. The lightness of this cake depends wholly upon 
the stirring, — there is no soda or baking powder, — and there 
should be no lack of patient beating. The sugar and butter are 
creamed together, the whites and yolks of the eggs are beaten 
stiff separately, and the other ingredients added in the usual 
order. 

Jam Cake 

Mix one cup of sugar and three-fourths of a cup of butter

and put in the oven. When dry, pound them in a mortar until 
they become a paste, gradually adding the white of one egg. 
Then add one pound and a half of powdered sugar. Again 
pound thoroughly, gradually adding the whites of two eggs. 
Spread a piece of white paper on a tin sheet, form your mixture 
in little rounds, a little smaller than a twenty-five cent piece. 
Place them on the paper about one inch and a half apart. Bake 
them in a slow oven for about twelve minutes, at the end of 
that time they should be well colored. Remove from the oven. 
When they become cold, turn the papers over and moisten with 
a little water, the macaroons can then be easily removed.

Roll out, and bake in quick oven. 

Green Mountain Boys 

Two pounds of flour, half a pound of butter, half a pound 
of brown sugar, a pound and a half of maple syrup, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt. These cakes should be dropped on greased

the thickness of the syrup ; if it is thin, add flour ; if too thick, 
add maple syrup till of the right consistency. 

Soft Molasses Cake 

Three cups of molasses, one cup of butter, two cups of boil- 
ing water, one teaspoonful of baking soda dissolved in a little 
water, three teaspoonfuls of ground ginger, and five cups of

Plum Cake 

Six eggs, half a pound of butter, half a pound of powdered 
sugar, twelve ounces of flour, one wine-glass of cognac, a quar- 
ter of an ounce of ground allspice, the finely chopped rind of a 
lemon, two pounds of mixed fruits, such as sultana raisins, cur- 
rants, sliced citron, and orange peel. Stir the butter to a cream 
in a warm earthen bowl, using a wooden spoon. Add the 
sugar and stir for ten minutes, and then, one by one, stir in the 
six egg yolks. Stir again for five minutes and then add half 
of the flour. When this is mixed, put in the fruits and brandy 
and mix again. Beat the egg whites to a hard froth, add to the 
mixture, and stir all thoroughly with the rest of the flour and 
a little salt. Line a buttered mould with a well-buttered paper, 
pour in the mixture, and cook in a moderate oven for one hour 
and a half. Cool, peel off the paper, and ornament with white 
sugar icing. 

Pound Cake 

One pound of sifted flour, one pound of granulated sugar, 
one pound of eggs, a scant pound of butter, a tablespoonful of 
brandy, and one-half teaspoonful of mace. Cream the sugar and 
butter and beat the yolks and whites of the eggs separately. 
Just before mixing, whip the brandy and spice into the sugar 
and butter. Then stir in the yolks and beat hard for two min- 
utes. Add the whites of the eggs and flour alternately, whip- 
ping with long side strokes lightly and quickly. The heavy 
work is done before these go in. Do not stir the batter after 
these are added. A pound-cake batter should be stiff er than 
that of a cup or a sponge cake. Bake in small greased tins, or 
in square, flat pans, in a steady oven. Test the oven with a bit 
of letter paper before putting the cake into it. If in five min- 
utes the paper is a light yellow, the oven is all right.

Princess Cakes 

First make a paste as follows : Place half a pound of flour 
on a board, make a hollow in the centre, and put in it half a tea- 
spoonful of salt with a little water to melt it, and add the yolks 
of four eggs. Work the whole well together, at first rubbing 
the ingredients between the hands. Finish working the paste 
by pushing it from you with the palms of the hands. Sprinkle 
with a few drops of water and knead it into a ball. This paste 
must be very stiff. Roll it out very thin, cut into bands, and 
shred them very fine. Spread these shreds on a sieve to dry for 
a short time, and then put them into a saucepan with half a pint 
of boiling cream, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, three 
ounces of granulated sugar, and half a small glass of brandy. 
Cover the pan with a lid and boil the contents very slowly un- 
til the shredded paste has absorbed the liquids. Remove from 
the fire and add the yolks of three eggs. Stir the whole well 
together and then put the preparation in two buttered tins. 
Have it about one-eighth of an inch thick. Bake in a moderate 
oven until a deep yellow. Spread one layer with jam or any 
desired filling, cover with the other layer, and then cut them 
with a tin cutter in small fancy shapes. 

Silver and Gold Cake together 

One pound of granulated sugar, half a pound of butter, 
three-quarters of a pound of flour, the whites of ten eggs, one

the sugar and work well for five minutes. When all is light 
and foamy, add the well-beaten whites and mix well. Sift 
your flour twice, stir it into the mixture, add flavoring, mix 
well, and stir in two drops of rose water. 

In another bowl put one pound of granulated sugar and 
half a pound of butter. With a wire whisk beat to a cream.

dry baking soda, add to the mixture, and beat all till very 
light. Butter a square or a round tin, dredge it with flour, 
put your mixtures in, a spoonful at a time, first the white and 
then the yellow, and so on, till your cake pan is full. Bake in 
a moderate oven forty minutes. If your cake gets too brown 
on top, put a piece of heavy white paper over it. Ice with 
clear white icing. Add a little orange paste to some of the 
icing, and ornament the border of the cake with it. Put orange 
leaves in the centre. These leaves can be made by taking white 
rose leaves, covering the surface of each with orange icing, and 
laying them in the crystallized sugar, according to the direc- 
tions in birthday cake.

CHAPTER XIV 
BREADS, PASTES, AND PIES 

Bread 

First of all sift your flour, and be sure you do not leave it 
in a damp place. Let it stand for an hour before you begin to 
make your bread. Put one yeast-cake into one cup of tepid 
water and let it stand in a warm place — not too hot, and in 
about fifteen minutes, if your yeast is good, it will come to the 
surface. At this point add a tablespoon of flour, mix well, and 
let it stand until you are ready to use it. Boil your milk and 
let it get cool, not chilled. Have your flour sifted in a pan — 
not too much, so that you can work it well. Always measure 
your milk. To one yeast-cake you can safely add two quarts, 
or three if the yeast is good and fresh. To the flour add 
one tablespoon of butter, one-half tablespoon of lard, one table- 
spoon of sugar, and one tablespoon of salt. Mix well with the 
flour. Make a hole in the centre and add the milk, next add 
the yeast which you have in the cup to the milk. Mix all well 
together in the bread-pan, adding flour so that you can handle 
it easily. Take it out, lay it on a board, and work well until it 
does not stick to the hands or board, and feels like velvet in 
your hands. When your bread is thoroughly mixed, there will 
appear little bubbles in the dough. Put it back into the pan 
and let it rise over night. In the morning form it into loaves, 
without using any flour or kneading it. Put it into pans and 
let it rise well. Bake in a moderate oven one hour and a half. 

The longer the bread bakes, the sweeter and more wholesome 
it is. A good baker can always tell when bread is well baked

by the sweet odor which comes from the bread on opening the 
oven door ; or if, by taking it in your hand and putting it to 
your ear, you do not detect any hissing, then your bread is 
thoroughly baked. The secret of making good bread is, first, 
have fresh yeast ; second, have your milk of an even tempera- 
ture, neither too hot nor too cold ; third, kneading it well ; 
fourth, keeping it in a warm place, and not forcing it to rise ; 
fifth, having your oven moderate, so that it bakes slowly and 
thoroughly all the way through. 

French Rolls 

One pint of milk, one yeast-cake, whites of two eggs, one 
tablespoon of butter, one tablespoon of sugar, one tablespoon of 
salt, two pounds of flour, or about that quantity. Put your 
yeast-cake in one cup of tepid water and let it stand one hour. 
This is a good way to test yeast ; when it rises to the top, it is 
good. At this j)oint add one heaping tablespoon of flour and 
let it stand until it is required. Scald the milk and let it get 
cold, but not chilled. Sift the flour into a bowl, pour the milk 
in the centre, then add salt, sugar, and butter. It is a good 
plan to add the butter to the milk when it is nearly cold. Next 
add the whites of the eggs, which must be whipped very light. 
Mix well without adding any extra flour, and lastly add the 
yeast. Mix all together with a wire whisk until it is so that 
you can work it with your hands. Then take it out of the bowl 
and work well on a board until it will not stick to the hands or 
board. Put back into the pan and let it rise. When light, take 
out small pieces, roll with the hands on the board, and put them 
in pans close together, so they will keep their shape, and let

log-cabin style. 

Parker House Rolls 

One quart and a half of flour, one tablespoon of lard, three 
gills of boiled milk cooled, one-half cup of granulated sugar, 
and three-quarters of a cake of yeast dissolved in quarter of a 
cup of water. Make a hole in the centre of the flour and put 
in the other ingredients. Mix as if making sponge and let it 
rise over night, keeping it moderately warm. In the morning 
knead thoroughly and leave it to rise till noon, then cut with 
a biscuit cutter. Spread one-half of each biscuit with butter, 
and fold over. Place in a pan and leave to rise until nearly 
time to serve. Bake in hot oven for twenty minutes. 



Rolls 

Half a yeast-cake, one pint of milk, one quart of flour, one 
tablespoon of lard. Mix thoroughly and set in a moderately 
warm place until very light. Then knead the dough a little, 
make it into rolls, and place in pans. When they have risen, 
bake in quick oven. 

Potato Yeast 

One quart of potatoes sliced, two quarts and a half of warm 
water, a small bag of hops tied in a cloth. Boil slowly until the 
potatoes are soft. Place in a colander three heaping iron table- 
spoons of flour and over it pour the potatoes and water boiling 
hot. Mash this through the colander, strain, and mash again 
through the colander to avoid lumps. Pour this into a pan or 
crock and add to it one cup of white sugar, one iron tablespoon 
of salt, and one teaspoon of ginger. Let this cool until just 
tepid and add one cake of Fleischman's yeast dissolved. Set 
to rise in a warm place. When very light, bottle.

Oneida Rye and Indian Bread 
Make a sponge over night with a yeast-cake soaked in a cup 
and a half of water and mixed with wheat flour. Next morn- 
ing scald a quart of water and a pint of molasses together and 
in it stir four and a half pints of corn meal. When this is cool, 
add it to the sponge and also add a heaped pint of rye meal, 
one pint of bread crumbs well soaked and mashed, and an even 
teaspoon of soda. Mix all thoroughly and set to rise. When 
the dough is light, separate it in two loaves and put in tins to 
rise a little more. Bake in a moderate oven for three hours. 

Boston Brown Bread 

One cup of white flour, one cup of yellow Indian meal, one 

cup of Graham flour, two cups of milk, one and one-third cups 

of molasses, one ^^^, one teaspoon of soda, and a pinch of salt. 

Mix the white, Graham flour, and Indian meal, and sift into a 

large bowl. Then stir in the other ingredients, adding the soda 

last. Pour into a steamer and boil for three hours. Be sure 

the lid of the steamer is tied tightly so no water can get to the 

bread. 

Raised Muffins 

Mix one-half pint of water with one-half pint of milk. Dis- 
solve one-half cake of compressed yeast, stir with the milk and 
water, and add a little salt, one teaspoon of granulated sugar, 
and flour enough to make a stiff batter. Mix at night. The 
next morning arrange muffin rings on a griddle which is par- 
tially warmed. Fill each ring half full with the batter and 
let it rise till even with the top of the ring. Now place the 
griddle over a good fire and bake the muffins until they are a 
light brown. Turn with pancake turner. 

Laplanders 
Beat three eggs, add three cups of flour, three cups of sweet 
milk, one tablespoon of melted butter, and a little salt. Beat

well together and pour into buttered moulds. Bake in a hot 
oven. 

English Muffins 

One pint of flour, half a teaspoon of sugar, half a teaspoon 
of salt, one teaspoon of baking powder, half a pint of milk, 
and two eggs. Sift the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder 
together. Mix the yolks of the eggs with the milk and gradu- 
ally stir into the flour. Last of all, add the whites beaten stiff. 
Bake on a griddle in muffin rings. 

French Popovers 

Two cups of milk, one cup of flour, four eggs, and a pinch 
of salt. Put the flour into a bowl, add one cup of milk, and 
then the eggs, one after the other. Do not beat the eggs. 
When all the eggs are worked in, add the other cup of milk. 
Stir with a wire whisk. Little mixing is required. Put pop- 
over pans on top of the range, having rubbed a small piece of 
butter in each one. Fill the pans three-quarters full and bake 
in a moderate oven thirty minutes. 

Simple Popovers 

Sift two cups of flour with half a teaspoon of salt. Add 
gradually two cups of milk and mix very smooth. Then add 
two eggs unbeaten and, after mixing thoroughly, a teaspoon of 
melted butter. Beat all well together and with the batter fill 
half full stoneware popover cups which have been well but- 
tered with cold butter. Have a good hot oven and set the 
cups in it. There will come out a rich brown puff which may 
be eaten with cream and sugar, with a golden syrup, or with 
butter and berries.

you have a stiff dough. Knead until thoroughly mixed and 
then beat with your rolling pin. Turn the dough over and 
over until it blisters and puffs out. It is now ready for form- 
ing into biscuits, which you do by pulling off a small piece, 
forming in any shape you choose, pricking with a fork, and 
baking in a quick oven fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Virginia "Wafers 

One quart of flour, a piece of butter the size of an egg, the 
yolks of two eggs, and milk enough so that you can roll the 
dough very thin. Beat the dough with a rolling pin half an hour 
or more, until it blisters, and then roll it as thin as paper. Cut 
out the biscuit, prick them with a fork, and bake two or three 
minutes. 

Philadelphia Muffins 

Boil and mash four potatoes, rub them into a quart of flour, 
add one tablespoon of butter, a little salt, half a small teacup 
of yeast, four eggs, and half a teaspoon of fine sugar. Mix at

in long tins three-quarters of an hour. 

Rusk 

Dissolve four ounces of butter in one pint of warm milk, 
add two pounds of flour, eight ounces of sugar mixed in the 
flour, a little salt, and a teacup of yeast. Set the sponge at 
night and knead it into a light dough in the morning. Let it 
rise well. Roll the dough half an inch thick, cut out the rusks, 
and let them rise again. Beat an egg and brush over the top 
with a feather and bake in a hot oven. 

Velvet Cakes 

Mix two teaspoons of cream of tartar in one quart of flour 
and one teaspoon of soda in one pint of milk. Add one cup of 
sugar and one-third of a cup of butter. Mix thoroughly and 
bake in hot earthen cups half an hour. 

Corn Bread 

One cup of Indian meal, one cup of flour, one cup of milk, 
one teaspoon of baking powder, two eggs, one tablespoon of 
butter, one tablespoon of sugar. Sift the meal and flour into 
a bowl, then add the salt, sugar, and baking powder. Beat the 
yolks of the eggs, add them to the milk, and mix them with the 



BREADS, PASTES, AND PIES 367 

flour, etc. Stir in the melted butter, then the well-beaten 
whites of eggs, and beat all thoroughly. Butter your pans, 
dust off with flour, fill them two-thirds full, and bake from 
fifteen to twenty minutes. The batter can be put in shallow 
pans, and when nearly baked, cut into squares. Put back into 
the oven till a nice brown. When about to serve, break into 
squares. 

Corn Bread 

Half a pint of yellow Indian meal, half a pint of flour, half 
a cup of granulated sugar, two eggs, butter the size of a wal- 
nut, two teaspoons of baking powder sifted with the flour, and 
a little salt. Mix with enough milk to make the batter quite 
thin. Bake in a buttered pan in a hot oven. Cut in squares 
before removing it from the pan. 

Corn Bread 

Take one cup of flour, one cup of sour milk, half a cup of 
meal, one-third of a cup of molasses, two tablespoons of melted 
butter, one teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of soda, the yolks 
of two eggs, and the white of one. Mix well and bake in a 
buttered pan in a hot oven. 

Nantucket Corn Bread 

Scald one pint of meal in one quart of sweet milk. Add 
butter the size of an egg, one teaspoon of salt, one tablespoon 
of sugar, and four eggs well beaten. Mix well and bake in an 
oven not too hot. 

St. Louis Corn Bread 

Mix one pint of corn meal, one heaping teaspoon of sugar, 
one heaping teaspoon of salt, and add one egg not beaten. 
Stir together with the buttermilk, making the batter quite 
thin. Set a tin baking pan on the stove, heat hot, melt in it 



368 MRS. seelt's cook book 

one tablespoon of butter and one of larcl. Pour the mixture 
into the hot fat and with a fork lightly stir in the butter and 
lard. Bake in a steady oven, not too hot, or the bread will 
crack. When the bread is brown, stand the tin on an inverted 
pie plate and bake five or six minutes longer. 

Waffles 

Three eggs, one pint of milk, half a cup of butter, flour 
enough to make a thin batter, two teaspoons of baking powder 
sifted in the mixture, a little salt. Mix well and bake on a 
well-greased waffle iron. See that the iron is hot before pour- 
ing in the batter. 

Waffles 

Cream one-half pound of butter, stirring one way. Add 
one tablespoon of flour and one egg. Mix thoroughly, then 
add another tablespoon of flour and one egg. Continue this 
till eight of each have been stirred in. Always beat the same 
way. Flavor with a little orange juice. Have the waffle iron 
hot and well greased. Drop the dough and bake to a light 
brown. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and cinnamon. Serve 
hot. 

Batter Cakes 

Two pints of flour, three eggs, one even teaspoon of soda, 
one teaspoon of melted butter, and a little salt. Place the 
flour in a saucepan — tin for lightness, and with a handle, as 
easier to manage. Separate the whites and the yolks of the 
eggs and add the yolks, without beating, to the flour, then stir 
in the buttermilk, mixing slowly. When half mixed, drop in 
the melted butter and beat the mixture hard and smooth. 
Add more buttermilk, finishing it by leaving the batter rather 
thick, as the whites of the eggs will thin it still more. Then 
add the soda, dissolved in cold water, and lastly the beaten 



BBEABS, PASTES, AND PIES 369 

whites. Take out the spoon and stir in by lightly beating the 
whites in the batter with a fork. When baking, lay the spoon 
on a plate, that is, do not lay it again in the batter, as it will 
make the cakes heavy. 

For the griddle use beef suet which has been tried out and 
is hard. Waffles are made by this same receipt. 

Wheat Flour Griddle Cakes 

Mix one pint of milk with three eggs, the yolks and whites 
beaten separately. Add four tablespoons of melted butter. 
Sift one and a half cups of flour with one and a half teaspoons 
of baking powder. Add to the above and bake on a hot 
griddle. 

Buckwheat Cakes 

Dissolve half of a compressed yeast-cake in a cup of water, 
mix it with one pint of water, a pinch of salt, and enough buck- 
wheat flour to make a stiff batter. Mix at night, and set the 
batter in a moderately warm place where it will rise. In the 
morning stir the batter briskly, add a tablespoon of molasses 
to make the cakes brown. Should the batter be a little sour, 
dissolve one-quarter of a teaspoon of soda in a little warm 
water and stir it in well. 

St. Louis Buckwheat Cakes 

One pint of buckwheat, one handful of Graham flour, half 
a cup of home-made yeast, salt. Add enough tepid water to 
make a moderately thick batter and beat well. Set this to rise 
early in the evening in a warm place. In the morning add a 
pinch of soda, dissolved, and one tablespoon of molasses and 
stir well. Bake on a griddle greased with beef suet. 

Buckwheat, being heavy, requires all night to lighten. Be 
sure the batter is not too thick when you are ready to bake. 
If it is, add water to thin it.

Corn Meal Batter Cakes 

Mix thoroughly a pint of meal, half that quantity of flour, 
two teaspoons of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Pour 
over this gradually and stir in a quart of fresh milk heated and 
a heaping iron spoon of butter, dripping, or lard. Mix thor- 
oughly again and beat well. Drop with a spoon and bake on 
a hot griddle. An Qgg or two is sometimes added to this 
receipt. If the corn meal swells a great deal and absorbs the 
milk so that the batter is too thick, add more milk. 

Hoe Cakes 

Mix together a pint of freshly ground yellow corn meal, a 
teaspoon of salt, and two teaspoons of sugar. Over the mixture 
pour enough boiling water to wet it, but not enough to make 
it spread. The water should be boiling, and the meal will 
swell and absorb it if it is hot. Stir well one way. Kub a 
piece of fat bacon over a hot griddle, drop the batter on it 
from a spoon, and gently flat the cake till it is not more than 
half an inch thick. Cook to a golden brown on both sides. A 
small piece of butter may be laid upon the cake as it is turned, 
or the butter may be omitted and the cakes sent to the table 
for dressing. Such cakes are often eaten with scraped maple 
sugar and cream, or again with butter and maple syrup. 

Barley Meal Scones 

In making barley meal scones, proceed as in making cream 
scones, or merely mix fine fresh barley meal with a teaspoon of 
salt and enough hot milk to make a stiff paste. On a floured 
board roll out this paste and cut it in cakes. Bake in a quick 
oven or on a hot griddle upon which fat has been rubbed. 
Serve hot, and buttered if you choose. 



BREADS, PASTES, AND PIES 371 

Cream Scones 

Having brought to the boiling-point in a saucepan a pint of 
cream, sift in flour enough to make a thick batter and add a 
teaspoon of salt. Put the paste upon a floured board, roll it to 
the thickness of a quarter of an inch, cut in small cakes, and 
cook on a hot griddle ten or fifteen minutes. When brown on 
one side, turn them lightly and brown on the other. Serve on 
a folded napkin. 

Oatmeal Wafers 

Make a batter or dough by stirring together oatmeal, hot 
water, and a little salt. Take the batter on a well-floured 
board, knead it, roll it as thin as possible, cut out in round 
cakes, and cook them till brown and crisp on a griddle. When 
they have browned on one side, they should be turned lightly 
and browned on the other. 

Rice Griddle Cakes 

Wash and scald one cup of rice and drain, and cover with 
boiling water. Cook about half an hour, or until the grains 
are tender. Drain in a colander. Prepare the following bat- 
ter : Sift one teaspoon of baking powder with one cup of flour 
and add a pinch of salt. With this mix one pint of milk with 
three well-beaten eggs and add three tablespoons of melted 
butter, and just before baking stir in the rice. Spread in 
spoonfuls on well-greased hot griddle and brown on both sides. 

Rye Drop Cakes 

Beat separately the yolks and whites of five eggs. Stir 
them together and then stir in one pint and a half of rye flour, 
one pint and four spoonfuls of milk, a pinch of salt, and a piece 
of soda as large as a pea. Put in hot earthen cups and bake. 



372 MRS. seelt's cook book 

Flannel Cakes 

Pour one pint of hot milk over two ounces of butter, add 
five eggs, one pint of cold milk, flour enough to make a stiff 
batter, one teaspoon of salt, and two tablespoons of yeast. Set 
the batter in a warm place and let it rise for three hours. 
Butter a griddle and drop on in small cakes. 

Puff Paste 

One pound of butter, one cup of ice water, one pound of 
flour, half a teaspoon of salt. Wash the butter in ice water 
until it is of a creamy substance. Pat it out in a long narrow 
strip with the hand, put it in cheese cloth, and lay flat on the 
ice. Weigh the flour and sift it into a bowl and add salt. 
Mix well and then add water gradually. Mix well, using up 
all your flour. Put your pastry on a board and work well for 
ten minutes, or until it is tough and will not break when 
pulled. The best way to work it is to slap it well on the board 
and to pound it with the rolling pin. By the time your paste 
is well pounded little puffs will appear — this is a very good 
way to test it. Put your paste in the ice-box for twenty min- 
utes, then put it on a board, and with your hands draw it out 
a little longer and wider than your butter. Lay the butter in 
the centre of the paste and fold up, first from the right, then 
from the left, then from you, then next to you. Dust your 
board lightly with flour and turn the folded side of the paste 
on the board. Roll it out, taking care that the butter does not 
come out. Fold it up, giving it three folds, and put it on the 
ice for twenty minutes. Roll out twice more and fold up as 
directed, put it on the ice again for twenty minutes, roll out 
twice more, folding as before. This makes the fourth rolling. 
Put it away in the ice-box until it is well chilled. Cut the 
patties the same size. Take one piece of paste and brush it 
with ice water, then take the second piece and with a small

cutter cut a hole in the centre ; place it on top of the first 
piece, and brush the top and side with the yolk of a well- 
beaten egg. After your patties are in the baking pan, give 
them one hour in the ice-box before you place them in a hot 
oven. Bake about twenty-five or thirty minutes. Care and 
judgment must be used while they are baking. 

Cheese Straws 

Use two ounces of butter, two ounces of grated American 
cheese, four ounces of flour, and one egg, salt and white pepper 
to taste, and a dash of cayenne. Work the ingredients with 
your hand; they become a smooth dough. Roll the dough 
out thin, cut in straws four inches long, and bake on tin sheets 
in a quick oven. 

Cheese Biscuit 

Over puff paste, well rolled out, grate as much well-flavored 
cheese as will thickly cover the paste. Dash upon the cheese 
a slight dust of cayenne, fold the paste over, and roll out thin. 
After you have cut the biscuit in the shape you choose, brush 
them with a paste brush dipped in beaten egg and bake a light 
brown in a quick oven upon a floured baking sheet. 

Cheese Pudding 

With two beaten eggs stir half an ounce of melted butter 
and half a gill of cream. When these are well mixed, add a 
tablespoon of sifted bread crumbs and half a pound of grated 
cheese. Mix thoroughly and bake in a dish lined with puff 
paste. 

Cream Cannelons 

Roll out puff paste very thin, cut it in strips, say two by 
three inches, and roll them round floured round sticks, making 
the edges of the paste meet and forming a continuous paste

roll, or, if you like, you may wrap it so that it will have the 
twist of a corkscrew. Bake, and after the baking and the can- 
nelons are cool, remove the sticks. The centres may then be 
filled with whipped cream. Preserves and jellies are also used 
as a filling. To heighten their appearance, the cannelons may 
be brushed with the white of an egg, dusted with sugar, and 
heated again to form a glaze. 

, Pastry Roulade 

Roll puff paste very thin, cut it in strips four inches long 
and one and a half inches wide. Roll on sticks which are 
about as large in circumference as a five-cent piece, and which 
you buy for the purpose. Place on a tin sheet and bake in a 
quick oven. Fill with whipped cream, apple sauce, or cream 
and preserves mixed together. 

Log Cabin Dessert 

Cut strips of pastry three inches long and one inch wide. 
When baked, spread each strip with jam and place them on a 
dish, log cabin style. Fill the centre space with whipped cream. 

Metropolitan Cake 

Roll puff paste about a quarter of an inch thick and cut out 
two pieces each about eight inches square. Take one square 
and spread the centre with marmalade of apricots or peaches. 
Take the other square, brush the under part with cold water, 
and place it on the marmalade. Press the edges of pastry to- 
gether. Brush the top with beaten egg. Bake on baking sheet 
in moderate oven for fifteen minutes. Sprinkle with powdered 
sugar. 

Pastry Ramekins 

Roll some puff paste rather thin, sprinkle it with Parmesan 
cheese, then fold it over. Repeat this three times. Cut with 



BREADS, PASTES, AND PIES 375 

a paste cutter any shape desired, brush these pieces with the 
yolk of an egg, and bake in a quick oven. When done, serve 
them at once. 

Surprise Pastry 

Roll puff paste out thin and bake in two round jelly tins. 
Slice peaches, bananas, or any kind of fruit, and put between 
the layers. Cover the whole completely with whipped cream. 

Macro tes, a Jewish Receipt 

Take one pound of French roll dough, six ounces of fresh 
butter, two eggs, and as much flour as will be necessary to knead 
these together. Roll it in the form of a long French roll and 
cut off thin round slices. Set them at a short distance from 
the fire to rise, and when light fry in the best Florence oil. 
When nearly cold, dip them in clarified sugar flavored with 
essence of lemon. 

Pie Pastry- 
Have at hand two quarts of sifted flour, one cup of lard, one 
of butter, one tablespoon of salt, two of sugar, and one cup and 
a half of cold water. Put one cup of the flour into a bowl with 
the salt, sugar, lard, and butter. Chop until all are thoroughly 
blended and then pour in the water gradually. When it is 
well mixed, you should have a stiff paste. Sprinkle some of the 
flour from the half cup on a board, put the paste on it, and roll 
it with a floured rolling pin until it is about one-quarter of an 
inch thick. Fold the paste over and roll it out again. Do this 
three or four times. Then put it on ice, so that it will become 
chilled. Lard may be omitted and all butter used ; if so, you 
will need two cups and a half instead of one cup of butter. 
Lard makes the paste richer and more tender, but butter gives 
it the good flavor. Use as little flour as possible on the mould- 
ing board. 



376 MBS. seely's cook book 

Pie Pastry 

Mix one very full hand of flour, or two handfuls for an 
upper and an under crust, and a little salt. Some time before 
making the pastry, place lard in a bowl with a good piece of ice 
and water. When the lard is very firm, take one heaping table- 
spoon of lard to each handful of flour. Mix quickly with a 
spoon and handle as little as possible, that the heat of the hand 
may not affect it. Wet with the ice water just soft enough to 
roll easily. Use a good deal of flour in rolling and a heavy 
rolling pin, and fold and roll the crust twice. Bake in a well- 
heated oven. Pastry is best baked as quickly as possible, with- 
out turning. 

Apple Pie 

Slice the apples and rinse them in cold water. Set on the 
stove with a very little sugar and stew until they are half done. 
Place in the crust, add water, and bake. When done, with a 
sharp knife remove the upper crust, sweeten to taste, add a good- 
sized piece of butter, and if desired, nutmeg. Return the crust, 
and when cold sift over the pie powdered sugar. 

To prepare Fruit for Pies 

Always stew the fruit before placing it in a pie or a crust. 
Sugar and flavor and sprinkle over it a little flour before putting 
on the upper crust. 

Cream Pie 

Pour one pint of cream over one cup of sugar. Add the 
beaten whites of four eggs and a pinch of salt. Flavor with 
nutmeg and bake without an upper crust.

of three eggs with half a cup of granulated sugar, add the 
grated rind of one lemon and the juice of two lemons, and stir 
into the corn-starch. Line a pie dish with pastry, fill with the 
lemon mixture, and bake in a moderate oven. Beat the whites 
of the eggs to a stiff froth with half a cup of sugar, flavor with 
lemon. Spread the meringue over the pie and place in a quick 
oven long enough to become a delicate brown. 



Lemon Pie 

Grate the rind and squeeze the juice of two large lemons, add 
three cups of sugar, four eggs, yolks and whites beaten sepa- 
rately, four tablespoons of flour, two teacups of water, and the 
last thing the whites of the eggs. Bake without an upper 
crust. 

Lemon Pie 

First grate the rind of a fine large lemon, take out the pulp 
and chop it with a chopping knife. Then mix one cup of water, 
one cup of sugar (or half a cup of molasses and half a cup of 
sugar), one tablespoon of flour dissolved, and set this mixture 
in a pot of hot water over the fire to thicken, stirring constantly. 
When well thickened, pour it over the chopped lemon. After 
it cools a little, add one beaten egg. Bake in a deep pan with 
both upper and under crust. Make a rich pastry for it. 



Orange Pie 

Take two fine oranges and grate the rind and all except the 
leathery dividing skin of the centre, carefully taking out all 
the seeds. Add one cup of sugar, three tablespoons of cream, 
and the yolks of three eggs. Make a meringue of the whites 
of the eggs and a little sugar. Bake with an under crust.

one pound of sugar, a quarter of a pound of butter, six eggs, 
the whites well beaten, and the grated rind and peel of one 
lemon. Let the hot potatoes fall from the colander on the butter 
and mix well. Add the yolks of the eggs and the sugar well 
beaten together, the lemon, and lastly the whites of the eggs 
stirred in lightly. Pour into a paste-lined dish and bake. This 
receipt makes two pies. 

Pumpkin Pie 

Mix one quart of milk with two teacups of strained boiled 
pumpkin, one cup of granulated sugar, three well-beaten eggs, 
one teaspoon of ground cinnamon, one teaspoon of ginger, and 
salt to taste. Line pie dishes with pie pastry and fill with the

CANDIES, PRESERVES, AND PICKLES 

Salted Almonds 

Shell the necessary quantity of almonds and pour boiling 
water over them. Then remove the skins. For each cup of 
almonds add one tablespoon of olive oil. Mix them well and 
let them soak for an hour. Sprinkle them with salt, a table- 
spoon to each cup. Bake in moderate oven until they are a 
delicate brown. While baking, occasionally shake the pan. 

Candied Rose Leaves 

Put half a pound of granulated sugar, three drops of lemon, 
and half a cup of water in a saucepan. Let the liquid boil to a 
crack. Test by dropping a little in cold water. When it will 
snap apart and stick to your fingers, it is done. Remove from 
the fire. Stir and rub against the side of the saucepan until 
cool — not cold. The constant stirring and rubbing make the 
liquid white and granular. Dip each rose leaf in this, roll 
round, and spread on a well-oiled board to dry. 

Syrup to Fasten Rose Leaves to Cake 

Boil one cup of granulated sugar and four tablespoons of 
water until, when tested, the syrup sticks to your fingers and 
forms a thread. Dip the ends of the leaves in this and with a 
brush moisten the cake where the leaf is to be applied.

Candy Dough 

In one glass put the white of an egg^ in another one put an 
equal quantity of water. Mix them slowly with half a pound 
of icing sugar and stir until it is dough-like. 

Almond Creams 

Blanch the almonds and cover them with candy dough. 
The outsides may be varied in looks to suit the taste. 

Cream Dates 

From fresh dates take out the stones. Lay a roll of candy 
dough in its place, press together, and lay away to stiffen. 

Chocolate Creams 

Boil together for five minutes half a cup of cream and two 
cups of granulated sugar. Set the dish in another of cold water 
and stir till the cream is hard enough to make into balls, first 
flavoring with vanilla. Melt the chocolate, and dip in the balls. 

Chocolate Cream Caramels 

Put twelve ounces of chocolate in a saucepan with one pint 
of chocolate syrup — sold by any grocer, or made after receipt 
on page 395, — and one tablespoon of vanilla. When the liquid 
begins to melt, add one pint of rich cream and one pound and a 
half of granulated sugar. Let all come to a boil, and when it 
begins to boil, stir it constantly until it becomes a large ball — 
which will be in about ten minutes. Pour into slightly oiled 
pans or on a marble slab. This caramel will take a long time 
to cool. Cut in long strips, then across in inch squares. Fold 
each one in oil paper as you cut it.

and after heating add two heaping tablespoons of chocolate 
and a piece of butter the size of an egg. Boil for twenty or 
thirty minutes. To test it, stir a little in a saucer. If it 
hardens when cold, it is fudge. As you take it from the fire, 
you may add a teaspoon of vanilla and some walnut meats, say 
a cup to the above proportions, or not, just as you please. 
Either with or without, it is fudge. When it is once off the 
fire, stir the mixture till it begins to stiffen, pour it in shallow 
buttered pans, mark off into squares, and set away to cool.

one of water, and two of butter. Pour in a buttered dish and 
set away to cool. 

Sugared Popcorn 

Take one cup of brown sugar, three tablespoons of water, 
and a lump of butter. Let the mixture boil until it holds 
together in water. Then add three quarts of popped corn and 
stir well. Care should be taken to use a kettle large enough 
to hold the corn. 

Candied Popcorn 

Cook one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, and three cups 
of molasses together until the mixture hardens in water, then 
stir in the popped corn. 

Old-fashioned Cough Candy- 
Pour over a gill of whole flaxseed half a pint of boiling 
water. In another dish, holding a cup of slippery elm, pour also 
enough boiling water to cover. Let these stand for two hours, 
then strain both into a porcelain kettle containing a pound and

CANDIES, PRESERVES, AND PICKLES 385 

Glazed Fruits 

Put two pounds of cut sugar and two gills of cold water in a 
sugar boiler over the fire and boil until the top is covered with 
large bubbles. Test it by dropping a little into cold water. 
When it snaps, it is done. Wipe the sides of the boiler occa- 
sionally to remove the sugar that is apt to collect. Remove the 
boiler from the fire and dip the fruits in the sugar. Then lay 
them on a dish rubbed with a little olive oil. 

Cranberry Jelly a la Cereal 

Put one quart of cranberries with three cups of sugar and 
half a cup of hot water in a porcelain-lined saucepan over a 
slow fire for ten minutes, or until the sugar is thoroughly melted. 
Do not let them boil. Be careful not to stir them. Shake the 
saucepan back and forth on the range. When the sugar is 
dissolved, and the syrup is a bright red, pour the jelly in moulds 
to jell. The berries must be whole. 

Cranberry Jelly 

One quart of cranberries, one pint of granulated sugar, and 
half a pint of water. Cook the cranberries in the water for 
twenty minutes. Then rub through a fine sieve and add the 
sugar. Cook ten minutes longer. Do not add more or less of 
the liquid or sugar, or the jelly will not mould. It should boil 
all the time it is cooking. The time during which an article is 
coming to the boiling-point cannot be counted by any rule. 
The moment the liquid has cooked ten minutes, turn it into a 
mould and set it in a cool place for twelve hours or more. 
Cranberries should always be cooked in porcelain. 

Currant Jelly 

Remove the leaves, not the stems, and carefully pick over 
and wash the currants. Drain thoroughly. Put them in a 
2c 



386 3fRS. seelt's .cook book 

porcelain -lined preserving kettle and stew until they are reduced 
to a soft pulp. Rub the pulp through a colander. Then strain 
twice through a flannel bag. Be sure to get all the juice. 
Measure it, and to one pint of juice have one pound and a 
quarter of granulated sugar. Put the sugar where it will 
become thoroughly warmed, — on the shelf over the range is a 
good place. Boil the juice eighteen minutes after it begins to 
boil. Remove, and gradually stir in the warm sugar. Stir until 
the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, or when it jells the sugar 
will come to the top. Pour into jelly glasses and set in a cool 
place. The second or third day, soak pieces of white paper in 
alcohol, brandy, or whiskey, put them on the jelly, and cover 
the glasses with paper or tin cover. 

Preserved Apples 

Peal, core, and chop two pounds of fine acid apples. Mean- 
while have boiling two pounds of sugar, three gills of water, 
and two ounces of ginger. When this syrup is thick, stir in 
the two pounds of chopped apples and boil till the apples are 
thick and clear. 

Brandied Peaches 

Select ripe White Heath peaches, rub each one smooth and 
clean, and boil until tender in syrup made as follows : A pound 
and a half of granulated sugar thoroughly dissolved in one 
quart of hot water. When the peaches are cooked, you can 
test them with a broom straw. Place them on a dish to cool. 
If you desire them extra strong of spirits, cover them with pure 
spirits or white brandy. When they have cooled, drain them 
and ascertain their weight. To one pound of fruit have half 
a pound of granulated sugar. Dissolve the sugar in a little 
water, place it on the stove and let it come to a boil, skim it, 
and to each pint of sugar syrup add one pint of fresh brandy 



CANDIES, PRESERVES, AND PICKLES 387 

or spirits. Place the peaches in ghxss jars, fill each one with the 
hot syrup. The jars must have air-tight covers and be sealed 
while the contents are very hot. 



Brandied Pears 
Peal the pears and follow the receipt for peaches. 

Brandied Plums 

Prick the plums and proceed as for brandied peaches, cook- 
ing the fruit less. 

Spiced Pears 

Take one teaspoon of whole cloves, one tablespoon of all- 
spice, and one tablespoon of cinnamon. Crush them slightly 
and boil one minute in a quart of vinegar and a pint of sugar 
mixed. Select a fine variety of pear, halve them, taking out 
the seeds, boil them in water until nearly tender, and finish 
them in the syrup, cooking them not too soft. Cover them 
well with syrup and place them in small, stone jars. Tie a cover 
over the jar. 

Spiced Peaches 

Are made the same as spiced pears, except that they are not 
boiled in water. The syrup will cook them sufficiently. 

Black Raspberry Jam 

Take one crate of berries, and, dividing them, crush one-half, 
heat in a preserving kettle, and then put them through a sieve. 
Add the liquid to the other half of the berries, set them over 
the fire, add a quarter of a pound of sugar to each box of berries, 
and boil till the jam is thick. Put in glasses, cover with para- 
fin, and set away for use.

Take twelve boxes of berries, the juice of seven fine lemons, 
and ten pounds of sugar. Cook thoroughly in a preserving 
kettle and put in glasses, as in above receipt. 

Rhubarb 

Wash and cut in small pieces one pound of fresh rhubarb. 
Put in a baking dish with one cup of sugar, a cup of water, 
the thinnest possible shaving of lemon peel, and a bit of ginger. 
Cover and bake. When quite tender, remove from the oven 
and set aside to cool, removing the bits of lemon peel. Put 
two tablespoons of gelatine to soak in cold water and then 
dissolve it in a little hot water. Add to the rhubarb with 
a tables^DOon of lemon juice. Pour into a mould and let it 
harden on the ice. Serve with whipped cream. 

Rhubarb Jelly- 
Rhubarb jelly is made by putting the rhubarb, cut in small 
pieces, to cook in just enough water to cover it. Add a bit 
of lemon peel and cook slowly for ten minutes. For every 
pound of the rhubarb — weighed before it is cooked — add half 
a pound of sugar. Add gelatine enough to make a good, firm 
jelly when cold. 

Strawberry Preserves 

Weigh one pound of granulated sugar to one pound of 
large, ripe strawberries. Hull the berries, and, if it is nec- 
essary, wash them before hulling, and drain and thoroughly 
dry them. Place the sugar in a preserving kettle, with just 
enough water to prevent the sugar sticking to the bottom, and 
boil until it becomes a thick syrup. Skim off the scum that 
comes to the top. When the syrup is thick and clear, drop in 



CANDIES, PBESERVES, AND PICKLES 389 

enough berries to float on the top, but not to crowd them. 
Let them boil twenty minutes. Remove them carefully — do 
not break them — and put them in air-tight jars. Boil the 
syrup for half an hour and while hot strain over the berries. 
Seal the jars and set them in a cool place. 

Wintergreen Berry Jam a la Polonaise 

After cleaning the berries, scald them for a moment, then 
take half a pound of sugar to one pound of berries, and cook in 
a porcelain kettle until the berries are clear and transparent. 
Grate orange rind very fine and add as a flavoring to taste. 
The berries should be stirred while cooking to prevent burning. 

Chili Sauce 

Chop and boil together two hours six dozen large, ripe toma- 
toes, one dozen green peppers, one dozen white onions, twelve 
tablespoons of salt, twenty-four tablespoons of brown sugar, 
twelve teaspoons each of ginger, cloves, and cinnamon. The 
kettle used here, as in cooking all acids, should be porcelain. 
While hot pour in bottles and seal hermetically. 

Chili Sauce 

Have at hand eighteen ripe tomatoes, six onions, six small 
red peppers, nine tablespoons of sugar, two cups of vinegar, 
and salt to taste. Peel the tomatoes and onions and remove 
the seeds and core from the peppers. Chop all very fine, add 
the sugar and salt, and boil in a porcelain kettle until the 
sauce becomes thick. While hot pour in air-tight jars. 

Pepper Hash 

Take one good-sized cabbage chopped fine, remove the 
seeds and core from twelve green peppers and two red peppers, 



390 MRS. seely's cook book 

chop them, also two small teacups of grated horseradish, two 
ounces of whole cloves, two ounces of white mustard seed, half 
an ounce of celery seed, and about two quarts of cider vinegar. 
Sprinkle the chopped cabbage with salt. Let it stand for an 
hour. Then with the hand squeeze out all the water. After 
chopping the peppers, cover them with salt. Let them stand 
one hour. Press all the water from them through a colander 
or sieve, using a spoon, for the liquid would burn the hands. 
Mix all together and cover with vinegar. 

Cucumber Pickle 

Make a brine strong enough to hold up an egg. When 
boiling hot, pour over six hundred pickles and four green pep- 
pers. The pickles must be covered with the brine. Let them 
stand for twenty-four hours. Drain and thoroughly dry each 
one, then cover with boiling vinegar, and stand for twenty- 
four hours. Drain, heat fresh vinegar, and add the following 
ingredients to it: One ounce of whole cloves, one ounce of cin- 
namon sticks, one ounce of whole allspice, two quarts of brown 
sugar, half a pint of whole mustard seed, and four tablespoons 
of whole celery seed. While this mixture is boiling hot, pour 
it over the cucumbers. Place in a stone crock or glass jars. 
Remove the cores and nearly all the seeds from the peppers. 

Stuffed Cucumbers 
Pack medium-sized cucumbers in dry salt. In two weeks 
take them from the brine, soak them three days in fresh water, 
changing the water each day. Without rinsing, place them in 
a kettle in layers, between each layer add sliced onion, red 
(Chili) pepper, strips of horseradish, and a small quantity of 
sugar. When the kettle is half full, place in the middle a 
small quantity of whole spice — cinnamon, allspice, and cloves 
(less of cloves) — tied in a cloth. Cover with cold vinegar. 



CANDIES, PRESERVES, AND PICKLES 391 

Stand on the stove and let them slowly come to a boil, and at 
once take them off and place in jars. 

Open the cucumbers lengthwise, cut a small piece out of 
each half, fill the opening with strips of horseradish and black 
and white mustard seeds, wet with olive oil. Put the two 
halves together and tie with narrow strips of cheese-cloth. 
Put the cucumbers back in the vinegar to keep until needed. 
Serve after cutting and removing the binding. 

French Pickle 

Three quarts of sliced green tomatoes, one quart of sliced 
white onions, and three quarts of peeled and sliced cucumbers. 
Place all in a stone jar and sprinkle with one cup of salt. Let 
them stand twenty-four hours, then drain off the water and 
add half an ounce of celery seed, a quarter of an ounce of 
cloves or mace, one teacup of white mustard seed, and half a 
cup of black pepper. Blend one tablespoon of tumeric with a 
little water and two tablespoons of ground mustard. Add to 
the pickles and cover with one gallon of the best cider vinegar. 

Oil Pickle 

Peel and slice rather thick one hundred large cucumbers. 
Place them in a colander with salt between the layers. Put 
one-third as many white onions as you have cucumbers in a 
colander, and treat in the same manner as the cucumbers. Let 
them stand for three hours. Mix one-half pound of Coleman's 
mustard the same as you would for table use. Spread a layer 
of cucumbers in the bottom of a stone jar, then a layer of 
onions, then mustard, then moisten with olive oil. You will 
need one quart of oil for the above quantity. Spread another 
layer of cucumbers, onions, etc., and continue until the jar is 
two-thirds full. Cover all -with cold vinegar. Tie a cloth 
over the jar and set in a cool place for a month or six weeks.

Half a peck of green tomatoes, a dozen onions, half a dozen 
red peppers, half a dozen green peppers, half a pound of white 
mustard seed, and two ounces of celery seed. Slice the toma- 
toes in a stone jar and sprinkle salt between each layer. 
Cover with boiling water and let them stand over night. In 
the morning drain them thoroughly and scald them in a 
liquid made half of vinegar and half of water. Drain again. 
Place in a stone jar alternate layers of the tomatoes and the

place them in an earthen crock in layers. Sprinkle each layer 
lightly with salt and in the morning drain off the water. 
Remove the seeds and cores from the peppers, chop the onions, 
peppers, and tomatoes in small pieces, mix with the other 
ingredients in a porcelain-lined kettle, cover with cider vine- 
gar, and stew gently until tender. Place in an earthen crock 
or in glass jars. Keep in a cool place. 



CHAPTER XVI 

BEVERAGES 
Beverages 

Always observe the following rules when compounding 
any cold beverage : — 

Be sure to serve it ice cold and not too sweet. Have one 
piece of ice as large as possible, to use in the pitcher or bowl 
intended for serving. Small pieces of ice melt quickly and 
weaken the beverages. The sugar, fruit, and all ingredients, 
except the wine^ ice^ and carbonated tuater, should be mixed 
thoroughly and placed in the ice-box for at least three-quarters 
of an hour before they are served. Fifteen minutes before 
serving add the wine, except Champagne, stir well, and pour 
into the pitcher or bowl in which a large piece of ice has just 
been placed. Champagne and any carbonated water should not 
be added until just before serving. 

Barley Water 

Wipe very clean two tablespoons of pearl barley. Put it in 
a quart jug with three or four lumps of sugar, a pinch or two 
of salt, and a strip of lemon peel. Fill up the jug with boiling 
water and shake the mixture gently for some minutes. Then 
cover it and let it stand until perfectly cold. In twelve hours 
it will be fit for use. Made in this way the barley water will 
be comparatively clear and soft and pleasant to drink. 

If the flavor of lemon is unpalatable to the invalid, or the 
sugar makes it too sweet, these ingredients may be omitted or 
modified. 

393 



394 MBS. seelt's cook book 

A glass of calf's-foot jelly added to the barley is much 
appreciated by some. After the barley water has been poured 
off, the jug may be filled a second time with boiling water. 

Barley Water 

Put two ounces of well-washed pearl barley in a porcelain- 
lined saucepan with a quart of water, the grated rind and juice 
of a lemon, and two ounces of seeded raisins. Boil steadily 
until the liquor is reduced one-half. Strain and sweeten while 
warm. 

Barley Negas 

Boil two tablespoons of barley in a quart of water. Add 
a pint of Sherry, the juice of half a large lemon, a dash of nut- 
meg, and sweeten to taste. 

A Bishop 

Stick cloves in the rind of a lemon or orange and roast it 
a long time before a slow fire. Put equal quantities of cinna- 
mon, cloves, allspice, and mace into a little water, and boil 
them until the whole strength is extracted. Boil a bottle of 
Port or claret wine and put the roast lemon and spice into it. 
Sweeten, and add the juice of half a lemon and grate in some 
nutmeg. Serve hot with the lemon and spice floating in it. 

Blackberry Cordial 

Heat the berries, press them through a colander, and strain 
the juice. To three pints of juice use one pound of sugar. 
Tie in a small bag the whole spice of cinnamon, clove, and 
allspice. Use clove very sparingly. Boil fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Add California brandy to taste. 



BEVERAGES 395

serve at once. 

Boiled CoJaFee 

Use as much ground coffee as is needed, allowing one table- 
spoon of coffee to one cup of boiling water. Place on the range, 
and when it comes to a boil, uncover and remove from the fire. 
Let it stand two or three minutes, then cover it, and replace 
over the fire. The instant it boils, remove and let it stand 
five minutes. It is then ready to serve. Sometimes an egg 
is beaten up and with a little cold water is mixed with the 
coffee before the boiling water is poured on. This is to clear it. 

Black Coffee 
Place six tablespoons of ground coffee in the strainer of 
a drip coffee-pot. Pour over it three cups of boiling water. 
Let it stand a minute or two after it has drained and then 
serve. The coffee must be ground very fine and the water 
must be boiling. 



BEVERAGES 397 

Austrian Coffee 
A coffee of the above name, sometimes served at teas and 
receptions, is a cold, strong coffee, creamed and sweetened. It 
is served in small glasses, with a tablespoon of ice cream added 
to each glass after the coffee is put in. 

A Breakfast Coffee 

Three-quarters of a teacup of ground coffee, Java and 
Mocha mixed. Three-quarters of a pint of cold water. Stir 
together the yolk and white of an egg, and pour a third with 
a piece of the shell into the coffee. Mix well, add a pint and 
a half of boiling water, and boil quickly five minutes. Stir 
the coffee, set back, and boil slowly ten or fifteen minutes 
more, and add a little cold water to settle. Strain into the

Champagne and one quart of Apollinaris. 



398 MRS. seelt's cook book 

Claret Cup 
Ice the claret in the bottle, also the club soda. Do not 
put ice in the pitcher. Mix one teaspoon ful of crushed mint 
juice with the juice of one lemon, one teaspoonful of sugar, two 
ponies of brandy, two ponies of curagoa. When thoroughly 
mixed in a glass pitcher, add one bottle of claret and one bottle 
of club soda fresh from the ice, the thin peel of a whole lemon, 
a few slices of orange and pineapple, and decorate the top with 
a bunch of young mint, which has been slightly dampened and 
sprinkled with powdered sugar it give it a frosted appearance. 

Claret Cup 

Five lumps of sugar dissolved in water, one liqueur glass 
of Medford rum, one quart of good claret, one orange and one 
lime sliced thin, and the juice of one lemon. Place the paring 
of a cucumber and a large piece of ice in a good-sized pitcher, 
stir thoroughly, and after a few moments remove the cucumber 
rind. Then add one bottle of club soda and place a bunch of 
mint in the pitcher. 

Champagne may be used in place of the soda. In place 

of the cucumber and mint use sliced pineapple and any small 

fruit. 

Military Cup 

Into a tumbler put five small lumps of ice and over the ice 
squeeze a lemon. The lemon should be a fine one and good 
for six vigorous squeezes before it is dry. After the lemon 
juice has trickled over the ice, throw in two teaspoons of fine 
sugar, and over the sugar pour claret until the ice is covered. 
Shake the mixture and pour it in a punch bowl which you have 
close at hand. In the tumbler make the same mixture five more 
times. At length when the punch bowl holds the claret, lemon 
juice, sugar, and ice pour in its midst a tablespoon of Benedic- 
tine cordial. Ladle this in freely and then add a quarter of a 
wine-glass of fine brandy. If you choose, add also half a glass 



BEVERAGES 399 

of Sherry. Stir well with the ladle and if you like float a half 
dozen berries on the punch. Serve by ladling a glass half full 
of the punch and then filling it with iced seltzer. The seltzer 
should be put in with such force that it will mix with the 
punch. Place a paper straw or two in each glass. 

Moselle Cup 

To four small lumps of sugar dissolved in a little water, add 
one quart of Moselle wine, one liqueur glass of Medford rum, one 
orange and one lime — both sliced thin. Pour all in a pitcher 
over a large piece of ice and place on ice. When thoroughly 
chilled add one bottle of club soda. Place a bunch of mint 
stems down in the top of the pitcher. Crush a leaf or two of 
mint with some sugar in the bottom of the pitcher before you 
pour in the ingredients. 

Rhine Wine Cup 
Ice the Rhine wine and club soda in a glass pitcher. In 
a glass pitcher mix one glass of maraschino with one glass of 
curagoa. Add one quart of Rhine wine and a bottle of club 
soda. Decorate with thinly sliced fruits and place a bunch of 
verbena on top just before serving. Do not have any ice in 
the pitcher. 

Bgg Flip 

To three beaten eggs add a quarter of a pound of sugar and 
a pint of boiling water, stirring well, and adding the water a 
little at a time. When the water is well stirred in, add half a 
pint of brandy and half a gill of rum and serve hot. 

Egg Lemonade 

Make a good New York lemonade by using one lemon to a 

tumbler. Add sugar enough to make it of the sweetness your 

taste wishes — it gains by being on the side of sour, that is, in 

wanting a little in sweetness, and then break into the tumbler 



400 MBS. SEELY'S COOK BOOK 

an absolutely fresh egg. Fill the glass nearly full of Vichy, or 
ApoUinaris, or of pure cold water, and shake vigorously, hav- 
ing capped the tumbler with a metal shaker. When the egg 
is well lost in the liquid, it is ready to drink cold. 

Egg Nog 

Put a little shaved ice in a large glass and add one egg, 
half a wine-glass of brandy, half a wine-glass of Santa Cruz 
rum, and a large teaspoonful of powdered sugar. Fill the glass 
with rich milk and shake it until the ingredients are thoroughly 
mixed. Strain into another glass, grate a little nutmeg on the 
top, and serve. This may be made by using a wine-glass of 
either of the above liquors instead of both combined. 

Egg Wine 

Break a nice fresh egg into a tumbler and beat it until it is 
smooth and thick. Add a tablespoon of pulverized sugar and 
stir in a glass of the best Port wine. This is very strengthening 
for an invalid to take about the hour of noon, if the physician 
permits it. When wine is not allowed, a glass of new milk may 
be used instead. 

Gin Rickey 

Put two lumps of ice in a tall glass, add the juice of half a 
lime, the desired amount of gin, and then fill the glass with cold 
seltzer water. 

Gum Syrup 

Boil one generous pound of loaf sugar with one pint of 
water for five minutes, then add enough hot water to make it 
up to one quart. Bottle and use when needed. 

High Ball 
Put some cracked ice in a tall glass, add a half or full whis- 
key glass of Scotch whiskey. Fill the glass with seltzer. Twist 
a small piece of lemon rind in and serve at once. 



BEVERAGES 401 

Hot Scotch 

Rub five lumps of sugar over the outside of a fresh lemon so 
that all the oil is absorbed. Place these in an earthen pitcher 
and add five Sherry glasses of the best Scotch whiskey. Light 
this and stir continually until it burns out. Add seven glasses 
of boiling water and serve at once. 

Lemonade 

The juice of twelve large lemons, thirty lumps of sugar 
thoroughly dissolved in a little water, and three quarts of water. 
Pour all in a pitcher with plenty of ice. This will serve ten or 
twelve people. 

Soda Lemonade 

Dissolve eight lumps of sugar in a little water and add the 
juice of three lemons. Pour into a glass pitcher over ice and 
add two bottles of club soda which is thoroughly chilled and 
one large lemon sliced thin. This will be enough for three 
persons. 

Apollinaris Lemonade 

Make Apollinaris lemonade the same way, substituting one 
and one-half pints of Apollinaris in place of soda water. 

Mint Julep 
Put one-half teaspoonful of orange bitters in a large glass 
with three sprigs of mint. Crush the mint in the bitters and 
then add one Sherry glass of Italian vermouth and one Sherry 
glass of rye whiskey. Fill the glass about one-quarter full of 
finely shaved ice, stir a little, then fill the glass with fine ice. 
Add a few thin slices of orange and pineapple, a few straw- 
berries, and two or three sprigs of mint. Insert two straws and 
serve. Handle the glass carefully so as not to destroy the 
frosting on the outside of the glass.

Mint Julep 

Strip tender leaves of mint into a tumbler and add to them 
as much wine, brandy, or other spirit as you wish to use. Put 
pounded ice into a second tumbler, pour over it the mint and 
wine, and continue to pour the mixture from one tumbler to the 
other until it is flavored with the mint to your taste. The oily 
flavor of the mint is extracted by the particles of ice striking 
the leaves as they pass from one tumbler to the other. Finally 
pack the glass with the julep in a large glass with pounded ice. 
Serve with care not to destroy the frost work on the glass. 

Alexandra Punch 
Pour one generous pint of boiling water over four teaspoon- 
fuls of Oolong tea. Let it stand five minutes, then strain. 
When it is cold, add the juice of two oranges, two lemons, one 
spare pint of brandy, two Sherry glasses of green Chartreuse, 
and one quart Jamaica rum. Sweeten to taste and strain. 
Place a large lump of ice in a bowl and pour the mixture over 
it. Remove the seeds from two oranges and one lime. Slice 
them thin, add to the above. Lastly, pour in one quart of 
Champagne and serve at once. 

Champagne Punch 
Three teaspoonfuls of tea steeped five minutes in one pint 
of boiling water. Strain and stand away to cool. When cold, 
add one sliced orange, which has been peeled, six lumps of loaf 
sugar, five tJiin slices of pineapple, two liqueur glasses of brandy, 
two of maraschino, and two of Medford rum. Mix, and then 
add one quart of Champagne, one bottle of plain cold soda, and 
one-half pint Rhine wine. Pour in a punch bowl and serve at 
once. 

Fruit Punch 

Three sca7it Sherry glasses of curagoa, the juice of three 
large lemons, one pint of fruit crushed with a little sugar, and 



BEVERAGES 403 

half a pint of brandy. Use either peaches or red raspberries 
with the above. Mix, and add two and one-half pints of claret. 
Sweeten to taste. Strain through a bag made of flannel and 
then add a quart and a half of Champagne and one pint of 
Apollinaris. If you cannot get the fresh fruit, you may substi- 
tute fruit syrups. Do not use sugar, should you use the syrup. 

Mexican Punch 
Mix one quart of Madeira, one pint of brandy, two Sherry 
glasses of Jamaica rum, one pint of Port wine, and the juice of 
six lemons. Peel and remove the seeds of eight oranges, slice 
them in the mixture, and sweeten to taste. Pour in a covered 
vessel (not metal) and set away in a cool place for four days. 
Three-quarters of an hour before using strain and pour into a 
punch bowl in which there is a big piece of ice. Add two 
quarts of Champagne just before serving. 

Milk Punch 
Put two small lumps of ice in a large glass and add one 
teaspoonful of fine white sugar, one wine-glass of brandy, and 
one-half wine-glass of Santa Cruz rum. Fill the glass with rich 
milk, shake it, and then strain into another glass. Grate a 
little nutmeg in the milk and serve. 

Roman Punch 
The ingredients are four quarts of Jamaica rum, three 
quarts of water, five pints of boiling milk, three pounds of loaf 
sugar, twenty-four lemons, and two nutmegs. Cut only the 
yellow of the lemons in thin slices. Let these and the nutmegs 
infuse for twenty-four hours in a warm place in one quart of 
the rum. Put into a large vessel the water, sugar, rum, and 
the rum the lemon has been in, and also the juice of the lemons. 
When the sugar is dissolved, add the milk boiling. It will 
curdle. Cover, and let the mixture stand one hour, and then 
filter it through a flannel bag till it is bright and clear as crystal. 



404 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

This amount will fill one dozen quart bottles. It is better with 
age. A tablespoon of it over lemon ice makes a delicious dish. 

Whiskey Punch 
Have a good-sized pitcher with two large pieces of ice in it. 
Pour in one pint of good whiskey, Bourbon, and the juice of 
four lemons. Stir the mixture thoroughly with a spoon and 
then add two bottles of ginger ale — Cantrells' is the best — 
and six teaspoons of granulated sugar. 

Boot Beer 

This wholesome drink, which was made every spring in the 
households of our American forbears, is delicious as well as 
healthful, and it is a pity that the use of genuine root beer is 
dying out. The sarsaparilla, yellow dock, dandelion, burdock, 
and hops used for its making were all products of the near-by 
woods and fields. Bark of the wild cherry was sometimes put 
in, birch bark also, and elecampane, and the aromatic spikenard. 
In springtime children went out with trowel and basket, and 
their intimate knowledge of the growths about them helped to 
their brewing. 

The roots should be all thoroughly washed and then bruised. 
To two gallons of water take an ounce each of the ingredients. 
Put the roots in the cold water and set them over the fire so 
that the heating will draw all the essences and flavors of the 
growths. Let them steep about half an hour and then strain. 
Add a pound of sugar and about twenty-five drops of the oil of 
sassafras or spruce, and, when the brew is cool enough not to 
kill the yeast, add say six or eight tablespoons to the above 
quantity of water, or a dry yeast-cake or two dissolved in a 
little tepid water. Stir the yeast in well and set the brew away 
in an earthen jar and give it some hours to work. After three 
or four hours it may be bottled or kept in the jar for immediate 
drinking without bottling. 



BEVERAGES 405 

Currant Shrub 

Add a pound of sugar to a pint of strained currant juice. 
Boil the sugar and juice gently together in a porcelain kettle, 
and, after boiling eight or ten minutes, set it where it will cool. 
When lukewarm, add a wine-glass of French brandy to every 
pint of syrup. Bottle, cork tight, and keep in a cool place. 

Lemon Shrub 

To a pint of the juice of fine fresh lemons put a pound of 
sugar. Measure out for each pint of the syrup three tablespoons 
of French brandy, and soak the thin rind of the lemons in it. 
Let the whole remain a day, stirring up the lemon juice and 
sugar frequently. The next day turn off the syrup and mix it 
with the brandy and lemon rinds. Put in clean bottles, cork 
and seal tight, and keep in a cool place. 

Raspberry Shrub 

To three quarts of fresh ripe raspberries put one quart of 
good vinegar. Let them remain together in a porcelain dish for 
a day, strain and boil and put to each pint of juice a pound of 
white sugar. Boil the whole together for half an hour and 
skim it clear. When cool, add a wine-glass of French brandy 
to each pint of the shrub. 

A couple of tablespoons of this mixed with a tumbler two- 
thirds full of water is a wholesome and refreshing drink in 
fevers. 

Raspberry Shrub 

Pour one quart of vinegar over six quarts of red raspberries 
and let it stand twenty-four hours. Strain and add one pound 
of granulated sugar to one pint of juice. Scald twenty minutes. 
Bottle and cork tightly. 



406 MBS. SJEELT'S COOK BOOK 

Strawberry Vinegar 
Place the strawberries without water in a preserving kettle, 
let them heat until the juice is well drawn, and add sugar to 
make very sweet. Boil ten or fifteen minutes until rich, then 
add vinegar enough to taste a trifle acid. 

Raspberry Vinegar 
Is made in the same way. 

Sherry Cobbler 

Put in a glass five scant tablespoons of Sherry with a half a 
tablespoon of powdered sugar, one thin slice of lemon, and two 
thin slices of orange, and fill scantily with crushed ice. Place 
the shaker over the glass and shake it hard. Garnish with any 
small fruits in season. Candied cherries may be used if fresh 
fruits are not at hand. Serve with two straws. Any still wine 
may be used if preferred to Sherry. 

Stone Pence 
Pour one wine-glass of Bourbon or rye whiskey in a large 
bar glass, add two or three small lumps of ice, and fill the glass 
with sweet cider. 

Tea 
First scald the teapot and then allow one teaspoonful of tea 
for each cup of boiling water, and an extra one for the pot. 
Let stand for a few minutes and then serve. English breakfast 
tea should stand at least five minutes before it is served. 

Russian Tea 
Pour just enough boiling water over three generous table- 
spoons of English breakfast tea to cover it. Let it stand a 
minute, then draw the water off. Pour in half a pony of 
Jamaica rum and three pints of boiling water. Leave it to 



BEVERAGES 407 

steep for three or four minutes. Serve in cups with thin slices 
of lemon, powdered sugar, and a decanter of Jamaica rum on a 

tray. 

Tom and Jerry- 
Beat together to a perfect froth four eggs, six large table- 
spoons of pulverized sugar, and six wine-glasses of St. Croix 
rum, and one pint of boiling water. Have ready two pitchers, 
both heated, and turn the mixture back and forth from one 
pitcher to another. Serve in hot glasses, having grated nut- 
meg over each glassful and drink at once. 

Whips 
One quart of cream, half a pint of wine, half a pound of 
sugar, the whites of three eggs, and the grated rind and juice 
of one lemon. 

Whips 

Take a pint of rather thin cream, add sugar to make it quite 
sweet, then a large wine-glass of wine and a tablespoon of the 
extract of lemon. Let this stand in a cool place while you are 
beating to a stiff froth the whites of three or four eggs. Add 
this to the cream, stirring rapidly. Serve in large-sized wine- 
glasses. 

Innocent Wine 

Pick from their stalks fine grapes of either the Concord, 
Diana, Delaware, or Muscatel variety. Lay them in a strong 
straining cloth in an earthen dish or jar, and bruise or break 
them, with a wooden masher preferable. Hang them in the 
cloth to drain and squeeze out all the juice, which will carry 
with it a portion of the colored tissue lying next the skin and 
holding the delicious aroma of the grape. Stir in liquid 
sugar to sweeten it. Have especial care that you do not get it 
too sweet — that is a fault of inexperienced cooks and of the 
untried palate. Melt the sugar thin with fresh cold water. In 
adding the water use judgment, the proportion is sometimes a 



408 MRS. SEELT'S COOK BOOK 

third part of water. Set the mixture on ice and serve ice-cold 
in a glass pitcher containing ice. 

This is a wholesome and delicious afternoon-tea drink taken 
with biscuit slightly sweetened. 

Mulled Wine 

To a pint of water add a teaspoon of powdered cloves and 
cinnamon and set where it will boil. Beat the yolks of three 
eggs with a teaspoon of powdered sugar, and as soon as the 
water boils turn it on the yolks and sugar. Add a pint of wine 
and stir in the beaten whites of the eggs. Serve hot. 

Wine Whey 
Set on the fire in a porcelain saucepan a pint of milk. When 
it boils, pour in as much white wine as will turn it to curds. 
Boil it up, let the curds settle, strain off, add a little boiling 
water, and sweeten to taste.
